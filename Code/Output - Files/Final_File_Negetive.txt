0 ===> story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig . starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy . a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane  violent mob by the crazy chantings of it  s singers . unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting . even those from the era should be turned off . the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader . on a technical level it  s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond . future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly .

1 ===> homelessness  or houselessness as george carlin stated  has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school  work  or vote for the matter . most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism  the war on iraq  pressuring kids to succeed  technology  the elections  inflation  or worrying if they  ll be next to end up on the streets .  br    br   but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home  the entertainment sets  a bathroom  pictures on the wall  a computer  and everything you once treasure to see what it  s like to be homeless  that is goddard bolt  s lesson .  br    br   mel brooks  who directs  who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival  jeffery tambor  to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds  he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings . the bet  s on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can  t step off the sidewalk . he  s given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it  s written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly  lesley ann warren  an ex  dancer who got divorce before losing her home  and her pals sailor  howard morris  and fumes  teddy wilson  who are already used to the streets . they  re survivors . bolt isn  t . he  s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it  s fight or flight  kill or be killed .  br    br   while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn  t necessary to plot  i found  life stinks  to be one of mel brooks  observant films where prior to being a comedy  it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles  young frankenstein  or spaceballs for the matter  to show what it  s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don  t know what to do with their money . maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money .  br    br   or maybe this film will inspire you to help others .

2 ===> brilliant over  acting by lesley ann warren . best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen  and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none . the corn on face is a classic  as good as anything in blazing saddles . the take on lawyers is also superb . after being accused of being a turncoat  selling out his boss  and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently  i  m a lawyer  he says . three funny words . jeffrey tambor  a favorite from the later larry sanders show  is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto . his character is more malevolent than usual . the hospital scene  and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site  are all  time classics . look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting  one bleeds  . this movie gets better each time i see it  which is quite often  .  

=======================================================================================================

3 ===> this film lacked something i couldn  t put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress . this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man . even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play . it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors . i just don  t know .  br    br   but could it have been the screenplay  just exactly who was the chef in love with  he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant  and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits  than of anybody or anything else . he never convinced me he was in love with the princess .  br    br   i was disappointed in this movie . but  don  t forget it was nominated for an oscar  so judge for yourself .  

=======================================================================================================

4 ===> sorry everyone    i know this is supposed to be an  art  film   but wow  they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch . although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent  this story is too painful to watch . the absence of a sound track was brutal . the loooonnnnng shots were too long . how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking  especially when the dialogue is two people complaining . i really had a hard time just getting through this film . the performances were excellent  but how much of that dark  sombre  uninspired  stuff can you take  the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene . otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman . and i  m no fan f his either . i think anyone who says they enjoyed     hours of this is   well  lying .  

=======================================================================================================

5 ===> this is not the typical mel brooks film . it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable . leslie ann warren made the movie  she is such a fantastic  under  rated actress . there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more  and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so  but all in all  this is worth the price to rent and see it . the acting was good overall  brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience . again  warren was the best actor in the movie  but  fume  and  sailor  both played their parts well .  

=======================================================================================================

6 ===> this isn  t the comedic robin williams  nor is it the quirky  insane robin williams of recent thriller fame . this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over  dramatization  mixed with robin  s new love of the thriller . but this isn  t a thriller  per se . this is more a mystery  suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper .  br    br   also starring sandra oh and rory culkin  this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report  until william  s character gets close to achieving his goal .  br    br   i must say that i was highly entertained  though this movie fails to teach  guide  inspect  or amuse . it felt more like i was watching a guy  williams   as he was actually performing the actions  from a third person perspective . in other words  it felt real  and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story .  br    br   all in all  it  s worth a watch  though it  s definitely not friday  saturday night fare .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  

=======================================================================================================

7 ===>   it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable .  and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman . and let  s not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allen  s bergman pretensions  allen  s whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding . what i don  t get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman  but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for  ripping off  hitchcock in his suspense  horror films  in robin wood  s view  it  s a strange form of cultural snobbery . i would have to agree with that .

8 ===> the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than   years to make a  swedish  film  the first being susan sontag  s  brother carl   which was made in sweden  with swedish actors  no less   the results  oscar wilde said it best  in reference to dickens   the old curiosity shop    one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell .  pretty much the same thing here .  interiors  is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers .   i  m afraid of my anger .  looking into the middle distance  i don  t like who i  m becoming .   the directorial quotations  to use a polite term  from bergman are close to parody . the incredibly self  involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are  to the point of strangulation .   i read a poem of yours the other day . it was in  i don  t know  the new yorker .   oh . that was an old poem . i reworked it .   far from not caring about these people  however  i found them quite hilarious . much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen  s earlier films  only he  s directed his actors to play the lines straight . having not cast himself in the movie  he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics  intonations  and neurotic habits  turning her into an embarrassing surrogate  much like kenneth branagh in  celebrity   .  br    br   the basic plot  dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother  seems to be lifted more or less from bergman  s  winter light   the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst . it all comes through in the shopworn visual  aural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper  the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach . etc  etc .  br    br   allen  s later  serious  films are less embarrassing  but also far less entertaining . i  ll take  interiors .  woody  s rarely made a funnier movie .

9 ===> in this  critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events  gabriel  robin williams   a celebrated writer and late  night talk show host  becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother  toni collette  . when troubling questions arise about this boy  s  story   however  gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret  according to film  s official synopsis .  br    br   you really should stop reading these comments  and watch the film now . . .  br    br   the  how did he lose his leg   ending  with ms . collette planning her new life  should be chopped off  and sent to  deleted scenes  land . it  s overkill . the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious  by the time mr . williams returns to new york . possibly  her blindness could be in question  but a revelation could have be made certain in either the  highway  or  video tape  scenes . the film would benefit from a re  editing  how about a  director  s cut    br    br   williams and bobby cannavale  as jess  don  t seem  initially  believable as a couple . a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage . otherwise  the cast is exemplary . williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization  and not a  gay impersonation  . sandra oh  as anna   joe morton  as ashe   and rory culkin  pete logand  are all perfect .  br    br   best of all  collette  s  donna  belongs in the creepy hall of fame . ms . oh is correct in saying collette might be   you know  like that guy from  psycho  .  there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women  due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly  they could have noticed collette with some award consideration . she is that good . and  director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock  he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful .  br    br   finally  writers stettner  armistead maupin  and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere .  br    br    the night listener          patrick stettner  robin williams  toni collette  sandra oh  rory culkin

10 ===> the night listener           robin williams  toni collette  bobby cannavale  rory culkin  joe morton  sandra oh  john cullum  lisa emery  becky ann baker .  dir patrick stettner   br    br   hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand  out low  key performance .  br    br   what is it about celebrities and fans  what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm   br    br   in the latest derange fan scenario  based on true events no less  williams stars as a talk  radio personality named gabriel no one  who reads stories he  s penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand  culkin  who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one  s editor ashe  morton  who gives it to no one to read for himself .  br    br   no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna  collette giving an excellent performance  who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids . naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess  cannavale  whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete  s backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn  t anticipate .  br    br   written by armistead maupin  who co  wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film  s novice director stettner  and based on a true story about a fan  s hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot  boiler does . it helps that williams gives a stand  out  low  key performance as the conflicted good  hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him  the one thing that has escaped his own reality  and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core .  br    br   however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner  it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for .  

=======================================================================================================

11 ===> this film is mediocre at best . angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers . her bitchy demeanor from  law and order  carries over in a failed attempt at comedy . charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti  comedy . the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise  s marriage . hopefully that effort produces better results .  

=======================================================================================================

12 ===> the film is bad . there is no other way to say it . the story is weak and outdated  especially for this country . i don  t think most people know what a  walker  is or will really care . i felt as if i was watching a movie from the    s . the subject was just not believable for the year      even being set in dc . i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end . most didn  t stay for the qa either .  br    br   i don  t think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time . many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn  t know how to finish them . he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on . i really didn  t get woody  s  carter  private life or boyfriend either . what were all the  artistic  male bondage and torture pictures  from iraq prisons  about  what was he thinking  i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody  s character  car  . it didn  t work . it didn  t even seem to make sense really .  br    br   the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson . he played his character  car  flawlessly . you really did get a great sense of what a  walker  may have been like  say twenty years ago  . he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it .  br    br   as for lauren  lily and kristin . . . boring .  br    br   don  t see it  it is painful  unless you are a true harrelson fan .  

=======================================================================================================

13 ===> when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves . that being said  we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood . . .  br    br   writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded   br    br   with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life  jess  and the world around him  donna  .  br    br   as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably . the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward .  br    br   it  s to bad that most people will avoid this film . i only say that because the average american will probably think  robin williams in a serious role  that didn  t work before   please give this movie a chance  robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people . like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art .  br    br   oh and before i forget  i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in . he has the      s leading man looks and screen presence . it  s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now    br    br   s  

=======================================================================================================

14 ===> i liked the film . some of the action scenes were very interesting  tense and well done . i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it . a very tense action scene that seemed well done .  br    br   some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography  unusual colors  or interesting angles . also the film is funny is several parts . i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too . i  d give the film an  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

15 ===> the plot for descent  if it actually can be called a plot  has two noteworthy events . one near the beginning  one at the end . together these events make up maybe   of the total movie time . everything  and i mean  everything   in between is basically the director  s desperate effort to fill in the minutes . i like disturbing movies  i like dark movies and i don  t get troubled by gritty scenes  but if you expect me to sit through   minutes of hazy  dark  literally  scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming . rosario dawson  one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here . and no  she doesn  t get naked  not even in the nc    version  which i saw .  br    br   if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch  descent   take a nap instead  you  ll probably have more interesting dreams .  

=======================================================================================================

16 ===> plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption  murder  power and the rest of thriller related topics . characters are interesting though sometimes . not realistic but interesting nevertheless .  br    br   development is slow like tea drinking ceremony . visuals not stunning  but good enough to ease the eye strain . good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed  nothing shocking too much  nothing overexciting . movie sitcom style .  br    br   i liked woody  excellent performance . had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good . the rest are bearable though very predictable . the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows .  

=======================================================================================================

17 ===> i enjoyed the night listener very much . it  s one of the better movies of the summer .  br    br   robin williams gives one of his best performances . in fact  the entire cast was very good . all played just the right notes for their characters  not too much and not too little . sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch . toni collette is great as the mom  and never goes over the top . everyone is very believable .  br    br   it  s a short movie  just under an hour and a half . i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version . i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie .  br    br   the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion  which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well .  br    br   do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads . it is not a hitchcockian thriller . see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well . if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed .  br    br   my only complaint with the movie was the ending . the director could have left a little more to the audience  s imagination  but this is a minor quibble .  

=======================================================================================================

18 ===> the night listener is probably not one of william  s best roles  but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie . i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before . some people maybe won  t like the slow pacing of this movie  but i think it  s the great plus of the movie . it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year     . it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content  dramatic feeling . this is no americanized movie . neither is it a predictable movie . you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be . this is no excellent movie that has everything  but hell  it  s a damn good and very original movie .  

=======================================================================================================

19 ===> this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years . not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom .  br    br   the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not  nothing is of any interest . the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful  i just sat in utter amazement during this movie  thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining  br    br   the producers of this movie were very clever . they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast . people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think  woody harrison  kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie .  boy are they in for a horrible time   br    br   if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie  some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning  

=======================================================================================================

20 ===> a worn  out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case  the equally worn  out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out .  br    br   with such an outstanding case  one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins . but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity  no character arcs  and inexplicable behavior .  br    br   the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary   or on the other hand  completely unexplored . it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers . when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture   br    br   a regrettably dreadful movie . when will lauren bacall pick a good one  i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas . this one is definitely one to miss .  

=======================================================================================================

21 ===> the night listener held my attention  with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a   year old boy  rory culkin  who is very ill . williams has never met the boy in person  as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone . however  williams  ex  boyfriend  nice job from bobby cannavale  raises doubt about the boy  which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person . what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect . i will leave it at that . toni collette also stars .  br    br   i enjoyed this film  with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin  s adoptive mother . sandra oh also starred as williams  friend . the night listener is inspired by actual events  and it has a somber  almost creepy silence throughout . at times it is predictable  no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic  but i liked it anyway . i enjoy williams in roles like this  more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me . recommended .      

=======================================================================================================

22 ===> popular radio storyteller gabriel no one  robin williams  scraggy and speaking in hushed  hypnotic tones  becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen  year  old boy from wisconsin named pete logand  rory culkin   who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents . to boot  pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still  since his partner jess  bobby cannavale  good  happens to be a survivor of hiv himself .  br    br   he also acquaints himself with pete  s guardian  a woman named donna  toni collette  brilliant   and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin  he discovers some secrets he was  naturally  not prepared to find .  br    br   based on real events that happened to armistead maupin  who co  wrote the screenplay with terry anderson  and directed by patrick stetner  this film moves a lot faster    min .  maybe a few minutes longer  than one might think a movie of this genre would run . that  s good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear . it  s bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn  t sew  up any of the plot openings or back  story . i  d rather not go into any great detail except to say that  if you are not familiar with mr . maupin  s works or his personal story  you feel a little bit out of the loop here . still  the performances by williams  i would  ve loved to heard more of his narration  personally   collette  cannavale  culkin and much of the supporting cast  the waitress at the restaurant collete  s donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has   are top  notch and the mood established here   namely  the chilly  lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york   give a terrific framing for this story . it may have ends that don  t tie together particularly well  but it  s still a compelling enough story to stick with .  

=======================================================================================================

23 ===> ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical      s teens in turmoil movie . it is not a horror or science fiction movie . plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their  hot rod  club because they cannot meet the rent . once kicked out  they decide to try an old haunted house . the only saving grace for the film is that the  ghost   paul blaisdell in the she creature suit  turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell .  

=======================================================================================================

24 ===>   ghost of dragstrip hollow  was one of the many    s movies about hot  rodding teens encountering the supernatural . in this case  the teens can  t pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted . with nowhere else to go  they decide on an apparently haunted house . as you may have guessed  once they arrive  some weird things start happening . and there  s a twist at the end .  br    br   there  s nothing in this movie that you haven  t seen in other movies  but it  s nice entertainment nonetheless . my favorite character was the foul  mouthed parrot . well  let me rephrase that he didn  t talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie  but he said things that we don  t expect out of a bird . the movie  s pure hokum  but harmless .  

=======================================================================================================

25 ===> i absolutely loved this film  i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it . i was completely enthralled through every second   br    br   i found the story gripping  the acting intense  and the direction spot  on . i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie . even though there was nothing  scary  about the story itself  i was soundly on edge through the whole movie  and for the rest of my evening .  br    br   i found that there were so many perfect choices made . . . the casting  the script  the little bits of humor sprinkled in it . there were so many points where the film could  ve gone for the cheap thrill  but it never did  and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately . . . and for the last number of years .  

=======================================================================================================

26 ===> this night listener is better than people are generally saying . it has weaknesses  and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis  no doubt  but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this . the whole thing feels like one of those fireside  this happened to a friend of a friend of mine  ghost stories . one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate . everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility  and real life just sort of plods alongno  so there are no flashy endings or earth  shattering revelations  no  showdown  scenes . thank heaven . you have to get into the zone when watching this movie  forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a  conventionally  good movie . williams isn  t terrific  but he easily meets the needs of the story  plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic   no one   as he is the everyman  the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story . toni collette  s performance should be nominated for an oscar  even if she maybe shouldn  t win it  . give it a shot . for quality and content alone  the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days .  

=======================================================================================================

27 ===> the characters are unlikeable and the script is awful . it  s a waste of the talents of deneuve and auteuil .

29 ===> somewhat funny and well  paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless  fast  talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u . s . treasury agent  david morse  to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief  hacker  doug hutchinson   who stole forty  two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead .  br    br    bait  marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua   the replacement killers   and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn  t top his first movie . what the two films have in common is the action sequences  which are flat  out excellent .  br    br   foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning  but throughout the film  i began to catch on . hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in  marathon man  . morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost .

30 ===> the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico . this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch . karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval  an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty  greedy and backbiting no  count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will . pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life  sized toy people who populate the place . onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of  tintorera  infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character . the clunky  plodding  non  direction  trite by  the  numbers script  ugly  washed  out cinematography  ridiculous murder set pieces  a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon    overwrought string score  morbid gloom  doom atmosphere  largely lousy acting  karloff notably excepted   cheesy mild gore  poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm . a real campy hoot .

31 ===> vijay krishna acharya  s  tashan  is a over  hyped  stylized  product . sure its a one of the most stylish films  but when it comes to content  even the masses will reject this one . why  the films script is as amateur as a  year old baby . script is king  without a good script even the greatest director of all  time cannot do anything . tashan is produced by the most successful production banner  yash raj films  and mega stars appearing in it . but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland . thumbs down   br    br   performances anil kapoor  is a veteran actor . but how could he okay a role like this  akshay kumar is great actor  in fact he  s the sole saving grace . kareena kapoor has never looked so hot . she looks stunning and leaves you  all stand up . saif ali khan doesn  t get his due in here . sanjay mishra  manoj phawa and yashpal sharma are wasted .  br    br    tashan  is a boring film . the films failure at the box office  should you keep away .  

=======================================================================================================

32 ===> the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya . there is no story  no humor  no nothing  the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs  up advertisements stitched together . heavily influenced from the matrix and kung  fu hustle but very poorly executed .  br    br   i did not go a lot of expectations  but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder  what were these guys thinking      .  br    br   the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini .  br    br   the reason why i did not give a rating of    is that every time i think i have seen the worst  bollywood proves me wrong .

33 ===> aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the    s . also he declared that he had murdered another   people  he used to kill pregnant women  and then he set them on fire  .  br    br   this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts .  br    br    aro tolbukhin  is a serious work  so analytical  it  s not morbid at all . such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster .  br    br   my rate      

=======================================================================================================

34 ===> after seeing several movies of villaronga  i had a pretty clear opinion about him   he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters  forgetting about a rhythm of the movie . that is why  though having good critics  his movies never caught the broad audience attention . in aro he follows the same line  but really improved on the rhythm  especially in the end of the movie . frankly speaking  i slept through the first part  cause though the first part gives necessary information  it is really slow . nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga .  br    br   recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

35 ===> shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth you tube standards . i was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction  plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can  throw away  crores on such stupidity . shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to . saif ali khan  completely disappointed in your choice of film . kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and akshay comes up as the dim  wit . anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for english . his cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last   minutes  it was enough to pop a blood vessel . don  t waste any brain cells  energy or your money to go see this  go see  rent amu  with konkana sensharma instead  a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of india . intelligent  poignant and a wonderful story  tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema making .  

=======================================================================================================

36 ===> first lesson that some film makers  particularly those inspired by hollywood  need to know  just  style  does not sell . i guess tashan when translated will mean style . second  if you are hell bent on selling style  that does not spare you from having a decent story .  br    br   tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director . but it is not slick . for example  all three  saif  kareena and akshay  are narrators at different points in the story . but this setup is not utilized to properly . there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations . actions sequences are from the seventies .  br    br   cheoreography of the film is awful . i think vaibhavi merchant just sleep walked through this film . vishal  shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film . why is there a sufi song  dil haara  in tashan  why is the cool hinglish song  dil dance maare  not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy   br    br   akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film . but he is in his stereotyped self . you won  t mind missing this film .  

=======================================================================================================

37 ===> this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen . the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre . this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story . the casts is outstanding  including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before  ever . the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one . my one complaint  i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy  but other then that i think they did a great job . the dialog  the characters and the story was perfect . the acting was wonderful . this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci  fi channel . you heard me  the best movie to come out of the sci  fi channel . i give the fallen ones  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

38 ===> without kirsten miller this project needn  t have been completed . however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it . it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance . wagner  s dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing  but his few scenes didn  t detract from being entertained . mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line  the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster . the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable . she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be . i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost .  

=======================================================================================================

39 ===> i had some expectation for the movie  since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif . well  i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom   but if dhoom  is compared to tashan  i would say dhoom  is very realistic .  br    br   when i saw the credits at the beginning  i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way . well  the very first scene itself pised me off . then  the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences . me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights . it was like akshay against some   thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns  phew . . . you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are .  br    br   the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story . it reminded me of some of the early    s movies .  br    br   well  the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena  who looked really hot in this one . and for that  i give a rating of  out of   .  br    br   guys  please . . please . . . don  t see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie . well  you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes .  br    br   thats all .  

=======================================================================================================

40 ===> the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar . akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in     neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman . it is hilarious . except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film . the story looks like the writer told his   yr old son to write . the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director . except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan . i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody .     is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero .  

=======================================================================================================

41 ===> when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was . this is the only movie i think i would ever give a   star rating . i am sure this movie will always be in my top  .  br    br   the acting is superb . leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best . i don  t think anyone could have a better job than kate .  br    br   if it is a rainy day and you can  t decide what to rent  well  this is the one . you will love all the acting  special effects  and much much more .  br    br   if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now    you won  t regret it .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

42 ===> why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather . titanic is the greatest movie of the   st century . with great acting  directing  effects  music and generally everything . this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn  t like it any more so most of the world decided to agree . there is nothing wrong with this movie . all i can say is that this movie  not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time  the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i  ve ever seen . apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time . the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton . these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron  s masterpiece titanic .  

=======================================================================================================

43 ===> i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted . so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that  it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom    and saif ali khan  s son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback  .  br    br   after watching it  i understood that why their wasn  t a proper trailer because there wasn  t anything in the film to show . the story was extremely dum and even a   year old child can come up with a better story  line . there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it  s difficult to figure out that who is killing who . also the action was daft  unrealistic e . g .  man with a handgun managed to kill about    men with machine guns .  br    br   while i was watching tashan it reminded me of  films  br    br   sin city during the opening credits .  br    br   koyla anil kapoor  s terrible english like amrish puri in koyla .  br    br   jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny .  br    br   i also heard the budget is   crores which is the same amount as dhoom  and i don  t know where all the money went to . anyway if you did not like dhoom  then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan . race was hot on heels and that is a million times better .  br    br   the only  good songs are dil haara  challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film  even anil kapoor  s terrible english couldn  t save this discomfiture .  

=======================================================================================================

44 ===> i don  t want to go too far into detail  because i can  t really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film  but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie . the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring  pointless to extremely irritating . the humor was completely lost on the audience  and yes  ghost in the shell fans  this is not an action sci  fi or anything like that  its an attempt at slapstick comedy  and the humor just did not work after being translated . it was a total chore to watch this movie  and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest  especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything  i wasn  t expecting a ghost in the shell sequel  but i was expecting something entertaining  and it simply didn  t achieve this . yaaawwnnn . . . rent kino  s journey instead .  

=======================================================================================================

45 ===> what  s inexplicable  firstly  the hatred towards this movie . it may not be the greatest movie of all time  but gimme a break  it got   oscars for a reason  it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason . it  s a damn good movie . which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it . i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters . i  ve rewatched it on tv and video  and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen  twice  or maybe three times  actually  . but that might be it  the appeal of it . it  s a movie  yes  capital m there  it  s an epic  it  s a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur . now  ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me  with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama . not that titanic has none of that . well  the acting was actually very good . the melodrama was quite heavy  handed at times .  br    br   but the reason titanic works is that it  s such an emotional ride . i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind  or give me a visual thrill . this movie isn  t exactly dumb  but it  s not cerebral at all . the visual thrills are simply means to an end  to fuel the emotions of the audience . i didn  t cry when bambi  s mom died  i don  t react to tearjerkers . but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million  an emotional rollercoaster that  if it were a regular one  would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl . and i  m sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it  and have a ready supply of cynicism  then you can thoroughly dislike this movie . but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit  if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt  you  ll enjoy it completely . and look at the top ten grossing films of all time . is a single one of them bad  is a single one of them worth a score of  out of    no  not even the phantom menace . and this movie made  .  billion dollars worldwide . it can  t be bad . not possible .      .  br    br   p . s . how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman  spiderman was a fun movie  but it was a total     kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did . it simply wasn  t anything all that special . no one will remember it in   years . but i  m pretty sure titanic will be remembered .  

=======================================================================================================

46 ===> previously  i wrote that i loved  titanic   cried at its ending  many times over   and i  m a guy in his    s . i also wondered about why this great movie  which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics  was given only a  .  rating by imdb . com users .  br    br   well  i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings . while   .   of all votes gave it a   rating    .   gave it a  rating . these   .   of these irrational imdb users  in effect  pulled the overall rating down to  .  .  br    br   in my previous comments  i blamed this very unusual voting pattern  a sudden surge in  ratings  with a high   rating  dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the  rating level  on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio . believe me  i  ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people  young men  mostly   who defame him left and right . they absolutely hate the man  and they will have no part in giving him any credit in  titanic  .  to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn  t like the movie that much  and gave it a  or a   etc . everyone has  and is entitled to  his  her own taste . but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only  .  overall for  titanic   pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous  ratings  is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture .   br    br   let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of  titanic  to  randomly chosen box office and critical  bombs   there are many more  but these  will prove my point  .  heaven  s gate        was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing  and imdb voters  ratings were   .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  big top pee  wee        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  cat people        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  blind date        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   .  jumpin  jack flash        got  .     ratings and  .    ratings  overall rating of  .   . what do all of these films have in common with  titanic   all of the percentages of their  ratings are lower     than  titanic   and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award . again   titanic  got   .    ratings  compare that to the other  movies i just mentioned .  br    br   can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor   br    br    

=======================================================================================================

47 ===> i just saw the movie in theater . the movie has very few good points to talk about . kareena  s beauty and a couple of songs may be . thats it . the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas . anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed  even mumbai indians too  just now chennai has made it to semi  final  .  br    br   but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes . now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood . but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real . but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time . they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie . now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people . but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work . all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded . at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar . this is height of stupidity . audience is not paying to watch such stupidity . i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies . they cant make it . the last good action i have seen was from  ghatak  and  khiladiyon ka khialdi  . the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me . does these people see their movie after completion  can  t they figure out that the slow motion action  which is done using ropes  is too unrealistic and childish  better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it . i just want to go back to amitabh  s era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes . the sound effect was not very effective in those days  but visually it is much better than current era scenes .  br    br   this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors . please don  t make any more action movies  until you acquire the art of making it realistic .  

=======================================================================================================

48 ===> the storyline was okay . akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie . kareena kapoor looked bad . there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner . i don  t know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role . there was nothing much to do for him in the movie . just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is . said ali khan was alright . i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot . what are we  fools     what do they think  they will show  men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them . is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals . . . . they take an entire squad of     policemen and no one was there to surround the palace . the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action . akshay kumar was between a circle of      policemen all shooting at him . . . . . and he shooting back at them . none of the policemen  s bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen . crap . crap .  br    br   i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement .  br    br   i strongly recommend not to see this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

49 ===> the movie titanic makes it much more then just a  night to remember .  it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten . why so criticised  i have no idea . could  will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it . could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece . it will be almost impossible .  br    br   the director no doubt had the major impact on the film . a simple disaster film  boring to watch  converted to an unbelievable romance . yes i  m not the romance type either  but that should not bother you  because you will never see a romance like this . guaranteed  everything to the amazing effects  to the music  to the sublime acting .  br    br   the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling . everything looks very real and live . the legend herself  titanic  is shown brilliantly in all classes  too looks  too accommodation . the acting was the real effect . dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles . no one could have done better . they are partly the reason why the film is so great .  br    br   i guess it  s not too much to talk about . the plot is simple  the acting is brilliant  based on a true story  probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears  thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten . well if you haven  t seen this film your missing out on something hesterical  and a film to idolise for hollywood . could it get better  no . not at all . the most moving film of all time  don  t listen to people  see for yourself then you will understand . a landmark .  don  t be surprised if you cry too   

=======================================================================================================

50 ===> i had few problems with this film  and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated . true  it is over three hours long  but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly . i don  t think it is overrated at all  i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent . the film looks sumptuous  with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects  and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus . leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack  and kate winslet is lovely as rose . david warner  a great actor  steals every scene he  s in . the story is very rich in detail  and is hot on character development  obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be  though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow . the last hour is extremely riveting  and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat  when the titanic sank . i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving . the music score by james horner was lovely  though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on . the     miniseries was good  but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies . overall  i give titanic an  .     . bethany cox .  

=======================================================================================================

51 ===> if there is one film which is the worst of this year  it  s tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom  style film  and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock  it was even worst then dhoom  and what i expected first saif  s introduction which is boring then saif  kareena meet  kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god  what he is doing in such a weird film  what kinda role it is  what acting is he doing  his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes  but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance  overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke  br    br   vijay krishna acharya would have got  films more to direct  if this film had worked  thats the strategy of yashraj  only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music  vishal shekhar  is ordinary  br    br   performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air  he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating  kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay

52 ===> absolutely awful movie . utter waste of time .  br    br   background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech . well if you really listen closely  whatever they speak is actually unintelligible .  br    br   camera work is bad  editing is not present  background score gives a headache  action is shoddy  dialogs are unintelligible  acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler  now she looks like a starved wrestler . hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace .  br    br   after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it  but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure .  br    br   please if you want to torture yourself  go ahead watch this .

53 ===> titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill  fated voyage on the unsinkable ship . writer  director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april        claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic . the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet . they make for a good on  screen couple . dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable . they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well . the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane  kathy bates  frances fisher  jonathan hyde  and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film . the love story  the action  suspense  and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time . the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation . the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it  s few flaws . titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it . the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg . overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill  fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch .

54 ===> the ship may have sunk but the movie didn  t    director  james cameron  from  the terminator  did it again with this amazing picture . one of my favorite scenes is  the dinner table  scene  in which rose  s family and friends meet jack after he saves her . rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet  the one  . . . i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband .  br    br   jack and rose have a connection that is  movie stuff  but it  s good movie stuff . we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth . rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her . i really liked the hanging over the boat scene . it was a good risk .  br    br   the movie is long but it  s fantastic    good story  good flow  good actors    go see it twice if you want  its worth it     

=======================================================================================================

55 ===> i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent  the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest .  br    br   saif has over acted . kareena has improved her figure  but is not a good actress anyway . akshay is good . anil is also good . may i say the role wasn  t good . .  br    br   great deal of cheapness is filled in . wondered if that was supposed to be the  comedy part  of the movie . just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish  it has a history of so many good films .  br    br   overall  i was totally disappointed with the movie .  

=======================================================================================================

56 ===> the film lacks style  i mean original style . everything looks copied including action  first appearances in the movie  songs  dialog delivery  etc etc . yes  there the goof  ups were original  like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh . that was one in many goof  ups of the movie   anything good in the movie  yes  for kareena fans  if there are any  kareena in bikini . for akshay fans  his dialogs and action stunts . thats it . nothing else . so watch it on your own risk and don  t blame the director or actors . director is already insane and actors  i pity them .  

=======================================================================================================

57 ===> titanic is a classic . i was really surprised that this movie didn  t have a solid ten  overall in the imdb user rankings . maybe  it  s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays  but when it was first made it was really something . when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters . when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month . it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason . some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot  like the frozen baby  or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd . many people died on that ship  and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to . and let  s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose . whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone  s imagination it was lovely . they barely knew each other  but they would die for each other . they trusted each other . they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money .  i  ll never let go  jack .  titanic is a great film down to it  s very core . it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting  excellent cinematography  beautiful music  and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers . it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

58 ===> another aussie masterpiece  this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural  and it does very well . it doesn  t resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks  it focuses more on emotional impact . a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney  co . bring to life . it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside  and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago . strange things begin to happen in the house  and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared  who was actually a mass murderer . highly recommended .

59 ===> ok  i am not japanese . i do know a little about japanese culture  and a little less about japanese pop culture . other than that  i am spanish  i eat paella and i like black humor .  br    br   good  with that point set  i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences  mamoru oshii is quite a good director  despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head  and even that was curious and somehow interesting  and i am surprised he came up with this . it may just be one of those lost  in  translation cases  i am afraid it is  but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible . the jokes seemed bad  the script was overcooked  i mean  give the audience a break  and shut up a little you damn narrator  to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast  paced speaking and absurd action .  br    br   however  i thought the animation was really cool . the idea is great  and it is well exploited in those animated scenes . however  the eye  candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo  jumbo speech over still pictures . it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut  out hysterical characters scene .  br    br   i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this . the idea was good but horribly exploited . maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie  or maybe it will be more and more over  narrated scenes . but hell  if you thought talking head was dense  amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke .  br    br   of course  all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european . probably this is totally useless to japanese people  maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation . maybe .

60 ===>  . . . for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all cp must now be compared .  br    br   first off  the beginning did have elements of style . . . . and if handled well  could have become a cult classic  a  la pulp fiction or a desi desperado . . . but the plot  was there one   begins to meander and at one point completely loses it .  br    br   throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english  a call center smart alec  a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb  a levitating  gravity defying hit  man and a cop with a hundred  or was it a thousand  black cat commandos on their trail . . . . good ingredients in competent hands . but this is where i would like to ask the director sir  what were you smoking   br    br   im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making  for what must never be done  insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers .  br    br   possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music . . . watch the videos . . . hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed . vishal  shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes .  br    br   how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy . . . .  br    br   as i sign off  i want to really  badly know how does akshay  s bullet wound vanish in a microsecond . . . what were you editors doing  tashan  maybe . . .

61 ===> back in      do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research  the unfortunate death of princess diana  the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets . this was also the big year in the release of titanic  one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams  about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster . i don  t think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was  the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans     of them being teenage girls  i was   years old at the time  and of course saw the movie multiple times . it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful . at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong  of course i grew up and didn  t watch the film since i was    a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for  .   and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now . was it worth the hype  was it really the best movie of all time  was that leonardo  s real nose  ok  i know that  s silly to say  but i did re  watch the film . being completely honest here  titanic is a great movie  best movie of all time  no  just depends on your idea of a good movie  but titanic delivered in romance  humor  disaster  emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage .  br    br   the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic  searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean . unsuccessful  they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude  wearing the heart of the ocean  dated the day the titanic sank .     year  old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing  and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing . she and her granddaughter elizabeth  lizzy  calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship . when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace  rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic  revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater . in      the upper  class    year  old rose boards the ship with her fianc  cal hockley and her mother  ruth dewitt bukater  both of whom stress the importance of rose  s engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt  bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper  class  rose and her mother are financially broke . distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage  rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern . before she leaps  a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes . jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life  and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first  class formal dinner of the rapport  building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance  music and beer in third  class . but after cal  s servant informs him of rose  s whereabouts   rose is forbidden from seeing jack again . however  after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven  year  old daughter to behave like a  proper lady  at tea  rose defies him and her mother  asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean  an engagement present from cal . after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time  they go to the deck of the ship .  br    br   they then witness the ship  s fatal collision with an iceberg . after overhearing the ship  s lookouts discussing how serious the collision is  rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal . meanwhile  cal discovers rose  s nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe  so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack  s pocket . upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck  rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him . jack and rose return to the top deck . cal and jack  though enemies  both want rose safe  so they persuade her to board a lifeboat . but after realizing that she cannot leave jack  rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship  s first class staircase . jack and rose return to the top deck  the lifeboats have gone  and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down .  br    br   so does titanic live up to it  s hype  i still say that this is a great movie to watch  i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie . but it has great acting  amazing effects  a well  written story and still looks flawless . love it or hate it  you have to admit this movie didn  t get a lot of hype just because of leo  s baby face or kate  s amazing ability to cry on sight  this film is something special . it will always hold a special place in my heart  it has too seeing that i saw this film  times in the theater when it was released . but all that aside  i do recommend this movie  it  s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day .  br    br

63 ===> such a long awaited movie . . but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day . . from the trailers it looked like a action movie  but it turned out to be a out  out comedy  a bad comedy  . but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors  they  ve done their part of the movie very well . good acting  but i don  t think that can save the movie . . india has been shot beautifully . kerala  rajasthan   ladakh   were all saturated with color  alright . nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there     br    br   action sequences were shot very shabbily  no one could make out head  tail of the stunts  they  ve used akki  akshay kumar  very well but could  ve been done much much better . .  br    br   animation is the worst i  ve seen in recent movies     s movies had better animation scenes i guess  initial scene where the car is falling off  flying should be better word  the road into lake  .  br    br   and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every   to   mins  just to make sure audiences don  t forget the movie name i guess . .

65 ===> titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic . the plot is simple  noncomplicated  or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense . the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film  but the love story is an interesting one  however . kate winslett is wonderful as rose  an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal  billy zane  . early on the voyage rose meets jack  leonardo dicaprio   a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game . if he wants something  he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries . the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes .  br    br   the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures  that sunk with the titanic  which has recently occurred . one of the survivors of the titanic  rose dewitt bukater  who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search . she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic . with this  the scene shifts to southhampton  ireland where the titanic set sail from on april        as all the passengers are boarding . after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york . historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful  but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger  jack dawson . captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned . smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty  two years of experience to stretch the titanic  s legs out to full speed . the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs  but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie . on april        at       an iceberg was sighted . they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film . the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate . the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until     when the lights finally failed . the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic  s many pleas for help . the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own . the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship . overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too . the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking . also  the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold  which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle . overall  the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic .  br    br   many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship . the core group of rose  jack  cal  and rose  s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time . yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer  thomas andrew the white star line representative  bruce ismay and all of the titanic  s officers were real . the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith  s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards . he had been a part of the white star line since     where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire  s captain when the titanic sunk . the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol . he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer  s former canadian hometown . as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower  class passengers from non  english speaking nations . in addition  officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted . the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss  . not wanting to leave her husband  s side mrs . strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic . furthermore  mr . goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best . the richest man on the ship  john jacob astor  who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well  but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat . in addition  molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water . her ticket on the titanic had cost over four  thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke . all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware . the gymnasium  which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs . the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re  creation of the post  victorian era of     . the rich at this time practically ruled everything  as the women  s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet . women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do . the rich did not take well to new money  such as molly brown as depicted . everything of the time was very formal . women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes . smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes  which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie . men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes . women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society . although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross  referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken . the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking .  br    br   a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise . the director  james cameron  shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people  s lives . everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night . in addition  this film is a reflection of the      s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic . only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored . this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed . however  the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed . there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed . as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter .  br    br   technically the film is very well done . to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie . in addition  a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean . cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the   years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship . furthermore  throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage . this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner . at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film .  br    br   titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art  a true epic . like most history novels  we know the ending  but it doesn  t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture . certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming  sound  cintematography  and editing . if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early      s and how they face disaster  then this movie definitely is for you .  br    br

66 ===> i find it so amazing that even after all these years  we are still talking about this movie  obviously this movie wasn  t that bad or else people wouldn  t even bother to talk about it . i personally enjoyed this film immensly  and still do  i guess this film isn  t for everyone  but it certainly did touch the hearts of many .  br    br   as for those that think that this film is  overrated  or  over  hyped  . . . well  we only have the movie  going public to thank for that  lol you see  it  s not critics  article writers that make a film  huge  or a  hit  with the general movie  going public . people make the film a huge success . with titanic  everyone was in awe . let  s face it  a film like this had never been made before . at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking . this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april     . even the silverware for goodness sakes matched   br    br   give this movie a break you guys  the critics thought this movie would sink big time  when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth  which is the best form of advertisement mind you  that this was a good  decent  movie worth seeing  then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie . . . not once  not twice  but maybe  times and more  so  i really wouldn  t say that this movie was  overhyped  . . . at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being  overhyped  . ha  critics didn  t even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron  s gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film . however  the films money took care of that    million budget and much more   br    br   personally  i love this film . however  this film might not be for everyone . don  t say that this film sucks just because of romance though  that is the most sexist thing i  ve ever heard  disliking a movie just because it has romance in it  the story was sweet . the dialogue could have been better  but let  s face it . . . the real star of the movie wasn  t leo or kate . . . it was that gigantic ship  i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job . it  s not thier best work  i  ve seen much better work from both of them  but it wasn  t the worst i  ve seen on screen before . give them a break   br    br

67 ===> all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure  but this is not the case . vijay krishna acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor . she was unbearable throughout the film . her tom  boy look does not really goes well . even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all . everyone said that the quetin taratino of india is vijay but its not at all quetin . the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie . anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not . akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif . the style and the phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed  

=======================================================================================================

68 ===> i wasn  t terribly impressed with dante  s  st season offering in  homecoming   it wasn  t much of a horror story  but rather a smart political statement with the undead . screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men  s sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women . the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists . then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home . i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak  but is unclear because this is never revisited . the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah . it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end . the worst episode . well  except for chocolate .

69 ===> to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue  the budget  the this and the that . . . . who wants to hear it  if you missed the point of this beyond  beautiful movie  that  s your loss . the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think . i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life  and this one stands in its own entity  in my book . it was not supposed to be a documentary  or a completely factual account of what happened that night . it is the most amazing love story ever attempted . i know that it is the cynical    s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy  but come on . someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money  how lame is that  it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet  and is the top grossing film in the planet . i will gladly side with the majority this time around . okay  cynics  time to crawl back under your rock  i am done .

70 ===> every once in a while the conversation will turn to  favorite movies .  i  ll mention titanic  and at least a couple people will snicker . i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago  these same people were moved to tears by that very movie . and they  re too embarrassed now to admit it .  br    br   i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time . expecting to simply enjoy the story again  i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years . i cried again . . . . in all the same places . it brought me back to     when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time . a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall  yes  even more than star wars  . and today  many people won  t even admit they enjoyed it . folks  let  s get something straight   you don  t look cool when you badmouth this film . you look like an out of touch cynic .  br    br   no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults . some of the dialogue falls flat  and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly . however  none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film .  br    br   leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful . leo is one of the fine actors of his generation . wait  til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy . kate winslet was so strong in this film . the movie really was hers  and she held it together beautifully .  br    br   james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic . the sinking scenes were horrific  just as they were that night . how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me . i was utterly transfixed .  br    br   this film is one memorable scene after another . titanic leaving port in southampton . rose and jack at the bow   flying  .  iceberg  right ahead   the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean . the screams of the doomed after she went down . and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears .  br    br   the music  which has also been a victim of the film  s success  was a key ingredient . james horner  s score was simply perfect . and the love theme was beautiful and tragic . too bad celine dion  s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many .  br    br   i confess  i am a titanic buff . as such  i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it   in all its beauty . perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i  ve had such an interest in the ship all my life . however  i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs . i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy . the film was made with such humanity .  br    br   another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic  and you will not be disappointed .

71 ===> masters of horror the screwfly solution starts as america is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population  when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of god . scientist alan  jasn priestley  is brought in by the government  knows more than most  senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife anne  kerry norton  to take their teenage daughter amy  brenna o  brien   try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them . . .  br    br   this canadian american co  production was episode  from season  of the masters of horrror tv series  directed by joe dante i thought the screwfly solution was pretty bad . i personally think the script by sam hamm sucks  it takes itself far too seriously  i don  t really understand why it  s part of the masters of horror series  the horror that the filmmakers are going for in the screwfly solution is in the actual story itself  themes  ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it  s gets the chance during it  s short   odd minute running time which i felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up . i wasn  t happy with the inconsistencies with the story either  if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman  s neck on the plane  was he sexually aroused  i think not . why does every bloke then think he  s killing in the name of god  i just can  t see every single bloke on earth suddenly knowing the bible  starting to believe in god  i just found the notion ridiculous  the show also states clearly that there  s nothing religious about what  s going on so what  s the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see  then there  s the fact people get turned on by different things  what about gays for instance  will they kill guys instead of women  i know there  s a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it  s conveniently brushed to one side  then there  s the thing which annoyed me the most . the fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho  killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened  it just felt so stupid  the plotting is rubbish  to round things off there  s a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of the x  files            with a bright neon alien .  br    br   director dante on this showing definitely doesn  t qualify as a master of horror as far a i  m concerned  the story is badly paced  it  s just so stupid considering it  s played deadly straight  instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it  s deadly virus on the loose situation  the subsequent mother  daughter on the run because of it  there  s very little here in the way of what i would call effective horror  even less gore . there  s a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle  a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle  another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about .  br    br   technically like the other episodes it  s really good  it doesn  t have the look of a cheap tv series  the special effects are great as usual  it  s well made . the acting is alright but no  one really stood out .  br    br   the screwfly solution is easily the worst masters of horror episode i  ve seen but bear in mind i haven  t seen all of them . . . yet . as a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me  as a show made by a so  called master of horror it disappoints me even more .

72 ===> i love the frequently misnomered  masters of horror  series . horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment . projects like this  and the similar  greenlight project  with gave us  feast   like it or lump it  are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror .  br    br   this one began with a kernel of really  kool  idea and ran . . . right off the edge of  where in the world am i going with this      .  br    br   i don  t know how to spoil the spoiled but  spoiler ahead  all of a sudden . . . no  there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier . . . we have long haired luminescent aliens  huh  . . . huh   brain drilling males and . . . yeah  i get it but . . . well . . . the worst curse of storytelling  a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement .  br    br   cue to storytellers . . . your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up . not the other way around . storytelling math    .  br    br   end of spoilers  big oops

73 ===> after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted  urban  turn of the century australian street  we meet julie  rebecca gibney  and peter  john adam  as they go out house hunting . they manage to get a loan for a fixer  upper on a posh sydney street  but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home . it just may be haunted .  br    br     gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker .  br    br   the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget  but not wholly excusable to that hurdle . a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film . the opening  thriller scene  features some wonky editing . freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there  s not much action . suspense should be created from staging  not fancy  fix it in the mix  techniques . there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location  the lighting  the fog and such  but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim  cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street  showing their increasing proximity . the tracking and the cuts need to be slow . the attack needed to be longer  clearer and better blocked . as it stands  the scene has a strong  made for television  feel  and a low budget one at that .  br    br   after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves . the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror        though the budget forces a much subtler approach . millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios  often dramatic in nature instead of special effects  oriented  such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron  which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall .  br    br   for some horror fans  the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama . at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in . but morphett writes fine  intelligent dialogue . the material is done well enough that it  s often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later   especially if you  ve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house .  br    br   once they get settled and things begin to get weirder  even though the special effects often leave much to be desired  the ideas are good . the performances help create tension . there isn  t an abundance of death and destruction in the film   there  s more of an abundance of home repair nightmares . but neither menace is really the point .  br    br   the point is human relationships . there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting . the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it . that it  s in a posh neighborhood  and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies  shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe  such as money or health problems . peter  s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with  normal  work  based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive  scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful . at the same time  we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be . julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown  but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship .  br    br   although   gantry row never quite transcends its made  for  television clunkiness  as a tv movie  this is a pretty good one  with admirable ambitions . anyone fond of haunted house films  psycho films or horror  thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy . it certainly isn  t worth spending    for a dvd  that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it  factoring in shipping and handling    but it  s worth a rental  and it  s definitely worth watching for free .

74 ===> daniell steel  s daddy  what a refreshing story . this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children . how rare is that  in these times of  heather has two mommies   or what ever  you fill in the blanks  it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone . with the father  s roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga . how disappointing to have it end . every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role . i would have loved to see each character develop over the years . i loved this movie  it is one i will defiantly watch every time it  s on . good story  good acting  and i hope this isn  t a spoiler  but no obtrusive sex or bad language . yes it touched my heart . warning  get the kleenex ready . what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment  be it television or . movie  s . daniell if your listening  you go girl  give us more .  

=======================================================================================================

75 ===> a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante . their previous collaboration on the first season  s  homecoming  was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways . this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered . the supposed  payoff  showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing . if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial  cleaning  of the planet of it  s human infestation  why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion  why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king  s  the stand  instead of having the male population butcher the females  i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous . the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it . i like a lot of both dante and hamm  s work but this was just unwatchable .  

=======================================================================================================

76 ===> i gave this  stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned . from the domestic violence  to sexuality and many of the taboos therein . outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction .  br    br   it  s bleak  depressing and hopeless . while i don  t mind a less than cheery ending  i  m really very tired of the  humans suck  clich that  s central to every movie . i know you can  t get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self  hatred as a member of the human race  but how  s  bout as a writer  director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil  right now  if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die  just go out  find a lake and swim  til your arms are tired . this way you won  t be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive . it  s silly  not thoughtful  and boring .  

=======================================================================================================

77 ===> it  s heart  warming to see a movie that doesn  t bash males . in this one the wife  mother leaves her family to  get in touch  with herself  or pursue her libido . the father stays with and nurtures the kids  letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them .  

=======================================================================================================

78 ===> i must admit  when i read the description of the genre on netflix as  steamy romance  i was a little bit skeptical .  steamy   in a movie from       i was prepared for disappointment . and when i realized it was shot entirely in black  white  i knew my erotic hopes were dashed .  br    br   boy  was i wrong  not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance   the discovery of first love  fear of the secret being found out  a sudden unexpected end   but at times this movie was downright erotic . you will soon forget that it is shot in black  white . the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years . and the performances from the two stars  essy persson and anna gael  are intense and memorable . ok  so they  re both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls . it  s     . do you really expect teenagers from the    s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this  many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then . anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much .  br    br   i think this movie was way ahead of its time . the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination  opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown .  br    br   i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here . as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it won  t be all you expect  i don  t think you  ll be too  too disappointed .  

=======================================================================================================

79 ===> a little girl  s dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification . when it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other  it is assumed to be the body of a couple  s missing daughter . after this trauma  the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence . all of this changes when one day  many years later  she receives a phone call from her daughter  with the help of an ex  cop and a reporter  she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive .  los sin nombre  is a mess plot  wise  moves at an achingly slow pace  and is completely unscary . the saving grace is emma vilarasau  who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother . the best part of the movie is the ending  but i  m not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film . beware of the english subtitles on the recent r  release   they aren  t very accurate .  

=======================================================================================================

80 ===> i  m not alone in admiring the first superman movie  a film that richard donner executed masterfully . i am also not alone in scorning richard lester  s superman  . . . which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie  sadly it is still an absolute abomination .  br    br   superman  s world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses  but superman  stretches things too far . it doesn  t matter who directed superman  because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader . in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do  unlike the original superman . with or without his powers  superman  s strength  or lack thereof  is handled in the least believable manner . there is too much to criticize  so i will not bother . i condemn this movie . . . perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on . super  duper bad .  

=======================================================================================================

81 ===> it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact even by today  s standards  the film is interesting and provocative  br    br   therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl  s school therese is energetic  intelligent  and becomes a mentor for the innocent  naive  sweet isabelle she guides her through a number of exotic experiences  including a trip through an exclusive brothel  into her first lesbian liaison  and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience  br    br   the film does not exploit any sex  nor is there an abundance of nudity . . . the imagery is effective  but sometimes the camera lingers too long  and the story goes slowly  br    br   the director  radley metzger  went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris he always has extremely detailed stories  good acting  and very high standards of cinematography . . .  br    br   artistically  however  this is perhaps his most complete his later attempts supplied for entertainment  whereas  therese and isabelle  was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism . . .  

=======================================================================================================

82 ===> we watched this in my women  s health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies  and i absolutely loved this movie . i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch . the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone . i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed . this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating . this is a movie i will show to my children . the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women  but this movie was more than that . it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite .  

=======================================================================================================

83 ===> so . . . we get so see added footage of brando . . . interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff . susannah york was hardly a slouch . new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn  t notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets . real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that . . . let  s listen to donner make fun of lester  s version that made more logical sense . the president talks of the zod  defacing  the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore . tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd . superman  s  freedom of the press  line sounded silly compared to  . . care to step outside  which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark  s earlier scene in the truck stop . then there is the ending with the  turn back the world to go back in time  effect . it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack  n . j . ever went since it doesn  t free zod and company any more .  

=======================================================================================================

84 ===> superman ii  the richard donner cut should be a fan  s dream come true . at long last  footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life . a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored . it seems like a winning situation . and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this  esoteric dream  is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence . while it  s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project . and it is only a very few times .  br    br   you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics . but then we start seeing new footage  alternates from superman  the movie for the trial  and that first bit of hesitation fades away . hey  this is pretty neat  things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project  and it doesn  t convince at all . and from this point on  it never ever lets up . it  s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects  but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was  you  ll believe a man can fly  it  s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here . the best effects in this are from the original productions .  br    br   another issue with this re  cut . a lot of it just doesn  t make sense . the only reason any of it really works is because we  ve all seen the theatrical version of superman ii  a movie that does make sense . lester  s superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly . part of this could be because donner didn  t get to complete shooting  the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible . what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent .  br    br   after viewing this  one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material  michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester . the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii . that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence  not ironically  both were filmed by donner . but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re  edited in such a hasty fashion  that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing . while lester honored the donner material  lester here is thrown under the bus .  br    br   so is there anything good in this release  well marlon brando is in it  and that  s neat to see . in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman  the movie . but that only highlights the problems of this release . any of the major scenes  really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando  would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section . instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances  many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used  sloppy edits and bad decisions .  br    br   watch the opening scene at the daily planet . why are we looking at jackie cooper  s back as he calls for lois and clark  at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on  i was initially confused by this  because i expected to see lois . the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this .  br    br   battle scenes are a mess too  with no geography between cuts . it  s just random action . of course  the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates . they should have used more of lester  s footage  but probably had too much pride to admit that .  br    br   the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well . as noted elsewhere  the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation  xk    while we all know it  s the  xk      a blind man in stm knows that  the producers of this assembly  who tried so hard to honor the original film  dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production . for all the supposed care that was put into this  the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable .  br    br   the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner  s didn  t make this a separate release here in the states . as it is  we  re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a  play all  option . it  s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes  but after that initial viewing  i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else . i know after my experience of watching this  i had new respect for lester  s version . it  s by no means perfect  but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief . he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so  while this new re  cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history .

85 ===> i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his  her reluctant guardian . i  ve seen enough of them  baby boom  kolya  about a boy  mostly martha  and to some extent  whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula . what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small  town china in the      s . extreme poverty was the norm  and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market . when wang discovers his purchased grandson  whom he  s nicknamed  doggie   is a granddaughter  he initially casts her out  even though she  s showed great promise as street  performing heir . even after he reluctantly takes her back  he  s not too upset when she  s kidnapped . the film is gritty then  showing the lengths to which a young  street  smart girl had to go to survive in that society .  br    br   the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context . in a western society  one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success . wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status  though  that i did  too . while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern  suburban child  it  s completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage . and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her  her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense .  br    br   the peek at small  town life in a foreign country  the naturalness of the two lead actors  the surprising plot twists  and of course  the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film .  

=======================================================================================================

86 ===> this movie is the best film ever . i can  t remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me . with a tear in my eye  i admire this movie . it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues  music  acting  story  plot . a story of friendship  courage  kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar . little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson . they were not conventional in real . every scene they were together was priceless . the camera work is flawless and grips you . the acting is inspired . xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks . renying zhou  doggie  looks pretty and played her character very well . zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great . he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well . if you have  t this movie  try it once  do watch it .

87 ===> i was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in north carolina . instead i watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the duke family . and this went on and on . if mr . mcelwee  s family had prevailed over the dukes i doubt that mr . mcelwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco  related diseases . i grew up near the area where mr . mcelwee  s family began it tobacco business  i expected more than mcewee  s continual focus on his family . i learned very little about the history of tobacco in the nc economy and the ramifications to the state  s economy by tighter regulation of tobacco . the countless references to the movie  bright leaves  are out of place  so what if gary cooper played mr . mcelwee  s great grandfather  does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the north carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film  i didn  t .

88 ===> when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don  t care what the movie is  edison started really good with some good effort from the singers  who  want  to  be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but . . .  in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience  done  a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action  done  and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie . . .  when you see   elite police officers  packed with weapons that can demolish a building  shoot at a guy behind a car  fail to hit him even once while he kills all  but   and then the guy takes out a flame thrower  to kill the rest    you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this

89 ===> wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a  king of masks  for his mastery of sichuan change art . liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person . liang is worried that a precious art shouldn  t die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wang  s mind . the film is about prejudices  male domination  state of art  values and most importantly warmth .  br    br   i can  t recommend this film enough . the whole film is in loops . everything has a significance . its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just   minutes . a total satisfaction . for five minutes it is an artistic film  next five minutes its a sad film  next five minutes its a thriller . it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face . last scene on the rope is phenomenal . story and script is flawless . actors are brilliant . both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed . very impressive . it was not even nominated for oscars . that year  english patient  got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category  kolya  won .  kolya  was just ok and about  english patient  the lesser said the better . watch it     .  

=======================================================================================================

90 ===> one of the most heart  warming foreign films i  ve ever seen .  br    br   the young girl is an amazing talent . stellar performances by her  doggie   the old man  the king of masks   and liang  the living boddhisatva  .  br    br    spoiler  the deplorable treatment of children  especially females is disturbing .  br    br   loved the music . the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story .  br    br   this is a must see   enjoyable family film  although not for very young children . would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version .  

=======================================================================================================

91 ===>   the curse of frankenstein  sticks faithfully to mary shelley  s story for one word of the title  which wouldn  t be so bad if the changes were any good at all . the tragedy of the creature destroying frankenstein  s family has been completely excised and replaced with . . . nothing . the heart and moral centre of the story is gone . it doesn  t help that this frankenstein is a conniving  devious murderer he deserves everything he gets . the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clichs . even taken on its own terms  this is rubbish a bland  rambling film featuring a shite  looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . as it  s the first of hammer  s horror films  directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee  its place in horror history is secure . but it  s crap .  

=======================================================================================================

92 ===> nintendo    you ers    how could you do this to me  i can  t believe it . . . this movie is actually worse than the first one . i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along . . . . oh god . . . where do i even begin  the plot sucked . the voice acting sucked . the animation sucked . the ending really sucked . if you liked this movie  you suck too . and to futuramafan      who said this was the greatest movie ever  you are a tool  plain and simple . this isn  t a movie for anyone but crack  addled ten  year olds with game boys who think pikachu is god . i  m still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie . . . . and then there was pikachu  s adventure . . . don  t even get me started on that horrible mess of a film . it is  in all truth  one of the most boring experiences of my entire life . don  t go watch this at any costs .  br    br   bottom line go out  find every copy of this movie that you can  and burn it . burn them all  and then proceed to rent a good movie  like aliens . . . or bowling for columbine . . . or even back to the future   

=======================================================================================================

93 ===> the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic . i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the      s chinese  mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions  i felt i could get a real sense of the times  recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living . it seemed worthwhile to experience . the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true  to  form  both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect  perhaps the most effective that i  ve seen in chinese film . casting is great . images are memorable . acting is solid enough . thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression .  

=======================================================================================================

94 ===> the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship . set in     s china during a time of floods  we meet wang  an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him . when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang  he invites wang to join their troupe . however  we learn that wang  s family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son . learning that wang is childless  wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever . taking the advice to heart  wang purchases an  year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son  doggie  the ancient art of silk masks . soon  wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art .  br    br   together  wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it . the story is absorbing . the setting is serene and the costuming simple . summarily  it is an international award winning art film which can  t help but to move and inspire .  

=======================================================================================================

95 ===> pokemon the movie was a terrible film . unlike the first one  this is not a good film at all . the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it . in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent . the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad . tracey really doesn  t have much to say or do  and unlike brock offers no comic relief . the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash  and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining . overall this film isn  t worth renting and the short movie before didn  t do anything for me or my wife . and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans . oh well  maybe the next one will be better . cant ge t much worse  

=======================================================================================================

96 ===> much worse than the original . it was actually painful to sit through  and it barely held my six year old  s interest .  br    br   introduction of some new pokemon is marginally interesting  but storyline is extra  thin  dialogue is still bad  and music is mediocre . watch the television show instead  it  s much better .  

=======================================================================================================

97 ===> king of masks  bian lian in china  is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film . winner of   awards from around the world  this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian  a street performer in     s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face  change opera . he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance  and no one knows how he does it . he has a longing desire to have a grandson  as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir . we then go to the streets  and see that people are selling their children because they can  t afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free  because daughters are not worth much in this society . wang bianlian  s story goes on from there .  br    br   the film was so astonishingly good  the acting was amazing  and the issues were so weighty and well  addressed . there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place  no one wants a little girl . also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman  and while he is famous and well  respected  he regards himself as something low  a half woman . as we go further into the film  the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it  the brutality and corruption of the military and police  and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions .  br    br   this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life  and xu zhu  the actor who plays wang bianlian  presents yet another beautiful performance .  

=======================================================================================================

98 ===> this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense . this is a wonderful film   deeply moving without being sentimental . highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

99 ===> i figured that it  s about time i let this one out . pokmon fans are suffering in america these days . why  because we rely on kids wb and  kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies . as far as the series goes  they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television . so what is their problem when it comes to the movies  honestly now  i have seen all three pokmon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one . they are excellent movies . they are all enjoyable and fun to watch . and  after seeing pokmon     in theaters  i can  t help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts . the way it appears  it seems that they read and see something that says insert empty moral here  in big bold faced letters . it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb  extreme sarcasm there  and created this crap .  br    br   possible spoilers from here on  br    br   well  i guess i should first talk about pikachu  s rescue adventure . my first gripe with this came with no narration . i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokdex narration that plagued pikachu  s vacation  and  instead of going with a caring  gentle woman  s voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai  they just cut the narration all together . this wouldn  t have been a problem  except for one thing . did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn  t let togepi go until the end  possibly the fans  but i  m sure not the parents . then  there  s the theme song . i couldn  t help but roll my eyes at this one . the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou  and was sung by japanese children . it was fun and enjoyable . this one nauseating . now  one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana . nice music  fun to watch . that  s changed with the bellossom . the music sucked for one  but on top of that  they had all the pokmon talk during the music  which turned out to be jumpy  annoying  and just unnecessary . oh  and then there  s the poliwhirl who thinks he  s a poliwrath . you  d think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are . basically  not much could save this little ill fated dub  which is very unfortunate considering its potential . but  i haven  t touched on the worst of it yet .  br    br   you  d think that the warning signs would  ve been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power . for some unfathomable reason  i had been placing some faith in  kids and the wb . my thoughts were well  they screwed up on the first movie  but the second is different as far as the theme goes  so they should do well .  that in mind  i just didn  t pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said  you will believe that one person can make all the difference .  with the way they said that at every turn  i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version . then comes nintendo power  in which i see all my fears realized in the words the main feature  the power of one .  at that point  i became a bit more uneasy . the power of one    not a good sign . however  i still kept some of my false faith . big mistake .  br    br   sitting in the theater  i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk . i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle . i can see a point in that since they didn  t pander this thing  repeating it over and over like in msb . however  it did more damage than anything else in this movie . first of all  the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to ash .  ah hah . so  ash is the chosen one  whatever . in the japanese version  the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokmon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony . this time  he  s the chosen one . a greater way that this did damage was to lugia . lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokmon movie . . . . when the movie was about lugia . in this one  lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash . in the scene where they  re flying back to the main island  lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia  s existence  not that ash is going to make all the difference . overall in this category  ash wasn  t really the one person  that would make the difference  since he was helped by many along the way .  br    br   a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking . furura  s flute song wasn  t nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one . jirarudan  s speech to them saying his collection started with a mew card   ugh . even worse  misty  s outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held . why didn  t you put them in pokballs when you caught them  this is like caging them to be displayed .  much different from whining about him thinking pokmon are things to be collected like stamps . if there were any real redeeming values in this  they came from team rocket . some pretty funny lines . not really to make me laugh out loud  but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach . well  that was officially the last american pokmon movie i  m going to see . i  ve imported the third one and find it very enjoyable . i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two . i  ll be importing the fourth one as well . forget you  kids wb and  kids . you have forsaken me for the last time .

100 ===> a cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief  s daughter  leading to much hate and violence .  br    br   this crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at  though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level . the terrible costumes and the fact that all the indians are obviously white  makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it  s press materials pretends it to be .  br    br   in short  the plentiful nudity  the real reason for watching this  is good . everything else is not . there  s definitely better examples of both genres .  br    br   more interesting is that the ramrodder was filmed at the infamous spahn movie ranch and features not one  but two members of the manson family  catherine share and bobby beausoleil  who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda  stained screens of the pussycat theater   

=======================================================================================================

101 ===> this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone  but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation . women and performers  both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star  are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china . this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture .  br    br   the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors  performance .  br    br   a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies .  

=======================================================================================================

102 ===> robert a . heinlein  s classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years  in everything to paul verhoeven  s     film to a tv series  to a number of games . but none of these  so to speak  has really captured the spirit of his novel . the games are usually unrelated  the tv series was more of a spin off  and the less said about verhoeven  s film  the better . little do most know  however  that in japan  an animated adaptation had already been done  released the year of heinlein  s death . and  believe it or not  despite its differences  this   part animated series is  plot  wise  the most faithful adaptation of heinlein  s classic .  br    br   the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons  something we were deprived of in verhoeven  s film . like the book  the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel  though we see a fair amount of each . while events happen differently than in the book  the feel of the book  s plot is present . rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement  but it  s only slightly more touched upon than in the book . while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book  it gets a bit of the anime treatment  but what did you expect    but it  s far superior to the film . heinlein  s political views are merely excised  as opposed to the film  where they are reversed . the big payoff of the series  however  is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs  aliens  which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version .  br    br   overall  i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein . and i think they did pretty well with this . if you can find this series  give it a look .

103 ===> ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names . i mean great actors like  the freeman aka morgan freeman  an asset to hollywood  however completely wasted in this film . then we got kevin spacey  who i  ve been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects . both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story . then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake . i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven  t hit him yet . well the reason for that  i might add  is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review . the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first   minutes of it . the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone . they got the one liners and sound  bite worthy stuff . the token troubled black guy  ll cool j  who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life . the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone . and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience . oh and lots of gun fire  i mean a whole lot . spoiler  not     the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who  s crooked dead and the hero prevails . they got flame throwers and rocket launchers  really no kidding .  br    br   bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors  or a great fan of justin timberlake  to all the   year old girls out there  enjoy   i wish i had more hands  because then i would have more thumbs  because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening .  br    br   may gd have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies . well it could be worst  another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher  hehe check out in the mix lol  or even get rich or die trying  . now the special thing about that movie is that its got    year old men  playing   or even younger teens . i could go on with these .

104 ===> roy rogers stars as jesse james and his look  alike  gambler man clint burns . george  gabby  hayes is mr . rogers  s ex  pal  sheriff gabby . gale storm  jane fillmore  and sally payne  polly morgan  are a noteworthy team  as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero .  br    br   of course  mistaken identity  impersonation is a plot development  since rogers essays a  dual role  . rogers is charming  as usual but  there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary  any potential to deliver a memorable jekyll  hyde performance is done in by poor material . the better pair to watch are ms . storm and ms . paye as the st . louis journal reporters  they are the film  s highlight . the songs are fine  though badly synched .  br    br    jesse james at bay       joseph kane  roy rogers  george  gabby  hayes  gale storm

105 ===> when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir  the aging and very proud street performer  known to all as  the king of masks   becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate .  br    br   his warmth and humanity  tho  find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china  s devastating natural disasters  in this case  massive flooding in the      s .  br    br   he takes his new   year old companion  onto his straw houseboat  to live with his prized and beautiful monkey   general   only to discover that the he  child is a she  child .  br    br   his life is instantly transformed  as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man .  br    br   there are many stories inside this one . . . many people are touched  and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe . thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama  and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye .  br    br   the technical transfer itself is not that great  as i found the sound levels all over the meter  and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie . highly recommended        stars .  

=======================================================================================================

106 ===> an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film .  br    br   shameful since it warrants having a wider audience .  br    br   a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told  although admittedly predictable in its resolution . solidly acted by the principals . beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film .  br    br   my recent foray into chinese film  shower  the road home  not one less  has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring . china and its people is an amazing canvas for film  makers .  the king of masks  can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film .  br    br

107 ===> unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid  euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie . my points  br    br   film is based on  things  br    br     ethnical point of view as it happens on most of the american films  the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning  or  things about the asian culture . but unfortunately it is not enough . knowing kunefe and  names of other foods doesn  t make a person understand a culture . for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that . lebanese people are christian  ok they got that  and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries . the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don  t make ethnocentrism . so we don  t judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film .  br    br     sexual revolution of a girl there is nothing much to say about this . show me   girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong .  br    br   i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre . please watch dr . strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor . a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it . where is the truth  where is the meaning about the movie .

108 ===> hollywood  s misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits . for every  godfather ii   there are dozens of  more american graffiti  s    stayin  alives   and  grease   s .  while the original  grease  is not a great film  the     adaptation of the long  running broadway hit does have songs evocative of the      s  energetic choreography  and an appealing cast . when paramount began work on a follow  up  the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster .  br    br   fortunately for moviegoers  michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts . her talent and beauty were already evident herein  and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform . maxwell caulfield  however  lacks even the skill to express embarrassment  and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic . what romantic interest  beyond hormones  could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan caulfield  that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory . only cameos by veterans such as eve arden  connie stevens  and sid caesar have any wit  although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame material .  br    br   reviewers have complained that  because  grease   is always compared to the original  the movie comes up lacking . however  even taken on its own terms  the film is a clunker . after a frenetic opening number  which evidently exhausted the entire cast  the energy dissipates . with few exceptions  the original songs bear little resemblance to the early      s  and the only nostalgia evoked is for  our miss brooks  and  sid caesar  s comedy hour .  the jokes fall flat  and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia birch is clumsy to be polite . however  worse films have been inflicted on audiences  and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters . unfortunately   grease   is not even unintentionally funny . instead  the film holds the viewer  s attention like a bad train wreck . just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered  the next scene plunges into even worse carnage .

110 ===>   masks  is a moving film that works on many levels . at its simplest  it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art  masks  to the next generation . although  at times the story makes the old man into a job  it is so well crafted  written  acted  directed  wonderful production values   it is easy to move beyond his plight . and  if you hang with it  the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting . kudos all around . this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults . the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it

111 ===> i  m sorry  but even tj hooker  s adrian zmed couldn  t save this sequel . i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original . then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene  notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs   and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious . i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang  having lost their  wheels  due to their gambling habits in the original grease  were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie . being shamed by that putz character carrington  i  d hate to see what they would resort to later maybe mopeds   br    br   i also never bought the hackneyed theme hunky  australian  boy  can  t  fit  into  outsiders  dominated  school  ergo  goes  for  tough  guy  with  stupid  biker  helmet  look . it was disney story gone horribly awry .  br    br   so  it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble  gum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical . the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it .  

=======================================================================================================

112 ===> the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student . although in the previous film olivia newton st . john  s foreign speech pattern is not explained  it  s explained here caulfield is her cousin . what  s conn still doing in school  i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she  s a beautician .  br    br   caulfield  s a smart kid  so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd . and that  s especially bad when zmed  s girl friend decides she likes caulfield . but being a nerd just isn  t going to cut it .  br    br   that  s when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act . he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride . he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face . if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards  caulfield won  t have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he  s outfitted .  br    br   grease  introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed . if you saw the first grease film  a much better film  than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out .  br    br   in addition to conn  eve arden  sid caesar  and dody goodman  all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles . the music score isn  t remotely as good as the songs that come from the original .  br    br   it  s not that grease  is bad  it  s just not all that great .  

=======================================================================================================

113 ===> this is probably my favorite movie of all time . it is perfection in its storytelling . it will break your heart not because it  s over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through . you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time .  

=======================================================================================================

114 ===> it  s a tale that could have taken place anywhere really  given the right circumstances . street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing . the aging entertainer finds  buys a male child to pass his art to . from there  we follow them through the rigors of their challenging  but free life along the river . traveling town to town  he performs and has some degree of notoriety . despite the times and the influences  the man is kind and good .  br    br   overall  the performances are first rate  especially xu zhu  who portrays the street performer . the child  renying zhou  is beautiful  and downright strong  and withstands the overt prejudices well . the two protagonists  along with supporting help from the kind opera singer  master liang  an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang   paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness  sadness and love . some have mentioned this film  s remote similarities to ba wang bie ji  farewell my concubine   yet this film can  t stand easily on its own  any resemblance is remote at best .  br    br   my only qualm with the king of masks  is the ending . it was weak  cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer . the audience was already wrapped up in the story  what was the needless manipulation for  what a shame . to bring a fine motion picture that far  only to surrender to emotional  and corny  pathos like that . it frankly made this film good  instead of the classic  it should  ve been . that aside  the king of masks is still very well worth your time . i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films . highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

115 ===> boy  girl love affair  sequel with songs  only this time she  s the punkette and he  s the straight arrow . movie  buffs out there actually like this movie  it has fans  i must say  the mind reels . . .  grease   is a truly lame enterprise that doesn  t even have the courage  moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames  like  jaws   or  exorcist ii   . no  it whimpers along in slow  motion and often just plays dead . it looks and feels cheap  with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling . this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and  although she doesn  t embarrass herself  it  s a role worth forgetting . a misfire on the lowest of levels . no stars from   

=======================================================================================================

116 ===> when i was    grease  was like crack . it was a classless  shameful  euphoric  and powerfully addictive experience . my sister and i would watch it  rewind it  and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another . so  if you are an    year old girl  and you reviewed this film as  brilliant  or  fun  or  better than the original grease   you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass .  br    br   if  however  you are not a little girl  you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease  was anything but an inane  artless  slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production  distribution  and  or consumption .  br    br   for the sake of criticism  i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows  br    br    . in a well  executed musical  the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters . in grease   with a few debatable exceptions  to the music is obscenely pointless . most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way   score tonight    reproduction    do it for our country   and  prowlin    without making one concrete statement about any of the film  s characters or themes . plus  all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance .  br    br    . the t  birds should be badass  and if not at least somewhat likable  but instead each of them is an annoying wussy  dufus  loser . in the end  when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t  bird jacket and initiates him into the gang  michael should kick it to the ground  spit on it  and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it . but of course  he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads  there is no greater honor than to be one with the t  birds .  br    br    . since michael is beautiful  smart  kind  resourceful  and above average in everyway  his musical impotence notwithstanding   it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask . stephanie  on the other hand  is a slovenly  slack  jawed  bubble gum smacking  dirty sweatshirt wearing  gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat . so aside from being pretty  i guess   she harbors no likable characteristics  thus  audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael  s attraction to her .  br    br   i could go on and on  but i didn  t want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair . i will say this though  to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time  s sake grease  is an experience akin to re  living your first kiss . only you are   now and kissing a snot  nosed    year old kid with acne and slobby braces . the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed . trust me .

117 ===> ok  let  s get this clear . i  m really not into sci  fi  but for some reason i love stargate sg   .  br    br   jack o  neil takes his team sg   through a stargate . a round device that creates a wormhole . it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds . it might sound like your usual sci  fi  series  but it  s not  the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci  fi  series . i find that great . it gives you things  happenings and such you can relate to  and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets . they have some of course but thanks to o  neil who likes to keep a simple terminology  there  s not many .  br    br   the series has a nice blending of action  humor and drama . if you enjoy loads of special effects you  re not going to find it here . they don  t use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects .  

=======================================================================================================

118 ===> in the rapid economic development of      s in china  there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture  partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth  and more importantly  due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural  revolutionary era .  br    br   however  the resurgence of chinese traditional culture  namely  the confucianism  was not without disasters  because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part  and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example .  br    br   moreover  not only the part that should be discarded were inherited  the good part that was supposed to be inherited  such as the traditional opera  and its technique  such as changing face  was ignored in the resurgence  and facing extinction .  br    br   the director used this film to criticize the problem of re  embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie .  

=======================================================================================================

119 ===> i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love . it  s not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime . everything  s pretty restrained and you don  t really get an idea of who these characters are so  as a viewer  i wasn  t able to become emotionally invested in the storyline . i guess i  m not the target audience for this but i  m not sure who is . everything  s muted and soft focus and earth tones . . . nothing  s very interesting . i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it  s handled so discreetly that i was disappointed . rent personal best instead .  

=======================================================================================================

120 ===> i  ve read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained . this movie is nothing . it  s so badly written  directed and acted that it barely makes an impression . the characters speak in cliche  ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible . while that might make this campy and fun  it doesn  t because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull . it  s as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn  t allowed by studio execs to give the story some true  to  life gusto or didn  t have the cojones . this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard  issue bad lifetime tv movie .  

=======================================================================================================

121 ===> the movie is truly poignant  unique and uplifting . the story is universal in that it  s a battle between good  evil and the world between . the most important thing is that its rating is wrong  misleading  and a travesty . blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie . the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub  titles .  

=======================================================================================================

122 ===> the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted  to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists . . . . . . and rightly so . this deserves a lot better treatment .  br    br   the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft  the rules of the day  and winds up with a little girl instead  not the conventional way  . . . . and the problems that ensue afterward . the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy  which he obviously thought was the case .  br    br   the old man  bianlian wang  xu zhu  is kind of funny  looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin . the little girl  doggie   zhou renying  is a cutie . the rest of the story is how the two manage after that . i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final   minutes .  br    br   overall  it  s involving story complete with drama  suspense  humor and sadness . just don  t expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd . until it comes out on widescreen  rent it .  

=======================================================================================================

123 ===> they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love . the only thing worse is the film itself . the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital . at one point when the wife leaves the husband  a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack  no kidding . the actors try but are defeated by the inept  unbelievably terrible script . direction is staggeringly bad . no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation . how do things like this get made . i  m turning off the television before it  s over   

=======================================================================================================

124 ===> this movie was okay  but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are  born that way   especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman . it almost seems as if kate  s gender preferences turned on and off like a switch  making this film seem a little simplistic .  br    br   also  as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda  it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as  bigots .  and there was no happy medium . it was either kate  s friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her . this is not typical of interactions between gay and non  gay relatives and friends . it is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play . it is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make . sadly  the movie showed none of these types of interactions . for a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance  it struck me as very intolerant movie  then at the end  kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with mac and everything is hunky dory  is that what being gay is really all about  come on   

=======================================================================================================

125 ===> i just saw this movie today with my children  son    and daughter   .   at the  rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival . after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director  tian  ming wu . he  through a translator  told several stories about his life and the making of the film .  br    br   all tangents aside  both of my children really enjoyed this movie . of course  i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter  but much of the film is visually self  explanatory .  br    br   i won  t give anything away  but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than    of the hollywood crap  especially children  s films  out there .  br    br   cheers .  br    br   p . s . there is a  real   original king of masks who can  could do   masks at once . the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to  masks at a time  then they would cut and change to  new masks  .  

=======================================================================================================

126 ===> this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows . it  s full of cliches  and the liz taylor character is not believable . it has a marvelous set  some exotic location footage . it shows taylor at the height of her beauty . she looks stunning .  

=======================================================================================================

127 ===> i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager . but i wanted to see it again  because traci lords is now earning a living as a  serious actor  . what the hell was going on in the eighties  this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors . definitely a waste of money .  

=======================================================================================================

128 ===> this is probably the first entry in the  lance o  leary  nurse keat  detective series in subsequent o  leary films  he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee .  br    br   a group of relatives  all played by well  known character actors  gathers in an old house  on a rainy nite  of course   to speak to a wealthy relative  who goes into a coma .  br    br   while they wait for him to recover  all sorts of mysterious goings  on happen  including a couple of murders .  br    br   a creepy film worth seeing   

=======================================================================================================

129 ===> elephant walk       starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god  forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen  staying out in the midday sun and going berserk . well eventually they do  after the typhoid or cholera outbreak  of course  and much mayhem ensues . taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler  adventure flick . when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps . thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day . one of my favorite guilty pleasures . in color too   

=======================================================================================================

130 ===>  . . . or type on a computer keyboard  they  d probably give this eponymous film a rating of    .  after all  no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt . to the contrary  the master of elephant walk  john wiley  peter finch   complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms   no matter how menacing   without a permit from the government  and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability  . furthermore  the elements conspire   in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic   to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people  as the natives dub them  to close the story . if you happen to see the current release earth  you  ll detect the elephant people are faring less well today .  

=======================================================================================================

131 ===> german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he  s unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made .  br    br   lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium . this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best  worst of ew . i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set . the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it .  br    br   the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies . only someone who has lived in los angeles  where every auto mechanic  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face .  br    br   the main character  a villainous beat cop  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent . aside from being a serial killer  he is also the oldest beat cop in la . despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody  then drags them into his home  which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse   and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners  the lapd refuses to investigate  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment .  br    br   the sets are excruciatingly bad . the production designer  s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint  precinct     on a cardboard wall .  br    br   since the actors were obviously unpaid non  professionals   a sad assortment of european emigres  possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands   bimbos  mimbos  and desperate middle  aged women   and since little if any money was spent on sets  special efx  locations or other production value  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine  looking police uniforms . sadly  they couldn  t afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental .  br    br   more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him . one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he  s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies . the other fits right in  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated .  br    br   the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her . don  t ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered  just accept lommel  s logic and enjoy the absurd ride .  br    br   after much prolonged hand  clawing out of straw  covered roadside graves  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance . they look exactly as they did before death  maybe even prettier  with black glamor make  up generously airbrushed around their eyes . looking nothing like zombies  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway .  br    br   at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll  and injects large doses of cheesy euro  trash techno into the soundtrack . we  re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise . stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty .  br    br   unlike other zombies  lommel  s girls speak and function as normal . . . er  i mean  as they did before becoming zombified . this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog . yes  a golden shower it is .  br    br   i won  t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending . all i can say is it  s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece . the spirit of ed wood lives on . . . or should i say his geist .  

=======================================================================================================

132 ===> the plot of  edison  was decent  but one actor in particular ruined the entire film . justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie . he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen  and should face the same fate as the entire f . r . a . t . squad .  br    br   whether it was an emotional scene  an action scene  or even a silent scene  justin timberlake managed to ruin it .  br    br   do not waste your time watching this film . don  t even bother downloading it  midget porn would be a much better choice .  br    br   and justin  if you  re reading this  stick to music . even though you  re no good at that  you  ve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing .  

=======================================================================================================

133 ===> i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue  but was pleased to find a fast  paced script  an underlying moral  excellent portrayals from all the actors  especially peter finch  amazing special effects  suspense  and beautiful cinematography   there  s even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban . not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic  before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work . all the supporting players round it out  and i do wonder who trained all those elephants .  br    br   speaking of the stone  buddha sequence  you really can discern that it  s vivien leigh in the long shots . her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor  s . the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots  where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk .  br    br   if you want a thought  provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring  spend a few hours with elephant walk .  

=======================================================================================================

134 ===> i watched  elephant walk  for the first time in about   years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior  rebecca .  as others have said  you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor  only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger  than  life yet deeply flawed relative . you have the stern and disapproving servant  a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart  climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead .  br    br   meanwhile   elephant walk  also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to  the letter   the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation .  br    br   maltin gives  elephant walk  just two stars  and imdb readers aren  t much kinder  but i enjoyed it despite its predictability . elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier  and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father . dana andrews   a favorite in  laura  and  the best year of our lives    is wasted as elizabeth  s frustrated admirer . the real star is the bungalow  one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history .  

=======================================================================================================

135 ===> i cannot believe that this movie was ever created . i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse . the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup . the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes . finally  there are maybe five or six zombies total  definitely not a nation . the best part of the movie  if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished . again to reiterate other user comments  the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie . also  there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all . it is never explained .  

=======================================================================================================

136 ===> seriously crappy movie .  br    br   first off  the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse  furniture store . the  bad  cop takes a girl  which they had pulled over  into the warehouse  s attic  while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there . the  bad  cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag  and the newbie cop doesn  t think there are any problems  but he still wonders what was in the bag  so he asks  gets a bullshit response  and then he thinks everything is ok  for now  .  br    br   the  bad  cop repeats this process  and even once with a tit scene  made it slightly better  . but eventually people start to catch on  which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was . one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies  like ya do . now  the  bad  cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch  and then he gets rid of the duffel  bagged body .  br    br   since she had the oogey  boogey magic put on her  she comes back with lots of eye  shadow on  which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie . . . also  the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become  eye  shadow monsters  . some of the girls meet up with a dude  who is apparently a currency specialist  and he offers them a ride  they look normal to him apparently  . but when the girls see other people  such as the one girls husband  he freaks out because she is hideous  some people freak out  but others don  t even notice  . . . . massive plot hole .  br    br   so  to wrap it up  the eye  shadow monsters kill the  bad  cop  who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene . it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel  like anyone would want to see part  of this cow dropping .  

=======================================================================================================

137 ===> a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon . although based upon the book by robert standish  this initial set  up is highly reminiscent of hitchock  s  rebecca   with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and  almost immediately  her own husband  who is still under the thumb of his deceased  but  dominant father . taylor  a last  minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh  looks creamy  smooth in her high fashion wardrobe  and her performance is quite strong however  once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her  one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic  this feeling hampers the ending as well  . still  the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama  a bit of travelogue  interpretive dance  an elephant stampede  and a perfectly  timed outbreak of cholera   from

138 ===> elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film  but it is great entertainment in the quasi  melodramatic mode . it is the story of love  both genuine and illicit  as well as overweening ambition  devotion  and the arrogance of personal tyranny . a previous reviewer  john mankin  questions why the central focus of the film  the mansion called elephant walk  should have been built by the former owner  the  governor  the late tom wiley  right across the elephants  traditional path to the major source of water  the river . to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man . that his son  played by peter finch  should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father  is not unexpected  since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father  s rowdy  boys  club  as his role models . the point of the father was that he was a self  made man who would tame nature to his liking  and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated  but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd  and thus he would dominate his son and all around him  and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water . who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water  this is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love  ceylon  today  s sri lanka  is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story  not just the expenses of miss taylor . were it not for this exotic location  much of the film was shot in ceylon   and the magnificent  bungalow  this would have been just another potboiler . one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place  as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant  conquerors  that were part and parcel of the british raj . it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony  teak  and marble . not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees  grille work window and doorway borders  evidently specified by art directors j . mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island . such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought .  br    br   for those immune to the blandishments of time  place  and architecture  there is always the allure of miss taylor  as she marries a man she doesn  t really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man  against the background described  and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased . as i said  it is not great literature nor even great film  but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today .  br    br   this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive  in  not on the home tv  so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera  work and scope .

139 ===> mt little sister and i are self  proclaimed horror movie buffs . we have seen just about everything  especially zombie flicks . now  we have seen a lot of good zombie movies  and a lot of bad ones . this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . not only was the acting horrible  but the special effects  graphics and ever  zombie  make  up was the worst i have seen . if you can even call it make  up  black eye shadow around the eyes  this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it  s cover . cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about . do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie                   i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying  this movie sucks  don  t waste your time  return now  hahahhaa i don  t want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie  i don  t even know how it got the ratings that it did  t should be in the negative  

=======================================================================================================

140 ===> someone actually gave this movie  stars . there  s a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn  t spend   seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary .  br    br   this film is . . . well . . . i guess it  s pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn  snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits  apart from the acting  plot  story  sets  dialogue and sound  . i wrongly assumed it was about zombies .  br    br   watching it is actually quite scary in fairness you  re terrified someone will come over and you  ll never be able to describe what it is and they  ll go away thinking you  re a freak that watches home  made amateur torture videos or something along those lines .  br    br   i  m so taken aback i  m writing this review on my mobile so i don  t forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current  .  to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered .  br    br   i worst film i  ve ever seen and i can say  with hand on heart  it will never  never be topped .

141 ===> robert standish  s novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation . . . so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle  s film . . .  br    br   the story is about a rich powerful planter  peter finch   who brings a charming and tender beauty  elizabeth taylor   into the jungle as his bride . . . the plantation  of course  is endangered by some kind of wild life . . . for this reason taylor  elegant as never in dazzling costumes  finds herself in a strange atmosphere . . . the echo determination of a ghost  the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father  a highly dangerous disease  and the fury of wild animals . . .  br    br   in her confusion  boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face  a pretentious foreman  dana andrews   who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love . . .  br    br   with echoes of  jane eyre   the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master  and  rebecca   the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife   elephant walk  is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow  exotic dances with rage excessively colorful  stampeding big bull elephants  amazing mansion set on fire  all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent . . .  br    br   the movie gave liz a change of scenery  and allowed her more creative energy and self  respect than most of her other willful debutante  rebels the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will  and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for

142 ===> one of the first ova  s   original video animation   i ever bought  this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles . a cyberpunk sci  fi action comedy set against an unlikely  for a comedy  that is  background of near  future pollution in a dystopian society .  br    br   the  heroes  of dominion are the tank police  formed with a  if we can  t beat crime  we  ll get bigger guns  philosophy  and who are  like the name suggests  patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars  and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch . most  if not all  of these cops are borderline    psychopaths and neurotics  giving new meaning to the phrase  loose cannons  .  br    br   equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries  terrorist buaku and his hench  wo  men  the twin cat sisters  whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time .  br    br   the animation is not state of the art  but it  s very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion .  br    br   the english dubbing is  again  lots of fun . the soundtrack of the english version is also very good . i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that . . .  br    br   anyway  dominion tank police is great . it  s japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy  filled with completely over  the  top characters and situations  making sure that it never takes itself seriously . highly recommended .

143 ===> i stopped by bb and picked up  zombie flicks to watch over the weekend . now  i understand that the effects will be cheesy  the acting will be sub  par  and the sets will be suspect . so i  m not expecting much . but it should at least have a story . stories don  t cost a thing except time . . . . . apparently  they didn  t have any time either .  br    br    zombie nation  had  zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers . the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie . it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre .  br    br   the running time is only   minutes but it felt like  hours . according to my wife  who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room   it sounded like zombie porn . . . . which if you think about  sounds kinda gross . . . . . but it wasn  t even that good .  br    br   the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess .  br    br   it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off . i rated it a  out of   because imdb won  t allow me to use decimals .  

=======================================================================================================

144 ===> not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts .  br    br   makeup that a child can do . acting was over done . . . poor directing . editing was very choppy . . . many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous . sound was badly dubbed . music was highly inappropriate . casting was extremely off . . . must have been on crack . zombies that talk let alone . . . drive  dance  work . . . just pisses me off . and the bad guy . . . holy crap  as horribly casted as he was . . . he was the best looking zombie of all . which doesn  t say much .  br    br   the cover art was good but very deceiving . . . as was the main menu of the dvd . . . great artwork and music .  br    br   don  t bother

145 ===> the anime that got me hooked on anime . . .  br    br   set in the year      hey  that  s not too far away now   the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence . seeing as how crimes are happening ever   seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists  the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem  cops with tanks  oh the insanity   br    br   the  heroes  of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki  a red haired japanese woman  yeah i know  they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance  who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond  blue eyed nice guy al . leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain  also known as  brenten    a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses  a big revolver and a bad temper . britain didn  t like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special  a giant green monster tank  doesn  t exactly endear her to him  nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini  tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare  where the boys are more your size  as he puts it . there  s also specs  the bifocal genius  bible quoting  god fearing chaplain  purple mo  hawked mohican  and the pot bellied chief  who  s right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics . seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them  they  re not very well liked by the people .  br    br   the  villains  are a cyborg named buaku who  s got a mysterious past that  s connected with a project known as  green peace   his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna  uni puma . in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven  t been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the  nd they  re hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku . the story  however  was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic   manga   book that  s very hard to find .  br    br   all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred . this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it  you  d better go get quentin tarantino . uneven in places but still a lot of fun .  br    br   followed by  new dominion tank police  .  

=======================================================================================================

146 ===> fact stargate sg   is a cheesy sci  fi tv series .  br    br   there  s no escaping facts . how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg   remains a cheesy sci  fi tv series .  br    br   stargate sg   does borrow and steal ideas briskly . special fx aren  t nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn  t going to blow you out of the chair . or couch for that matter either .  br    br   but  and this is where i really think stargate sg   deserves all the credit it can get  for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci  fi movie that  s actually worse than a one hour tv episode .  br    br   in fact some episodes actually could probably have been   minutes long and still have been better than most movies .  br    br   and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg   special .  br    br   i am very picky with my selections . i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught .  br    br   so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg   as yet another tacky sci  fi show  don  t . stick with it and you  ll see what i  m talking about .  

=======================================================================================================

147 ===>  review may contain some spoilers  i  ll make this review short and sweet . i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman . how bad could it be  right  well  it  s pretty bad . justin timberlake plays pollack  a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison  s police force . ll cool j is deed  a cop within the force on a special force team called f . r . a . t .  first response assault tactics  . he  s teamed with an  on  the  edge  bad cop named lazerov  dylan mcdermott  . in the opening scene we see lazerov  deed taking on some bank robbers  but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs . i don  t want to give to much away  but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs . pollack  who works for ashford  morgan freeman  goes to a trial involving deeds  lazerov . he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford  does some investigate that turns ugly . wallace  kevin spacey  who is all within the f . r . a . t . team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice .  br    br   you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey  s performance are pretty lackluster . the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott . he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me . ll cool j is terrible in this film . he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion . he was much better in movies like deep blue sea  any given sunday . the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film . the ending is far from satisfying .  br    br   don  t waste your time with this film . i  m putting it on ebay this weekend .  

=======================================================================================================

148 ===> ok its not the best film i  ve ever seen but at the same time i  ve been able to sit and watch it twice    story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way .  br    br   and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling .  br    br   overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it .  

=======================================================================================================

149 ===> i stumbled across this  act  i  by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago . this was  nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned . it amazed me . it intimidated me . it shocked me . i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later  i happened to think about it again . then went and bought both acts . they were even better than i had experienced at first .  br    br   my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime  warranting tanks and heavy artillery  it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals . that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time . if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda  it certainly has not been shown as such .  br    br   i don  t think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this . but regarding the story  there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused .  

=======================================================================================================

150 ===> dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making . the storyline across the  parts blends mindless action  slap  stick humor  touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions . it  s hard to believe that there was only one director  as the style changes from episode to episode . a must  see movie for anyone who likes anime .  

=======================================================================================================

151 ===> notice i have given this  star if the option been given i would have given this zero . as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest . i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake . but it didn  t prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen .  br    br   the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best . do not let that fool you . this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world .  br    br   the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it . the acting  if you can call it that   the  plot   so many holes must look like swiss cheese   and the special effects really are just terrible .  br    br   please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch .  br    br   in the end i  m not saying i can make a better movie than this  but i am thinking it .  

=======================================================================================================

152 ===> if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it  s this pile of crap . i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity . i actually began to feel angry watching this film because it  s so insultingly poor  i can  t believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable .  br    br   there  s no plot and the non  plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking . the people don  t react  act or in any way resemble human beings . the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be . the whole thing is one pointless mess  it doesn  t go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don  t do very much .  br    br   i could make a better film than this  so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before . it  s pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time .  br    br   honestly  the very worst movie of all time . you  ll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a      and urge you to buy the dvd . i can  t imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film  it  s terrible .  br    br       and that  s generous .  

=======================================================================================================

153 ===> i  ve spent years looking for a copy of this film    mm  dvd  vhs   so i could show it to my kids . the movie is funny  and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business . they had to be that good to play that demented . i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages .  br    br   the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse  with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band  when not fighting the fires  . there  s the usual running gags  plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra . also  comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight  man hugh o  brien .  

=======================================================================================================

154 ===> the performance by om puri  smita patil  and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely  along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani . the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great .  br    br   i have not seen another movie like this . it is one whole  each piece so nicely fit in the plot . you cannot not be impressed by this movie .  br    br   amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and  baap  of om puri . om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system . sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain . the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty  s at sadhashiv  s place is absoulely stunning . smita patil does not play a main role  but her part is also not distracting from the main plot .  br    br   and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings . saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble . he is also the  guru  of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble .  br    br   the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody . om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya .  br    br   a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema .  

=======================================================================================================

155 ===> i only watched the first   minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap . the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie . no  it was a hundred times worse . ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that  s not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever .  br    br   the american cop has a german accent  the  police station  was a desk in a warehouse with a sign  police station  hanging on the wall . there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet .  br    br   this cop pulls women over  cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse . he tells his cop partner to wait in the car . then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag . the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right  that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women  but he isn  t sure if that is what  s happening because  he  s a moron  the dialog is totally stupid  the acting is awful  and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen . it is totally obvious to the cop  s partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it  and yet  the partner  who is there all along  doesn  t know what is happening   br    br   the director of this film is a total hack . i stopped the movie at   minutes because i couldn  t take it anymore . it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won  t waste anymore time on it writing this review .  br    br   absolutely worthless .  

=======================================================================================================

156 ===> zombie nation     r  br    br   hey  i was bored . i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch . zombie nation  hey  i love zombie movies . says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description . funny how it doesn  t warn me not to watch this film . i could  ve used that advice .  br    br   zombie nation is just like troll  in that it  s completely misnamed . it has little  if anything  depending on your point of view  to do with zombies  and takes place all within one city . this film revolves around a crooked cop  who acts as badly as possible  he has to be trying to suck this much   while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them . yup  he  s a serial killer cop . not only is this film flawed in thinking that it  s a zombie flick  it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong . serial killers enjoy killing  they live for it and they get down and personal with it . this guy knocks out the women  and injects them with some poison . he doesn  t even have sex with the corpse or dismember it . talk about boring  eventually  one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason  all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy . they were all buried or tossed into the ocean  but you wouldn  t know it buy the sharp clean clothes they  re all wearing . the women then act very poorly and take their revenge . oh yay .  br    br   this film was crap in every category . crap acting  crap writing  crappier sets  and crappier make  up effects . the women don  t look zombie  like  unless you count really dark make  up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie . they can all talk  behave  think  and act perfectly human . the gore is weak compared to even many pg    films and the nudity is beyond brief . you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence . . . then the exact same breasts later  go figure . guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite . the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they  re obviously filming in . you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set  up and even  unless you are blind  you can see the director failing . steer clear  it  s a waste of time .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

157 ===> after  aakrosh   this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director . till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india . this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence . it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released . this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like  coolie    betaab    hero  in     .  br    br   smithapatel  in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him . she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs . at one time  she even gave up her love when the hero  s ruthlessness touched the roof top .  br    br   there was another character in this movie  which was played by om puri contemporary  naseeruddin shah . he played as an inspector  turned  alcoholic character . the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero  s ending .  br    br   in his debut film  sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare . the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent . the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani  s other film  drohkaal  . even after two decades  this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew . each one played their part par excellence .  

=======================================================================================================

158 ===>   ardh satya  is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema . directed by the great director govind nihalani  this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success . even today  ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india .  br    br   the film tells the real  life scenario of mumbai police of the   s . unlike any police of other cities in india  mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether . govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment .  br    br   amongst various police officers  colleagues  the film describes the story of anand velankar  a young hot  blooded cop coming from a poor family . his father is a harsh police constable . anand himself suffers from his father  s ideologies  incidences of his father  s atrocities on his mother . anand  s approach towards immediate action against crime  is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction . the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand  s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors . this leads to frustrations  as he cannot achieve the desired job  satisfaction . resulting from the frustrations  his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms  bars  also turning him to an alcoholic .  br    br   the spirit within him is still alive  as he constantly fights the system . he is aware of the system of the metro  where the police  politicians are a inertly associated by far end . his compromise towards unethical practice is negative . finally he gets suspended .  br    br   the direction is a master piece  thoroughly hard core . one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty  s house to arrest him  followed by short conversation which is fantastic . at many scenes  the film has hair  raising moments .  br    br   the practical approach of script is a major punch . alcoholism  corruption  political influence  courage  deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today . those aspects are dealt brilliantly .  br    br   finally  the films belongs to the one man show  om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly .

159 ===> last weekend i bought this  zombie movie  from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of  land of the dead  .  br    br   boy  was i wrong .  br    br   it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover  art  which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre .  br    br   we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell  phone . they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car  i couldn  t suspend my disbelief anymore .  br    br   some people actually consider this a  so bad  it  s good  movie  they are liars . i didn  t finish the movie  but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie  which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through .  br    br   this is even worse than  zombiez  do not watch

160 ===> german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he  s unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made .  br    br   lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium . this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best  worst of ew . i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set . the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it .  br    br   the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies . only someone who has lived in los angeles  where every auto mechanic  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face .  br    br   the main character  a villainous beat cop  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent . aside from being a serial killer  he is also the oldest beat cop in la . despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody  then drags them into his home  which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse   and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners  the lapd refuses to investigate  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment .  br    br   the sets are excruciatingly bad . the production designer  s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint  precinct     on a cardboard wall .  br    br   since the actors were obviously unpaid non  professionals   a sad assortment of european emigres  possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands   bimbos  mimbos  and desperate middle  aged women   and since little if any money was spent on sets  special efx  locations or other production value  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine  looking police uniforms . sadly  they couldn  t afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental .  br    br   more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him . one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he  s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies . the other fits right in  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated .  br    br   the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her . don  t ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered  just accept lommel  s logic and enjoy the absurd ride .  br    br   after much prolonged hand  clawing out of straw  covered roadside graves  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance . they look exactly as they did before death  maybe even prettier  with black glamor make  up generously airbrushed around their eyes . looking nothing like zombies  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway .  br    br   at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll  and injects large doses of cheesy euro  trash techno into the soundtrack . we  re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise . stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty .  br    br   unlike other zombies  lommel  s girls speak and function as normal . . . er  i mean  as they did before becoming zombified . this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog . yes  a golden shower it is .  br    br   i won  t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending . all i can say is it  s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece . the spirit of ed wood lives on . . . or should i say his geist .

161 ===> govind nihalani  s directorial venture of vijay tendulkar  s novel is brilliant . om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty  played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar . this is govind nihlan  s most talked about movie . this is a very good and a classic film . smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri . naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role . although sadashiv amrapurkar has only  scenes in the movie he dominates the movie . this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut . om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor . filmfare award winner for best film  story  supporting actor  sadashiv amrapurkar  .

162 ===> i love this show   br    br   every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is . i am a huge sci  fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science  fiction   show in the history of film  tv . there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion . its amazing  season after season the show gets better and better .  br    br   i  ve been a fan of macgyver since i was     now  and i find it so ironic that my  favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson . its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other .  br    br   back when i first saw stargate the movie  i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci  fi flicks  then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited  but didn  t get showtime till the fifth season was almost over .  br    br   though  i  m disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead .  br    br   id say though that it turned out just fine . maybe even better .  br    br   this show is amazing  and i hope it never dies . atlantis here we come

163 ===> i rented this movie last week . i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it  so it seemed promising . and it was  until justin timberlake came on scene . he is a really bad actor and shouldn  t be allowed to make a movie ever again . i mean  he is one of the most boring  uninspired actors i  ve ever seen . he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever . why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack  i think matt damon would have been a better choice .  br    br   kevin spacey was another big disappointment . his character is so dull  it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se  en . it might sound cool  but believe me  it  s not .  br    br   now  dylan mcdermott  s acting is very good . it  s about one of the very few good things about this movie . he is just inspired .  br    br   morgan freeman is good but nothing special . he has some really cool lines though .  br    br   about the story  although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good . i was expecting a big twist when lazerov  dylan mcdermott  was killed  but nothing really happened .  

=======================================================================================================

164 ===> this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life . i  m not even kidding . it was poorly made and the actors couldn  t act . it was a waste of my time and money . it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own . the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise . nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case . it appears that the director or make  up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie . the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost   minutes of the movie . which watching the credits was the best part of the movie . this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn  t believe how badly it was put together . scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like  whats going on   the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen  s joking around making a fake fight scene .  br    br   if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show  s how awful it truly is . i wish i would have watched it before i rented it .  

=======================================================================================================

165 ===> the haunted world of edward d . wood  jr . isn  t a particularly good documentary . aesthetically  it  s lackluster and cheap looking  the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in  cohesive  but this adds to it  s charm . i say this because it  s a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and  as such  there  s really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits . there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood  and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary . overall  it  s worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general  but don  t expect brilliance here . expect a documentary made after wood  s own heart .  

=======================================================================================================

166 ===> i originally caught this back in     in its one week run at a movie theatre . i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven  t much changed .  br    br   documentary about the infamous edward d . wood jr . covering his life and movies . there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him . they include vampira  dolores fuller  bela lugosi jr .  loretta king  gregory walcott and paul marco . interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations . it is interesting  somewhat  but was this really needed  i  ve seen all of wood  s films and they  re just terrible . wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out . i wouldn  t say he was the worst director ever but he  s down there . do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker  i do like the fact that they didn  t try to make wood out to be some sort of saint . more than a few of those interviewed  especially lugosi jr .  pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear . also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the     s and   s . still it  s of interest if you  re a wood fan . the best interviews are with vampira  who tears wood apart  and dolores fuller  a long time girlfriend  .  

=======================================================================================================

167 ===> every year i watch hundreds of films  including many low budget amateurish straight  to  dvd abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see . i have seen thousands of films in my time  many excellent  many forgettable . zombie nation i will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable  horror  films i have ever seen  in fact i still haven  t recovered from the experience of watching it .  br    br   the day after  it seems like some kind of weird dream . did i really see what i thought i saw  why do the police work out of a warehouse  did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the  zombies  eat cheeseburgers  is it safe  is it safe  is it safe   br    br   i wouldn  t recommend zombie nation if you want to see a  good  film  and neither would i recommend it as  so bad its good  . however  if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever  this is for you . now  whenever anyone asks me what the worst film i have ever seen is  i will say zombie nation .  br    br   seriously  i think it  s a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one  and ulli lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude . he really is the ed wood jr . of the digital age  and i for one can  t wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one .  

=======================================================================================================

168 ===> i  ve discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging . the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary . then you get to the movie and it  s women with raccoon masks on . zero special effects . . . and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by  feet . the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie . the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a  cult classic  . . . however  i can  t possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made . the real horror in this film is how bad it is . i  m embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again   

=======================================================================================================

169 ===>   the haunted world of edward d . wood  jr .  is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as  glen or glenda    bride of the monster   and  of course   plan  from outer space  . this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries  such as  look back in angora  and  the plan  companion   failed . it rounds up his surviving entourage  many of whom have passed away since filming  and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work . nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood  sentimental in its treatment of the director  down to the haunting music   this documentary is an absolute must  see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day . the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed  s life and untimely death for the viewer . best watched at  am while wearing an angora sweater .  

=======================================================================================================

170 ===> this film deals with the atrocity in derry   years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday .  br    br   the film is well researched  acted and directed . it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry . the film puts the atrocity into context of the time . it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity . the disgraceful white  wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with .  br    br   overall  this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking . when the saville report comes out  watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is .  

=======================================================================================================

171 ===> i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film . i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising .  br    br   it  s not enough that the movie itself is a p . o . s .  but the cover art is what sold me . i  ve done better make  up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art . can you say  raccoon eyes    br    br   i  m not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details  but come on  the movie  s main character is an l . a . cop who was born and raised in alabama  but has a german accent    it  s beyond insulting .  

=======================================================================================================

172 ===> i honestly want the last   minuets of my life back .  br    br   the only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen keller i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better .  br    br   then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes .  br    br   they talked like regular people .  br    br   one drove a car .  br    br   some voodoo woman asked what one of the  zombies  wanted and the  zombie  said  i want to dance   br    br    that was it  out came the movie i couldn  t take it any longer can i sue for a  hour of my life       

=======================================================================================================

173 ===> the story of a drifter  his sheep ranch boss  and the boss  s daughter is not for all tastes  but it  s still very intriguing . it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand  amongst the scenery we  ve come to know so well through other films from this region .  br    br   this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan  and i  ve been a fan of hers ever since . the cast also contains bruno lawrence  who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film  smash palace  . terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter  regan  .  br    br   sharply acted  with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads . i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america  but believe you me  the unexpurgated version is not to be missed .  

=======================================================================================================

174 ===> i really like miikes movies about yakuza  this one i saw about  years ago and it really fued my head . never before seen such a sick and twisted thing . the story is good and the actors do their thing very well . i haven  t seen the uk or japan version  but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit censored . if you haven  t seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the nederlands or austria . the i  on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes  but at the showdown i felt that something was missing  about one or two very short scenes .  br    br   all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence  that  s what i like miike for    

=======================================================================================================

175 ===> acclaimed director mervyn leroy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas . high drama is found in the loves and infidelities in new york  s social set . oh yes  don  t forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder . the all star cast features barbara stanwyck  van heflin  james mason  ava gardner  cyd charisse and nancy davis .  

=======================================================================================================

176 ===> the animation in this re  imagining of peter  the wolf is excellent  but at   minutes  the film is sleep inducing . they should have called it  peter  the snails   because everything moves at a snail  s pace . i couldn  t even watch the film in one sitting  i had to watch it   minutes at a time  and it was pure torture .  br    br   save yourself   minutes  do not watch this film  and you will thank me .  br    br   i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees . unfortunately  to vote for the winner in the best animated short  short   category  the voters will have to sit through the whole thing . i already feel sorry for them  and must predict that there  s no way this film will come close to winning .  

=======================================================================================================

177 ===> i love jack  s jokes like  the clich is . . .  or  over the top clich guy  black  oily skin  kinda spooky . . .  . he is just hilarious  daniel  s starting to catch up on him to  good thing jack  s not on the team anymore  in a way  or else it would have been sarcasm mania     i just love all the plots  season   a little less  i have to admit   the characters are great  the actors are great  i  m starting to pick up facial expressions  and more  from jack  daniel and teal  c . . . it just all theoretically possible and exciting . . . oops  their i go again    sorry  i  m also starting to pick up traits from carter  and all of this is driving my parents nutz        well  to conclude  i think it  s good for another three seasons or so  especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor  drama  action and so forth                  

=======================================================================================================

178 ===> the movie starts something like a less hyper  kinetic  more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers . but when a police officer is killed  one tatsuhito gets involved . . . and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved  things get bloody quite fast .  br    br   an earlier work of miike  s  shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol  ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts  though it  s not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces . rather  it  s a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction  as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground  a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost  brothel of young boys  one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning  . tatsuhito  s brother is getting involved with said society  so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm .  br    br   what  s mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis  wang . tatsuhito is a japanese born in china  later moved back into japan  and alienated for it . wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china  so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan . wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character  which is weird enough as it is  much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be . and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he  s forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother . while it would be rude to state that miike  s movies are successful mostly on their shock value  it is true that sometimes it  s easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter  dis  impassioned characters .  br    br     polarisdib  

=======================================================================================================

179 ===> this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale . a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy . they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence . however  after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence . however  out of no where  when they are on a luxury cruise  the ship sinks and they lose everything   and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life  what an odd  silly and preachy film  personally  i  d like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable   br    br   the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions   a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting .  

=======================================================================================================

180 ===> bored londoners henry kendall and joan barry  as fred and emily hill  receive an advance on an inheritance . they use the money go traveling . their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic betty amann  for mr . kendall  and lonely percy marmont  for ms . barry  . but  they remain as boring as they were before . arguably bored director alfred hitchcock tries to liven up the well  titled  as quoted in the film  from shakespeare  s  the tempest    rich and strange  by ordering up some camera trickery . an opening homage to king vidor  s  the crowd  is the highlight . the low point may be the couple dining on chinese prepared cat .  br    br    rich and strange           alfred hitchcock  henry kendall  joan barry  percy marmont  elsie randolph  

=======================================================================================================

181 ===> i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why . one of the problems is the cultural  language one . here we have a chinese  taiwanese  japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties . another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences . nevertheless  it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that . plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence  a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect . all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one .  

=======================================================================================================

182 ===> shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals . why  could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk  and the victims enjoy it  or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull  these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story . it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon .  br    br   should you see this film  yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema . the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters . if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar  barring the insane ending in doa of course  . great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano . the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd . if i haven  t put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i  m sure it will come out in that country .  

=======================================================================================================

183 ===> i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together  the talk is not of the master  s great films like  north by northwest  or  strangers on a train   but a lesser  known effort like this one from      obscure and seriously flawed  which showcases the great director in fledgling form .  br    br   emily and fred hill  joan barry and harry kendall  are a middle  class london couple scrimping to stay ahead . he begrudges their lot she accepts it . change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle  saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . they make plans for a world cruise . but their problems have only begun .  br    br   just ask richard hannay  roger o . thornhill  or marion crane . well  marion  s indisposed at the moment  but you get the idea . travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight  setting one up for a perilous journey at best . this is perhaps hitchcock  s earliest foray into this theme  and not his most successful or memorable . hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element  in this case domestic drama rather than suspense  but the two do not cohere  at least not here .  br    br   the hills are a dull  flat couple  with no chemistry or personality . when they find themselves at the folies bergre  in the form of cross  cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film  they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers .  the curtain  s gone up too soon   gasps emily .  they aren  t dressed .   br    br   when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise  it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing  even if the people they partner off with are drips  too . emily  s man  gordon  percy marmont  carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs  which he suggests be filled by emily . fred  s girl  the princess   betty amann  has clara bow  s eyes and wallace beery  s five o  clock shadow . there  s also an obnoxious fellow passenger  a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . subtlety was still to come .  br    br   everything is shot in an abrupt manner  with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn  t come off  and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears . when fred and emily break off  they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged  together rickshaws  one of many clunky attempts at symbolism .  br    br   emily  s the only vaguely sympathetic character  in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon  but mostly because she  s among the first of hitchcock  s many magnetic blondes  her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film  s conclusion .  br    br   matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set  piece for the protagonists to come to grips with  and presumably repair their relationship . only they aren  t active participants in the resolution  and except for the fate of a friendly cat  nothing about the ending resonates .  br    br   at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early     s  and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food .  rich and strange  is hitchcock paying his dues  and learning his trade  one for scholars but not casual film goers .  

=======================================================================================================

184 ===> there is no suspense in this serial  when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy  the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day . no  in fact  the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode  this show is so boring that i can  t see how it ever got made  let alone released on dvd  obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films  but even the script is awful . an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that  i am not quite sure  because it is too awful to follow . watch the   s version  or the    s versions  or even batman begins  just anything over this version

185 ===> this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy  and the trilogy kicks of to a great start . the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically  and these themes are actually apparent in all his films  if you look close enough . shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders  struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza . the kid brother is a lawyer  and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one  as the movie progresses . the movie takes place in a very harsh environment  and is therefore pretty violent and tough . miike has done worse  but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard . as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex  mostly homosexual in this one . the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie  but with a great drive and true grittiness . if you  ve only seen miikes far  out movies  ichi the killer  fudoh etc .  this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over  the  top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side  as seen in the other films of the trilogy . and as always with miike  there are at least two scenes in this that you  ll never forget  see it and figure out which ones for yourself  .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

186 ===> a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true  miike  film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clich . but  like all clichs  it is based on the truth . all the miike trademarks are here  the violence  the black humour  the homosexuality  the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character . shinjuku is however  one of miike  s most perfectly formed films . he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different  but not necessarily better . i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film .  br    br   as you might expect  the violence is utterly visceral  gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face .  only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that .  the film has a fantastic pace  unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle . dead or alive also deals with similar issues  miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here  the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past .  br    br   i cannot sing shinjuku  s praises enough . i do not want to give away too much . this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano  s sonatine . the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you  ll be popping it back on again to work it all out .

187 ===> granting the budget and time constraints of serial production  batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any  cliffhanger  list  utterly lacking the style  imagination  and atmosphere of its     predecessor  batman .  br    br   the producer  sam katzman  was known as  king of the quickies  and  like his director  spencer bennett  seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement .  unfortunately  this team also produced the two superman serials  starring kirk alyn  with their tacky flying animation  canned music  and dull supporting players .  the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come thoroughly inane titles   robin rescues batman    batman vs wizard    mechanical music droning on  and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around  either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks . batman  s cowl  with its devil  s horns and eagle  s beak  fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes . his  utility belt  is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments  from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments   br    br   in any case  the lead players are miscast . robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne  and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman . he creates the impression that he  d rather be somewhere  anywhere else  john duncan  as robin  has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue . he is too old for the part  with an even older stuntman filling in for him . out of costume  lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink  without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the     serial .  br    br   although serials were not known for character development  the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast . this one offers a group going through the motions  not that the filmmakers provide much support . not one of the hoodlums stands out  and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever   the wizard .   great name   actually  they are led by someone sporting a curtain  a shawl  and a sack over his head  with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing . the  prime suspects    an eccentric professor  a radio broadcaster   are simply annoying .  br    br   even the established comic book  regulars  are superfluous . it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne . despite the perils she faces  vicki displays virtually no emotion . commissioner gordon is none  too  bright . unlike in the previous serial  alfred the butler is a mere walk  on whose most important line is  mr wayne  s residence .  they are props for a drawn  out  gimmick  laden  incoherent plot  further saddled with uninspired  repetitive music and amateurish production design . the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle  class home in any sitcom  the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel . the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing .  the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet    br    br   pity that the filmmakers couldn  t invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure . while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious  batfan   one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box . they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all   chapters of batman and robin combined .  br    br   now for the good news   this is not the     version

188 ===> this show made me feel physically sick  and totally detached from british society as a whole . it was programmes such as this and blue peter that pretended that there were  are no class divisions in britain . they  d always say things like  go into your loft and you may find this . .  or  go into your back garden tonight and . . .   what about us  scummy  working class kids who never never had a  loft   and a  back garden  which was nothing more than a  meter square of balcony on the   th floor of a council block  public service broadcasting  yeah right  and on top of that  it was awfully depressing to see those stupid  middle class  up  their  own  backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having  fun  . . . do me a favour  and  why don  t you  go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on  mama and papa  s  money . . . you make me sick

189 ===> here it is . . the first ever episode of friends  where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar  courtney cox   newly divorced ross gellar  david schimmer   hippy pheobe buffay  lisa kudrow   unknown actor and ladies man  matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing  matthew perry  . this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the  th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green  jennifer aniston  .  br    br   the episode is better than most people give credit for  like any new sitcom the first episode isn  t always fantastic . the acting in this episode isn  t great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters  apart from kudrow and perry  who shine  .  br    br   matt le blanc  man  his acting was down right dreadful because until later  he gets more confident  but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails .  br    br   david schimmer  why does he over pronounce every word  he cannot speak normally  but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons  but he isn  t confident . and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston  looks hot  and does a good job as rachel green  but we only see the real rachel later in the  st season  courtney cox  looks quite anorexic in this episode  its worrying  she looks totally different now   more healthily   she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this   minute pilot  lisa kudrow and matthew perry  i  m doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb  and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe  pheebs  and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically  the episode quality does improve later    such as the sets  they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly  the acting is ok  the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot  i hope we see the friends reunite  cause they will always be there for us

190 ===> and that  s how the greatest comedy of tv started  it has been   years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season . because that  s where  friends  is based on quotes . extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts let  s say a big thanks to rachel  ross  monica  joey  chandler and phoebe    in our first meet  we see how rachel dumps a guy  in the church  how . . .  understand   monica  s search for the  perfect guy   there is no perfect guy  why all you women are obsessed with that      and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she  s a lesbian . till we meet joey  phoebe and chandler in the next episodes . . . enjoy friends   

=======================================================================================================

191 ===> i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is . i was sold on the promise of action  with segal and stealth aircraft  which normally make for an entertaining action movie . i can honestly say i  d rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again . the acting was so awful that it was almost funny . the story was insanely weak  with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f    through them . the script was so poor  if i found out that a   year old wrote it i shouldn  t be in the least surprised . the direction and production is so amateur  i wouldn  t even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video . utter utter drivel . those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art  and they should be ashamed of themselves . steven segal should never ever show his face in public again  i can  t imagine what made him agree to star in this  the worst film i have seen in my entire life .  

=======================================================================================================

192 ===> how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up  with enough cops to run a mini  war that include such weapons as flamethrowers  you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying  thanks  to a corrupt cop .  br    br   you will never get your   ish minutes back . life is too precious to rent this movie .  br    br   i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie .  br    br   if you like justin timberlake  feel free to rent this movie . he does have a very major part in it  so fans might enjoy seeing him .  br    br   however  i believe most of his fans are young girls  who may be turned off by the violence in this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

193 ===> the pilot is extremely well done . it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes . i don  t think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show . it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part . although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode  a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot . an example would be ross and rachels future relationship . even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared  it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice .  br    br   bravo .  br    br   a great start to an unbeatable comedy   

=======================================================================================================

194 ===> in the very first episode of friends  which aired   sept      the one where monica gets a roommate  there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show  the line that plays is  if you ever need holding  . . . . does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song  it is seems as if it is a great song . . . . i would love to get a copy of it . thanks for the assistance . i am looking for the album  cd it is on so i can purchase it .  br    br   i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again . it just seemed to be believable . . . thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years .  

=======================================================================================================

195 ===> well  i can once and for all put an end to the question  what is the worst movie ever made . . . ever   it is flight of fury  starring and co  written by steven seagal . sure there are lots of famously bad movies  but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously .  br    br   it is a romanian  made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood . it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become . this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry  knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again .  br    br   it was released only on video  i can  t imagine why  and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd  s had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling .  

=======================================================================================================

196 ===> star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning  br    br   the american military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other . a renegade pilot  steve touissant  steals it and plots to hold the us government to ransom with it . so they are forced to send in their best man john sands  seagal  who else   to stop him  in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he  s learned over the years .  br    br   i skipped attack force because i could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what i thought . but i decided to give fof a go because shadow man  by the same director  wasn  t bad and  what the hell  seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe  just maybe  he could make a great film again . oh what a fool i was .  br    br   dubbing  horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets  awful camera work  cheap production values  risible  unconvincing fight scenes that have become seagal  s trademark and a boring  sleep inducing plot that doesn  t go anywhere .  br    br   thankfully his next film  once upon a time in the hood  which i  ll be skipping   apparently marks the end of his contract with sony  meaning no more of these awful european lensed action films and his next film prince of pistols might mark a return to theatres . hell  he  s done it before and stallone will have managed to do it before him  rocky balboa .   br    br   this isn  t a flight of fury . it isn  t even a flight of fun . it  s a flight that fails to even take off the ground .   

=======================================================================================================

197 ===> why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy  it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a  . proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film .  br    br   it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die . the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining .  br    br   i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre .  br    br       come on yankies get your english up to par   

=======================================================================================================

198 ===> masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple abby  julia anderson   ciff addison  martin donovan  are driving home  however while talking cliff is distracted  crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road . cliff  s airbag works ok  he walks away with minor injuries  unfortunately for abby hers didn  t  she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car  doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body . abby  s life is saved  just . she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured  horribly disfigured from the burns . cliff decides that she should die  his selfish lawyer ira  corbin bersen  thinks they should let abby die  sue the car manufacturer  get rich while abby  s mum pam  linda sorenson  wants to blame cliff  get rich  save abby . however abby has other plans of her own . . .  br    br   this american canadian co  production was directed by rob schmidt  whose only horror film previously was wrong turn       which on it  s own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode   was episode  from season  of the masters of horror tv series  while i didn  t think right to die was the best masters of horror episode i  ve seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same  still doesn  t come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution       . the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isn  t anything new but it uses it effectively enough although i  d say it  s a bit uneven  the first   minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for   odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abby  s life  the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory  twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart . the character  s are a bit clichd  the weak man  the bent lawyer  the protective mum  the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough  the dialogue is ok  the story moves along at a nice pace  overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here  there where it loses it  s focus a bit  i wasn  t that keen on the ambiguous ending .  br    br   director schmidt does a good job  there are some effective scenes  this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere  out  and  out blood  gore . there are some fantastic special make  up effects as usual  there  s shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body  the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross  images  make  up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser        it  s sequels   then there  s the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with close  ups of scalpels slicing skin open  him peeling it off the muscle  putting it into a cooler box  very messy . there are also various assorted body parts . there  s some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked . . .  br    br   technically right to die is excellent  the special effects are brilliant  as most masters of horror episodes it doesn  t look like a cheap made  for  tv show which basically if the truth be told it is . the acting was fine but there  s no big  names  in this one .  br    br   right to die is another enjoyable  somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene  well worth a watch . . . for those with the stomach .  

=======================================================================================================

199 ===> steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse .  br    br   this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people  in self defence  he  s active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clich  evil english villain  that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days .  br    br   suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent . the story isn  t interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story  characters of movie as a whole such as the  lesbian  interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn  t even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn  t need to .  br    br   in short a terrible script with bad dialog  delivered by sub  par actors  boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes  and non  relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near  impossible and make the movie even worse .  br    br   save   minutes of your life and give this miss  even if you are seagal  s most ardent fan .  

=======================================================================================================

200 ===> i just watched this movie on starz . let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting  writing  directing  special effects  camera crew  sound  and lighting . it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie . apparently back in      when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for    million . now  a  days those things cost about   billion and they cant go invisible . apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour . there was a completely random lesbian scene  which i didn  t mind  but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it . the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes . oh yeah  since its a steven segal movie  its predictable as hell . all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane .  

=======================================================================================================

201 ===> this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh  i think mick garris has a problem with women . . . he kill  em all  they are often the victims  screwfly solution  pro  life  valerie on the stairs  i don  t remember the argento  s episode in season   etc .  obviously imprint  . i think he enjoys to watch women been burn  torture  mutilated and i don  t know . never least  right to die  is one of the best  with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense  specially with the photos from the cell scene  wonderful  . the acting is like the entire series  regular i could be worst like  pro  life  or  we scream for ice cream  . also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode . the ideology of the series is horrible  killing and terminating women  mutilating animals and on and on . . . the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like  cigarrette burns   the best of all    homecoming   the most funny    imprint   really shocking  .  

=======================================================================================================

202 ===> i  m not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a  master  in the genre of horror  since he previously just directed one horror film called  wrong turn  and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre  but fact is that he made with  right to die  one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the  masters of horror  franchise . there was a similar underdog story in season one  when william malone made on of the best episodes with  the fair haired child  even though his other long feature films  fear dot com  and  house on haunted hill  sucked pretty badly .  br    br   the story of  right to die  cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia  but thankfully also features multiple old  fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance  murderous conspiracies  pitch black humor and comic book styled violence . whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband  s continuous adultery  the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident . cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially . whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney  corbin bernsen of  the dentist   want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor  abbey  s mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff . meanwhile abbey  s hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff  s surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices . after a few victims  cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well .  right to die  is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv  series concept like  masters of horror  . it  s violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences . the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well  yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons . the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling . actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks  which is always a welcome plus  and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean  spirited and egocentric bastard . great  moh  episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons .  

=======================================================================================================

203 ===> first of all  f    is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft .  br    br   secondly  the f    s and f    s cannot change their appearances they are not transformers .  br    br   thirdly  the f   has only one m   cannon  not two .  br    br   last but not the least  at the end of the film  seagle selected sidewinder missile . but somehow when he pulled the trigger  the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick . as i have the experience of seeing f    s and f    s being mysteriously transformed into f    s  this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me . however  there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f   . . .  br    br   when students hand in really bad work  teachers assign   s . now i think for the sake of properly marking this film  imdb should seriously consider adding a       option . otherwise  it is not fair for those who receive  out of   . . .  

=======================================================================================================

204 ===> over the years i  ve seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies  and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley  the entertainment level is at a low . sure  the action sequences were amusing  but that was pretty much it . seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege  under siege   and executive decision  at least on the action standpoint   but during the past ten years  these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications .  br    br   on the more positive side  the movie did make good use of time  like some of the action sequences and use of wit . just when the movie seemed to just drag on  a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter . i honestly believe that more of segal  s movies would do better if he wasn  t the only one that fans recognize in the movie . supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing  and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses  maybe the movie will get more popular results .  

=======================================================================================================

205 ===> a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident . when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state  the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live . the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him .  br    br   this comes to us from director rob schmidt  who made  wrong turn   a film i have not seen  . with only one horror film under his belt  and not a particularly notorious one at that  i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode  expecting schmidt to be a  master of horror  in only the most liberal sense . my apologies to him for my underestimation . as of episode   in a   episode season  this was actually the best one yet .  br    br   the issue of the  right to die  is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device . however  this is only the foundation on which the story revolves . once the horror elements show up  the film goes from  decent  to  spectacular  . great acting  great plot  great dialogue  great suspense . i was a little creeped out at times  which is good  and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance  i read a review of this episode prior to watching it  where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of  hellraiser  in this . through the first part of the show  i had no idea what they were talking about . then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of  hellraiser   . however  i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film . i can see no other way to create the effect that was created  and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than  hellraiser   .  br    br   some plot twists show up later on  and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look . i didn  t watch it a second time  but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had  not that it  s confusing  . the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice  and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him . he  s somewhat of an anti  hero to the whole story  if you will . i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist  but he  s completely unlovable .  br    br   while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i  m excited about the  washingtonians  episode  i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine . when legends like john carpenter let me down  again  i get a bit worried about the genre  s future  but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope . this one is a keeper  and please bring schmidt back for season

206 ===> stargate sg   follows and expands upon the egyptian mythologies presented in stargate . in the stargate universe  humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goa  uld such as ra and apophis . for millennia  the goa  uld harvested humanity  heavily influencing and spreading human cultures . as a result  earth cultures such as those of the aztecs  mayans  britons  the norse  mongols  greeks  and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy . many well  known mythical locations such as avalon  camelot  and atlantis are found  or have at one time existed .  br    br   presently  the earth stargate  found at a dig site near giza in      is housed in a top  secret u . s . military base known as the sgc  stargate command  underneath cheyenne mountain . col . jack o  neill  anderson   dr . daniel jackson  shanks   capt . samantha carter  tapping  and teal  c  judge  compose the original sg   team  a few characters join and  or leave the team in later seasons  . along with   other sg teams  they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goa  uld  in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races .  br    br   the parasitic goa  uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship . throughout the first eight seasons  the goa  uld are the primary antagonists . they are a race of highly intelligent  ruthless snake  like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species  including humans . the original arch  enemy from this race was the system lord apophis  peter williams  . other system lords  such as baal and anubis  play pivotal roles in the later seasons . in the ninth season a new villain emerges  the ori . the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy  also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship . the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori  their followers  and their enemiesthe ancients .

207 ===> if you watched this movie you know why i said  jesus  jesus  jesus  . hehehe    every time they said  jesus  jesus  jesus  . . . i laughed thinking  jesus  jesus  jesus  why did i rent this movie   i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen . wtf is timberlake  dreaful acting  i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job  this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him . . . but i really prefer an actor  not this android called timberlake . and his girlfriend was shallow  hollow and annoying as hell . i was happy when they both were popped in the street .  br    br   the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well . the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all . it would have been much enjoyable without him .  br    br   by the way  the music was ok  but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes  low motion and things like that . something misplaced for this cops movie i thought . maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake .  

=======================================================================================================

208 ===> this movie should have never been made .  br    br   what a shame of the budget .  br    br   please hire convincing actors  and make a proper movie . very thin plot  and unconvincing lines . almost hilarious  and that is a shame for an action movie . . . .  br    br   definitely not worth watching .  br    br   they keep replaying the same  shots  of an stealth airplane flying away . you have seen it ones  and that was not worth re  running  or  times .  br    br   it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie  making .  br    br   his movies are getting worser every time .  br    br   black dawn  and submerged were already bad  but this movie is even worse .  

=======================================================================================================

209 ===> i was all ready to pan this episode  seeing that this  master  really doesn  t have any horror films under his belt . . but this is easily the best episode of the season .  br    br   the acting was good   i don  t know how he wrangled it  but we  ve got some real talent in this episode  and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise  at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full   mins  something that has been lacking up to this point in the series .  br    br   i especially liked the bit at the end  not a twist per say  but just a funny little bit where he becomes  as ever  the hen  pecked hubby .  br    br   really good effort . like i  ve said in other reviews  these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes . . but they may someday end up being masters in the future .  

=======================================================================================================

210 ===> maybe it  s just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff  but this one got under my skin  pardon the pun  . this piece is brave  not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies . not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the  screwee   i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself . some parts are very reminiscant of  hellraiser   but come off as tribute rather than imitation . it  s a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider  but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile . this piece brings it and doesn  t appologize . i liked this one a lot . do not watch whilst eating pudding .

211 ===> flight of fury starts as general tom barnes  angus macinnes  organises an unofficial test flight of the x     a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible . general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher  steve toussaint  the job  everything goes well until the x    disappears  even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan  delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone  vincenzo nicoli  who plans to use the x    to fly into us airspace undetected  drop some bombs which will kills lots of people . general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane  sends in one man army john sands  co  writer  executive producer steven seagal  to get it back  kill all the bad guy  s in the process . . .  br    br   this american  british  romanian co  production was directed by michael keusch  was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man        attack force        luckily someone decided the partnership wasn  t working  an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration  s between the two . apparently flight of fury is an almost scene  for  scene word  for  word remake of black thunder       starring michael dudikoff with many of the same character  s even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder  therefore cannot compare the two . flight of fury is a terrible film  the poorly made  written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days . it  s boring even though it  s not that slow  the character  s are poor  it  s full of clichs  things happen at random  the plot is poor  the reasoning behind events are none existent  it  s a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed . the action scenes are lame  there  s no real excitement in it  the villains are boring as are the heroes  it  s right down there with the worst seagal has made .  br    br   flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn  t even matched up that well  the background can change  peoples clothes change  the area changes  the sky  the quality of film changes very abruptly as it  s all too obvious we are watching clips from other  better  films spliced in . hell  seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this . the action scenes consist of shoot  outs so badly edited it  s hard to tell who is who  of course seagal breaking peoples arms . the whole production feels very cheap  shoddy .  br    br   the imdb reckons this had a budget of about            which i think is total rubbish  i mean if so where did all the money go  although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods  it was actually shot in romania  the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan . the acting is terrible as one would expect  seagal looks dubbed again .  br    br   flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring  amateurish  is an almost scene  for  scene remake of another film anyway . another really lazy  poorly produced action thriller from seagal  why do i even bother any more   

=======================================================================================================

212 ===> flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick i  ve ever seen . . . up to now .  br    br   it  s a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest  seagal isn  t really trying in this  he  s fat and his voice is dubbed once more .  br    br   the co  stars fare no better  being a rather sorry load of  rd raters .  br    br   the direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he  s also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers  shadow man  attack force  the screenplay co  written by seagal himself is laughably inept .  br    br   according to imdb    m was spent on this boring load of old tosh  if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent .  br    br   flight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder  which has to be better than this tripe .  br    br   this has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  give it a miss      out of   

=======================================================================================================

213 ===> but the fun is in the journey .  br    br   i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable  not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes  the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times .  br    br   yes  it  s predictable  and yes  it  s a clich romantic comedy . but the point is that it  s a sweet story  the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways .  br    br   the dialog is dead  on and the acting is well done on all parts  and over the top for comic effect . the bulgari scene is worth it  s weight in gold  the actress there deserves honorable mention  for those that panned it for being predictable  if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing . . . then you want a thriller . this is a romantic comedy . . . it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life  and it has been worth every effort along the way .  br    br   great date movie  great movie for a happy cry . . .  

=======================================================================================================

214 ===> this is a really old fashion charming movie . the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies . fi you want to watch a movie that doesn  t demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it . the acting is good  and i really liked michael rispoli . he was in rounders  too . and while you were sleeping . the rest of the cast is fun . it  s just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings . i know . . . sounds kooky . . . but it is . and that  s what makes it fun to watch . it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you  but at least you  ll know .  

=======================================================================================================

215 ===> steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close  up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources . to pick on the technical flaws  silver f  a    s and f    s take of from a carrier for an air  strike  and miraculously become camouflaged f    s for the actual strike  would give this movie more credibility than it deserves . suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe  which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro . putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu .  

=======================================================================================================

216 ===>   flight of fury  is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film  i don  t expect a lot from a seagal film  all i expect is to be moderately entertained for   or so minutes with some mindless action  unfortunately this doesn  t even achieve that low expectation  the action scenes are few and far between  the plot  which is totally irrelevant in these films  is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout  the acting is truly abysmal  bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of  rd raters  i find it hard to believe that anything close to    m was spent on this dire mess unless    m of that   was seagal  s salary  i somehow doubt it  the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that  it  s mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b  movies i  ve endured  br    br

217 ===> does anyone know the exact quote about  time and love  by george ede aka  father fitzpatrick in the move  it had to be you  he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving  if not i will have to rent the movie . this was a great movie . i also loved serendipity  great love story for the soul   br    br   i met my one true love  my soulmate  and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it  i wasn  t ready for that kind of emotional relationship .  br    br   altho  we did marry  i wasn  t mature enough to give as much as i thought i would . i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for  years .  br    br   he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry  in disbelief about the way it turned out . i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart  years .  br    br   this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love . i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me .  br    br   i know when he has healed enough to trust me again  we will remarry .  br    br   don  t ever get complacent and take true love for granted  it has been the hardest lesson of my life .  br    br   also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful  this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting . true love is worth waiting for  if it is meant to be  it will  no matter what  it will happen  nothing is impossible  even when it  s the second time around  thanks   

=======================================================================================================

218 ===> i  d have given this film a few stars  simply because it was a  lifetime  presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story  here  new york city . most on this channel  whether  set  there  in rural iowa  oregon  virginia  l . a . etc .  are filmed in vancouver  ottawa  toronto or some other canadian locale .  br    br   but if there ever were one deserving the top rating     on this site  it  s this movie . certainly not for originality  for this story has been done many times  in many variations  with several very similar to this specific one . it  s also been done pretty often on the big screen  with mega  stars  past and present  from cary grant  james garner  harrison ford  tom hanks  et al  and deborah kerr  doris day  meg ryan  and many more . i can think of at least      more  just as prominent  past to present  off the top of my head  who could be added now  and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind .  br    br   not to drone on  but my point is that  in my opinion  this is by far one of the best of this genre i  ve seen . i caught it by chance on a mid  day friday  at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week . i  d never run across this flick in the  years since it was made . and  while the two leads have done enough to be known to most  they were completely unknown to me . the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman  anna  s mother  whom i  d seen in some things from her younger days  and michael rispoli  henry  charlie  s best friend  who was outstanding as  gramma   the menacing juice loan  tough  street guy from  rounders .   br    br   the chance meeting and coupling between both leads  best friends  as a sub  story romance  with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later  is an oft  done plot contrivance within the genre  but makes no difference to the enjoyment here  in fact  it enhances it  .  br    br   checking some other comments  i agree completely with those which are the most positive . the primary word describing this film is engaging  in caps . this adjective describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters  in whatever combination presented  and all of the supporting and even minor roles .  br    br   i love films with a  harder edge   rounders  the escapist schwarzenegger  stallone fare  goodfellows  even the classics like  casablanca    gone with the wind    citizen kane .  but for pure  uncomplicated enjoyment  this one was outstanding . with a bare fraction of their budgets  it was equal to the results achieved by  you  ve got mail  and  sleepless in seattle .  and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn  t have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here the co  stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega  films  as well .  

=======================================================================================================

219 ===> following the appalling attack force  chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury . to out  stink attack force would take some doing . flight of fury is a marked improvement overall  but still in the grand scheme of thinks  mediocre . mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days  a sad insight into his movie career  s decline . where attack force was a hodge  podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception  to filming  to post production  flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple . someone steals a high  tech stealth fighter  planning to use it to fire chemical weapons  which we later  bizarrely discover  will destroy the whole world in   hrs  . seagal has to get the plane back . it  s that simple  no annoying sub  plots  and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works . that  s not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though  it  s pretty poor . the introduction to side characters is badly done for example .  br    br   in filmic terms fof is bad . it  s badly acted by all involved  and seagal looks bored to tears almost . he  s just got the look of a toddler who  s been forced to perform the school nativity against his will  and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness . can we blame seagal though when the material is so un  ambitious and cruddy  not really . this is the final film of his castel studio  s  multi  picture deal . the producers can  t be bothered to make anything remotely good  promising a   or so million dollar budget  and  after seagal  s obligatory  million  probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves  if the film was made for the remaining  million  then i  m elvis pressley   . so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film that  s already got distribution sorted before it  s made . fan  s though may argue  he at least owes them the effort . he  s seriously looking jaded  and the continued use of stand ins and dub  overs is further indication of this . michael keusch directs with some efficiency  while the cinematography is quite good  but in all technical areas  and as usual with castel  a bog standard stunt team  there  s nothing more than mediocrity  and nothing to help the film rise above its material  and bored leading man . again there  s a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal  which in all truth we don  t want to see .  br    br   overall the action isn  t too bad . it  s nice and violent  and on occasion we  re treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings  but overall nothing special . partly due to a poor stunt crew  and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting . for me  shadow man was a more enjoyable film  because while ignoring the incoherent  jumbled  plot line  there were more vintage seagal moments  and more of him in centre stage . he never disappeared for long periods during the film . seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here  and re  appears after  with little explanation . there  s far too much stock footage used . using stock shots isn  t an entirely horrendous thing  but using it as a crutch is . we  re treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships  all the time  which get annoying . plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place  just check the backdrops  chopping and changing  .  br    br   the film is just middle of the road . it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless  and gratuitous girl on girl scene  with two hot chicks . seagal even perks up briefly then too  overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there  but that  s not saying much at all . this will please many fans  but they should bear in mind  seagal himself would probably want to forget this one  s existence .   

=======================================================================================================

220 ===> i can  t believe that steven segal  s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making  th rate films with  th rate secondary actors . i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .  br    br   the plot is unbelievable as a movie  and even if you excuse the visuals  and had read this story as a novel  you  d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .  br    br   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . he shows no effort and no enthusiasm  and in some scenes he doesn  t show up at all .  br    br   i hate to repeat other peoples comments  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . the condition of those scenes chopped in  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .  br    br   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . i read one review that said the movie had a   million dollar budget  segal being paid  of that  and that the movie still came in under budget . i must concur .  br    br   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie  as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

221 ===> it  s amazing that from a good  though not wonderful  film made back in the early nineties  a whole franchise can grow .  stargate sg   is  without a doubt  a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder  to  shoulder with  star trek  as the kings of sci  fi .  br    br   following on from the     feature film  stargate   this series sees stargate command  a military  science organisation  figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore . sg  is one such team  headed by military veteran colonel jack o  neill  and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson  military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal  c  who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people . earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa  uld  a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods .  br    br   the top  notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life . richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o  neill  who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye . michael shanks  as daniel  brings heart and an will of steel to the character  who has grown from wide  eyed innocence to darker and more hard  bitten as the show has progressed . amanda tapping  as carter  has perfected the balance between depicting her character  s femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong  intelligent military scientist . christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal  c  who is able to depict the character  s emotions with subtlety . and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness .  br    br   almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence  reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs  often shown through arguments between o  neill and jackson  . guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn  t bore viewers . sg  also excels in humour  from o  neill  s wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd  sg  has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death . it isn  t just an excellent sci  fi show but is an excellent show  overall .  

=======================================================================================================

222 ===> sure  this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichs  but it  s entertaining  and that  s what i watch movies for . to be entertained . natasha henstridge is stunning  even with the short hair . her smile is radiant and her beauty can  t be disguised . as for michael vartan  i  m sure the women love him . the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film . i don  t understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them . i guess we see what we want to see .  br    br   olivia d  abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch  even if d  abo  s british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech . to tell you the truth i hadn  t really noticed it until i read these comments  but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me  but she was ideal for her role with that one exception .  br    br   it  s a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others  but who find their soul mates in one another . it may be an unlikely story  but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries  it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube . that  s why we watch them  to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen . i thought these actors did a good job of it  but hey  i  m a sentimental guy who tears up easily . don  t get me wrong though  it has to be a sentimental scene  and this movie had plenty of those .  br    br   i give it     only because i  m saving my      for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day . if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies  or whatever  make a note to watch it . i think you  ll like it .  

=======================================================================================================

223 ===> humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film  and be forced to play a part  mexican or he would have been suspended . believe me  he made the wrong choice  presumably  after the success of  dodge city   warners tried a follow  up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies  like alan hale  guinn  big boy  williams  frank mc hugh and the ever  present john litel  but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v . randolph scott  and as a singer to really make things bad  because she proved one thing  and that is she cannot sing . the story was not too bad  but with bogie clearly miscast also  it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong  and on a low budget  but in fairness  color would not have helped .

224 ===> it has been said   a city on hill cannot hide itself  and virginia city  nevada  perched on the side of mt . davidson at     ft . west of tahoe  is a prime example  or in the context of the movie  should be . virginia city exploded in the american dream as a shower of gold and silver  suspiciously the same year the civil war began . it was the birthplace of the dean of american letters it was where a young reporter named samuel clemens began using the name  mark twain  and went on to become america  s most famous writer . it was also the birthplace of the great hearst fortune  and the launching pad of john mackay  who became the wealthiest man in america  the third wealthiest man in the world . hey  they should have made the movie about him  in the      s virginia city was the boomtown of all boomtowns  the home of the big bonanza  at one time the largest  metropolitan  area west of st . louis and east of san francisco . but virginia city  the movie  misses all that and is more about a hogwash north  south duello between the characters played by errol flynn and randolph scott . flynn is capt . kerry bradford  a union officer who is a pow in a concentration camp run by a mean confederate commander named capt . vance irby  played by scott . these two are always getting in each other  s way . bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being  snuck  out of vc by who else other than . . . irby   hey  what  s he doing here    horrible . bogart plays a laughable mexican bandit who can  t decide who  s side he  s on . miriam hopkins plays a murky character named  julia hayne   obviously a historical lunge at the town  s first lady  julia bulette  who in real life a celebrated prostitute . she goes to washington and talks honest abe about saving bradford  not irby  from hanging and blah blah blah . go figure . they shoulda hung the writer . in  real life  twain reports that on the last day of the war  the setting sun caused the american flag atop mt . davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire  kind of like the movie . three days later they discovered that on that day the south capitulated . one interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks alan hale and guin williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot  like they  re fishing  or trying to make the bullets go faster . not a bad idea for the movie . the same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie . gosh  how could they miss the gold madness  profligate wealth  gun battles in the silver mines  mark twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown  the crooked railroad  the opera house fire  artemis ward  bulette  s huge funeral  the chinese tongs  the black saloons  the auction . .  all this high on a mountain surrounded by desert  the truth was unreal . did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great american holocaust  well  if you count this movie  it wouldn  t be the first debacle to come out of virginia city . it  s a disappointment for virginia city fans because it misses what made the town a  city of illusions   where it is said evil seeps out of the ground . . . okay  other than that it  s a fun movie . flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they  re destroying . if flynn would just play his rotten self i  d double my rating .  

=======================================================================================================

225 ===> i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work . finally found it yesterday        on lifetime movie channel .  br    br   jim larson  s comments about it being a  sweet funny story of  people crossing paths  were dead on . writers probably shouldn  t get a bonus  everyone else sro for making the movie .  br    br   anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it .  br    br   natasha  s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric  to say nothing of her beauty  that anything she is in goes on my favorite list . her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for .  br    br   god bless her  her family and future endeavors .  br    br   this movie doesn  t seem to available in dvd or video yet  but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too .  

=======================================================================================================

226 ===> i caught this film at a test screening . was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story . well acted . natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts . the male lead was awsome . very funny film . takes place in the best locations in new york . made me want to go there . i just saw  you  ve got mail  i thought  it had to be you  was a much better story . fresher .  br    br   it was clean and great for whole family . i think it will do well . audience i saw it with loved it . a definite recommend   

=======================================================================================================

227 ===> slashers   outta  stars   br    br   not really a very good movie . . . but i did like the idea behind it . . . and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with . the movie is ostensibly an  episode  of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off  danger zone  and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them . the survivor  if there is one  wins fame and fortune . . . everyone else just winds up dead . the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad . none of the  real  people seem real at all . the actors playing the killers are kind of fun . . . because they are portraying cheesy and over  the  top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types . . . and that  s exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show . the movie pretends to be done all in one take . . . there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the  danger zone  and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera . . . but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly  to hide the  cuts  from one take to another  i would imagine  .  

=======================================================================================================

228 ===> how can this movie have a  .  this movie was a piece of skunk st . first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded . because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut  that happened to be about oh  quarter of an inch thick  that really cheap as flimsy piece of wood  and he did not even think he could cut threw it  second the person who did the set sucks as at supplying things for them to build with . the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t . v . show . bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of st they call a movie .  br    br   rating  .   

=======================================================================================================

229 ===> i just can  t understand the negative comments about this film . yes it is a typical boy  meets  girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by . henstridge  talk about winning the gene  pool lottery   is as magnetic and alluring as ever  who says the golden age of cinema is dead   and vartan holds his own .  br    br   there is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene  lots  it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together . . .  br    br   ignore the negative comments  if you are feeling a bit blue  watch this flick  you will feel so much better . if you are already happy  then you will be euphoric .  br    br    ps i am    male  from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess . . .   

=======================================================================================================

230 ===> this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than   why not  it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ . johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most  like our churches . the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it . great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans . at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians . thanks fox for producing it . as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece . movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves  in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright  honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith   

=======================================================================================================

231 ===> its spelled s  l  a  s  h  e  r  s . i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs . that was pretty tight . before and after that the movie pretty much blows . the acting is like e  list and it  s shown well in the movie . not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person . the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film . the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny . they said many stupid things that made me laugh . other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman  . anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated .  

=======================================================================================================

232 ===> slashers . . . . . well if you like horrors its definitely one to see  otherwise don  t even bother . it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget  for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere  and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow  trust me you wont need to look for them . also try to ignore the cheesy actors  if thats what you call them   the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being  killers on the loose and whoever live  s at the end gets rich . now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days  for example when i watched it i thought to my self i would  nt mind having a go at this game  especially for    .    .    . so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind .  

=======================================================================================================

233 ===> johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories . the music is great  you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like  i  ve been there too   and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion . cash  s narration is good too .  br    br   but . . . .  br    br    . the actor who played jesus was miscast .  . there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music .  . because it is uncompelling  i doubt we  ll see this ever widely distributed again .  br    br   i  d love to buy the cd .  br    br   tom paine texas  usa  

=======================================================================================================

234 ===> there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years . the gospel road was one of them . i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again . my favorite parts were the fact that  br    br     jesus was blond   br    br     the last supper was a huge meal   br    br     he liked playing with the children   br    br     his death was for all people and for all time .  br    br   the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting  but it touched my heart at that time . besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture . if it ever comes out on dvd  i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons .  

=======================================================================================================

235 ===> more wide  eyed  hysterical   s hyper  cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti  social  pathological behaviour . danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy .  br    br   it  s a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead  or in nursing homes  . i kinda thought about suing them for torture . as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor  defenseless ear  drums  i felt instant  strong pain envelop my entire being . that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits  nevermind glass .  br    br    why didn  t you switch the channel if you didn  t like it    you might ask angrily . fair point  fair point . . . the answer is that i wanted to  but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor  writhing in agony . with my last ounces of energy  i tried to reach the remote but couldn  t .  br    br   a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven  who then proceeds to  pigmalionize  him . lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson  but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up . this may seem like a rather thin plot  but this noisy movie is so chock  full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all . this movie is relentless . forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer  s  reign in blood   as in a south park episode  . whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange   s musical world  it  s all infantile  as if they were all  year  olds impersonating grown  ups . i can only envy people who find movies like this funny . it must be great being easy  to  please what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious  gut  busting comedy .  br    br   but let  s examine this phenomenon  the   s musical . my best guess is that   s musicals offered the more day  dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven  depending on whether you  re church  going or lenin  s  tomb  going   or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy  inspired places . ttono is more akin to a representation of hell  but that  s just me . i don  t seem to  get  musicals . people talk  there is a story  but then all  of  a  sudden everyone starts singing for about  minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened  when you think about it  musicals are stranger than any science  fiction film .  br    br   worse yet  ttono  my favourite type of pizza  btw  is not just a   s musical  but one with opera squealing . opera is proof that there is such a thing as over  training a voice  to the point where it becomes an ear  piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure . the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet . i tried lowering the volume . i lowered it from   to   . then from   to   . then  . i ended up lowering it to a   which is usually so low that it  s only heard by specially  trained dogs and certain types of marsupials  and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys   br    br   take the scene in the small boat in the river . danza starts off with one of his deafening  brain  killing tunes  and then . . . nothing . no animals anywhere to be seen . even the crocodiles  who are mostly deaf  have all but left . if you look carefully  you might even see the trees change colour  from green to yellow  in a matter of minutes . no  this was not a continuity error  it was plain old torture of the flora . and those trees were just matte paintings  imagine how real trees would have reacted .  br    br   the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency  but because glass is only human  hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self  explosion . i can listen to the loudest  least friendly death metal band for hours  but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache .  

=======================================================================================================

236 ===> pathetic . . . worse than a bad made  for  tv movie . i can  t believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick . for some reason morgan freeman  s character is constantly talking about and saying  pussy  when referring to nsync boy  s girlfriend . morgan freeman calling women  pussy  is just awkward . . . what the hell were the people behind this film thinking  too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting  confusing camera angles  a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable .  br    br   i rented this flop with low expectations . . . . but . . . well . . . it really sucked .  

=======================================================================================================

237 ===> i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b  rated movie . i came out surprised and very amused . eva was good  but lake bell stole the show . she had amazing comedic timing . the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between . the plot was enough to tie it all together  a woman  eva  dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was  to  be husband  its sounds far  fetched but it actually works quite well .  br    br        overall its a worthwhile cinema watch  if not get it on dvd when it comes out .  

=======================================================================================================

238 ===> i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say  it was very  very good . on all fronts script  cast  director  photography  and high production values  etc . proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom  com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston  who mug and call it acting . who  da thunk it   br    br   parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as  over her dead body .  lake bell is excellent  too  and this is the first time i have seen her . and finally  paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie  instead of lesser films .  br    br   a movie like this never gets its dues from close  minded males . it  s too bad . as other imdb reviewers here have noted  there is nothing lame about this gem   no hack writing or acting .  br    br   and its depiction of contemporary l . a . and california  in general  makes every scene look bright  beautiful  clean  and otherwise outstanding in every way . never before has a movie made l . a . look so good . ah  what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie .  br    br   i won  t divulge the plot  but as a long  time and hard  core atheist  i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light  hearted piece of entertainment . it reminds me very much of the old  topper  movies  which were also so enjoyable .  br    br   this movie exposes popular  but otherwise hackneyed  movies like  ghost  for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are . we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre . some of us save our praise for the truly worthy  however .  br    br   if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as  into the night  with michelle pfeiffer  jeff goldblum and clu gulager   blind date  with bruce willis and kim basinger   american dreamer  with jobeth williams   chances are  with robert downey jr .  christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard   making mr . right  with john malkovich  etc .  you  ll enjoy this .  br    br   a first  rate job all around  even if it  s kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years .  but even that plot device doesn  t detract from the movie  s overall excellence .  

=======================================================================================================

239 ===> i really didn  t expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv  which is were i live  acting in it . this town is dull and so is this film . there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show . this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn  t any . unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday  then stay away from this movie . the dialog will put you to sleep  the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this . its a predictable movie with no surprises . what you see is what you get and that is a   minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator .  

=======================================================================================================

240 ===> this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california . she thought it was wonderful because it was so real   just the way people in the ohio valley are   i  m from the area and i experienced the film as  just the way people in california think we are   i  ve lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there . we laughed a lot  we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night . the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families . the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else .  br    br   aside from the  if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed  condescension  the story lacked any elements of charm  mystery or even a sense of dread .  br    br   martha  s character was the worst drawn . it  s doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church  but if she had  she probably would have made friends there . i  ve read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was  younger  prettier and thinner  but if this is the case it isn  t shown . all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender . we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions  left out of the loop when social plans are made  used but not appreciated  and finally disrespected and hurt .  br    br   just one more thing are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks  please . this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level .  

=======================================================================================================

241 ===> this had a good story . . . it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool .  br    br   i  ve watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i  ve seen in the two weeks .  br    br   jason bigg  s character was the best though .  br    br   even though it was small  it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning .  br    br   this may be a romantic comedy and i don  t like most  but the writing  direction  performing  sound  design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool .  br    br   this film scored pretty high out of all the movie  s i  ve seen lately  and the rest were big budget or better publicized .  br    br   good job in writing .  

=======================================================================================================

242 ===> this is a great film .  br    br   i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this . i had never heard of it or anyone in it  excpet mike from friends  .  br    br   but it is great  eva  lake and paul give amazing performances . the humour is consistently dry and witty .  br    br   paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends  which works great  . the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic  i mean we are not talking  apocalypse now  here  but the characters are likable  the story is engaging  the soundtrack  production and direction all work well .  br    br   in all a great feel  good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets .  br    br   everyone has their own tastes but i really don  t understand the one star reviews for this .  

=======================================================================================================

243 ===> i just saw this at the venice film festival  and can  t quite decide about it . we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them . maybe that was the point  that we are all in a  bubble  of our own  but these people didn  t compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates . at a running time of just over an hour  the characters weren  t very well developed . lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment  forklifts  conveyor belts  shovels   and the slightly  creepy  looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes  that most of the characters made for a living  were somehow more interesting than the live people . an interesting experiment  but somehow it never quite came together .  

=======================================================================================================

244 ===> san francisco is a big city with great acting credits . in this one  the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city . they didn  t even manage the most basic of realistic details . so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie . you will not be thinking  oh  i  ve been there   you will be thinking  how did a two story firetrap  stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby   some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations . it detracts  but the acting was always competent .  br    br   the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles  at least in the beginning . the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting . the plot is weak  ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies . the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance  they were framed and paced better . but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries .  br    br   the white boy intro was pointless . i think the filmmakers didn  t know what to do with it  so they left it loosely structured and cut it down . the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal  really  folks  everyone knows it  s not  groovy  to live in the ghetto  but his segments are the most humorous . they threw away some good opportunities . educated and embittered on the west coast  a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york . they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable . that would have been interesting this was not .  br    br   the hunter  s point intro was the most disappointing . it was the most derivative of the three  and stylistically the most distant from san francisco . you  ve seen it done before and you  ve seen it done better . even the video game was better   br    br   despite the generic non  locality and aimless script  these characters have potential  the actors have talent  and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction . . . about ten minutes before the ending . good concept placed in the wrong hands .  br    br   ps  there is a missing minority here  see if you can guess which one .  

=======================================================================================================

245 ===> i watched this on an  hour flight and  presumably because of the pressure and the altitude  i actually found it mildly entertaining  emphasis on the  mild   .  br    br   the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies  her fianc falls in love with someone else  she decided to make sure they don  t get together  but eventually she lets them do it . sadly the actual film wasn  t as good . ok  there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well . but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on . i think the whole gay  but  not  gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better . the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn  t really very funny .  br    br   in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me  but it was a close call .  

=======================================================================================================

246 ===> i wasn  t a fan of seeing this movie at all  but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics .  br    br   overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much . this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in   days and just like heaven . a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess . the movie was quite short though  around   min .  but it was enough to tell the whole story  build some character development and have a decent happy ending . the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow . eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast  especially jason biggs  kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace .  br    br   overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating . hey its a chick flick and i  m reviewing this movie from a guy  s persepctive alright  it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it .  

=======================================================================================================

247 ===> this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist . the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst  k . it  s super bowl at the superdome in new orleans . however  no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing . with the many stars in this film  it made no difference . i really don  t know why i watched this .  

=======================================================================================================

248 ===> superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made . the whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl  and all the attempts made to stop them . how tom selleck and donna mills  careers managed to survive this is beyond me . however  the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all  avoid this one if possible .  

=======================================================================================================

249 ===> over her dead body was a nice little movie . it was decent and entertaining  while still being pretty funny . there were a few clich  s  but i found most stuff fresh . at first i didn  t think it was going to be good at all  when it started out . if you can get past the first   minutes though  the movie starts getting more interesting . this film wasn  t burst out in laughter hilarious  and wasn  t oh my gosh wonderful . it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was . i don  t see how this movie was bad . it  s rating is just a bit too low . i could  ve dealt with a  .   but a  .   also  giving this movie a  is disgraceful . it was pretty good  and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a   which is what most people gave it .  

=======================================================================================================

250 ===> i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full   vote if claudia black had not continued on in it  her inclusion as the silly  vela  has brought the series down in my estimation . to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake .  br    br   unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of  jack  and really didn  t need this great series turned into new episodes of  farscape  .  br    br   i was a great fan of the film  stargate  and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film  but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked . i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation

251 ===> the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script  but it is watchable . what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies  and on top of that for movies like this one . i have to admit i had never heard the man  s name before watching this  but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed . the voice is crap  the face is a bad rip  off of legolas  the posture is horrible  and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them . said to say  i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco  because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only . too bad i was wrong . these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance  and they are the main reason i give this a  .  br    br   i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast . . . and cannot believe it .

252 ===> the championship game is only a couple of days away  but things in new orleans aren  t as they should be . from players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose  life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable  wonderful time . can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined   br    br   despite what you might think when you first read about superdome  this is not a football movie . in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought . instead  superdome is another of those lousy soap opera  ish   s made  for  tv movies populated with hollywood has beens and those that never will be . the cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good . the best  or worst  example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he  s there . the plot is dull  uninteresting  and unbelievable . donna mills as a hit  man   yeah  right  it  s about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked david jansen . the movie also lacks any pace . trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow superdome might have had . with no drama or suspense in sight  superdome ends up being a very poor example of a   s made  for  tv movie . the lone highlight for me was the voice  over work from the late charlie jones  a sportscaster i miss listening to . the eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over  hypes the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finest .  br    br   like most others who have seen superdome  i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater     . it may be one of the ktma public access episodes  but it  s one of the best examples of the shows early start . so even though i  ve only rated superdome a      i  ll give this episode a generous    on my mst  k rating scale .

253 ===> once when i was in college and we had an international fair  the russian section had a soviet  era poster saying  ne boltay    meaning  don  t gossip   . i  translated  it for the  generation  of tv watchers as  don  t be gladys kravitz    in reference to the nosy neighbor on  bewitched   .  br    br   however  when you see the result of gossip in the pvt . snafu short  rumors   you see that it  s not quite a laughing matter . in this case  the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states . so  he tells it to someone  who tells someone else  who tells someone else  and it continues . as in  the russians are coming  the russians are coming   the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time  so that when it gets back to snafu . . . well  you know what i mean  yes  it  s mostly wwii propaganda  complete with a derogatory term for the japanese  but i have to say that the pvt . snafu shorts were actually quite funny . of course  since they had dr . seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices  it  s no surprise that these came out rather cool . worth seeing .  

=======================================================================================================

254 ===> friz freleng  s  rumours  is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic  inducing rumours during wartime . produced  as were all the snafu shorts  to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films   rumours  is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan . when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing  it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war . this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long  rubbery piece of baloney and several strange  fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country  s military .  rumours  is inventive  fast paced and funny  all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured   don  t badmouth the military  message . it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts .  

=======================================================================================================

255 ===> when i spotted that noah wyle and ricky schroder were in the same movie  i was like  score  i admit  i was eager to see the movie . and i have to say  the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way . then it went all down hill . i didn  t expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo . they took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story . i was appalled that noah was involved in anything of the sort  especially his role . nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the vietnam war . if anyone really wants to know how communism was like  sit down and read a book on it . and not one that praises it or is against it  just the cold hard facts .  br    br   i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see ricky  s body  but that was all that interested me . everything else about this movie irritated me .  

=======================================================================================================

256 ===> no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie . it  s just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch . bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction . students fist  fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue . the watts riots with a cast of . . . ugh . . .     dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look  alike with the most annoying smile since  mr . sardonicus  . noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift . drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service . silly  giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of  shindig   sing horribly off key  and actually make it big in the music business . and who wrote this compelling dialog    i  m going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair  . . . .  i think i found someone to buy stick  s woody   . . . .  these people are  animals     these people are my  family   as the shirelles sing  mama said  . oh brother  what a mess . this is like a  reefer madness  of the    s except it  s not even funny .  

=======================================================================================================

257 ===> this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors . these were called  instructional  cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny  looking main character called  pvt . snafu .   br    br   all of us have imaginations  along with fears and what  have  you  and that  s what happens here as pvt . snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with  five .  you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them . that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause  as pointed out here in this cartoon . a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy . that  s still being done today .  br    br    we lost the war   declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon . amazing how some americans still haven  t learned . this cartoon may be   years old but it sure has relevance today . as i write this  there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the  war on terror  is just a bumper sticker slogan . amazing .  br    br   the writer  the famous  dr . suess   uses analogies of  hot air balloon juice  here to present the above message . with theodore geisel  his real name  you know the rhymes will be clever .  br    br   nothing hilarious here  but it wasn  t meant to be . you have to understand the climate of     and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii . people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning . it was a tense time

258 ===> though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original  the vanishing   spoorloos  it does have the same overall feel  except for that koolhoven  s style is less business  like and more lyric . the beginning is great  the middle is fine  but the sting is in the end . a surprise emotional ending . as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film  but it is done all very beautifully . never explicit  but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . it is a shame american films can  t be as open an honoust as this one . where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject   de grot  stays always within the boundaries of good taste .  de grot  tells an amazing story stretched over more than   years . when you  ll leave the cinema you  ll be moved . what can we ask more of a film  anyway  this film even gives more . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

259 ===> couldn  t go to sleep the other night . so i got up  flipped on the tube  this movie was on .  br    br   film makers bit off more than they could chew . just as ambitious in scope as  forrest gump  was . but gump read like an fairy  tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era . tgmb just relies on tired clichs to tell the story . almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up . every character  s purpose was to fill a silly    s archetype .  br    br   take how we  re introduced to finnegan hugging his black maid  receiving a framed picture of mlk . criminey  talk about heavy  handed . why not just give him a t  shirt saying  i heart black people    br    br   sunshine  isn  t free love groovay  man  oh no  i didn  t have my period .   br    br   mary beth  i want to go to berkeley  not square ucla .  uh  excuse me  there was nothing square about la in the   s . rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique  we just hear this brat whine about not going there .  br    br   can  t even remember the black kid  s name . he was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are .  br    br   thing is  period pieces don  t have to be this cheesy . take  dazed  confused .  look how we  re introduced to the football hero  randall floyd . we don  t first see him on the football field . in fact  we never see him play football . we  re introduced to him in class  inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party .  br    br   in  dazed  feminism isn  t a casual by  product of some chick getting knocked up . it  s much more organic  more serious than that . it  s refined in the ladies  room over a flip discussion about gilligan  s island . serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings . but real life is like that .  br    br   some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant . i agree  which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of baby  boomer pornostalgia .

260 ===> major league back to the minors         br    br   starring scott bakula  eric bruskotter  corbin bernsen  dennis haysbert  jensen daggett  written and directed by john warren    minutes rated pg     for language and some violence   br    br   by blake french  br    br   believe it or not  in the new john warren comedy  major league back to the minors  there is one funny scene . it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face . it  s not much  but with the exception of a few one  liners  it  s all this film has to offer . . . enough said .  br    br   this movie is not only structurally impaired  characteristically undeveloped  predictable and badly written  but also just plain bad . even non  critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got . it is so familiar it just isn  t funny .  br    br   how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made  last years we saw this same material in  air bud golden receiver   and as bad as that film was  this is even worse . at least  air bud  was family oriented .  major league back to the minors  is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon . it is too childish for adults . so who is this film for  teenagers  elderly  people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this   br    br   the film  like many others like this  has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all . yes it does  and what a great moral to try to prove . too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes . where the silly announcers form their own  buddy comedy routine  muttering one liners to themselves like  they suck    this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass    this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost   maybe it was his mind    somebody needs a nap   and  ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play .  where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name . and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny .  br    br     major league back to the minors  is so bad it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence . the good baseball team is on a comeback  they are about to win and   the power goes out . i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion  but in reality  its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time . the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny . there is another kind  of  funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer . the coach  s answer  you  re too old  too slow  and too fat .  the player  s reaction is to die for . but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time  and certainly is not worth a cent of your money .  br    br   so here is another dreadful entre into this genre of film  another that is doomed with its own script  which is failed before seen  and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

261 ===>   de grot  is a terrific dutch thriller  based on the book written by tim krabb . another of his books   het gouden ei  was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called  spoorloos    the vanishing   in     . this one is not as good as that thriller  although much better than the american remake also called  the vanishing   but there are times it comes close .  br    br   especially the opening moments are terrific . we see a man  later we learn his name is egon wagter  fedja van hut   coming from a plane in thailand . when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border . these scenes are perfectly directed  photographed and acted . a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this . later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman  both stating that they have never done anything like this .  br    br   from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash  forward . we see how egon  still as a child  here played by erik van der horst   befriends a guy named axel  as a kid played by benja bruijning  . we learn how they grew up as friends  sort of  and how axel  as an adult played by marcel hensema  became a criminal . egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman . around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him .  br    br   the movie is chronological in a way . it shows egon and axel as kids  than as students  young adults  and in their mid  thirties . but from time to time  like i said  the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again . every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults .  br    br   minor spoilers herein .  br    br   the title means  the cave   and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending  although it is in fact not that happy . like the beginning  the ending is terrific . the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes  only to come back at that point in the end . it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending  although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well .

263 ===> how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel  all it does is throw balls  worst of all  it doesn  t compare to even the first installment of the series  the comedy suffers from not being funny . where did all the unintentional laughter go  enough slapstick on  the  field action goes on too long . bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine  inning shutout . what  s next  major league   return to the little league  ehh  could be  leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all  star game . this one  s had three strikes too many .  

=======================================================================================================

264 ===> this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise . i live in minnesota and even i can  t believe they dumped cleveland .  yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good  and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league  but still be consistent .  anyway i loved the first major league  liked the second  and always looked forward to the third  when the indians would finally go all the way to the series . you can  t tell me this wasn  t the plan after the second film was completed . what happened  anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don  t watch this junk .  

=======================================================================================================

265 ===> i started watching the show from the first season  and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it . original movie was kind of childish  and i was just looking for some sci  fi show while waiting for the bsg new season .  br    br   but after few episodes i became a fan . i  ve loved the characters  the not  so  stupid  as  you  think  he  is jack o  neill  the not  only  smart samantha carter  the glorious teal  c  women and kids favorite  and brilliant dr . daniel jackson .  br    br   of course  stories sometimes not serious  sometimes even ridiculous  but mostly it  s not about technology or space fighting  it  s about helping your friend  even risking your life for him . it  s about  we don  t leave anybody behind  . struggling to the end when all hope is lost . about the free will  and all good qualities that makes a human  human .  br    br   and now it  s breaking a record  going   th season  and still doing good .  

=======================================================================================================

266 ===> indian directors have it tough  they have to compete with movies like  laggan  where   henpecked  castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots .  devdas   a hapless  fedar  festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion  with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one  s feelings or sentiments  alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry . but to make a good movie  you have to tight  rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum  dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit  bollywood  leading actor who is marginally handsome . so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words  defending his village  this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience . there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar  narasimhan  . nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him  meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson . this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india . nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films . the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with songdances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won  t sell  a sad but true state of affairs . faster this changes better for  bollywood  . all said and done this is one good movie .

267 ===> this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise . i live in minnesota and even i can  t believe they dumped cleveland .  yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good  and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league  but still be consistent .  anyway i loved the first major league  liked the second  and always looked forward to the third  when the indians would finally go all the way to the series . you can  t tell me this wasn  t the plan after the second film was completed . what happened  anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don  t watch this junk .  

=======================================================================================================

268 ===> this movie is so bad it  s funny . it stars scott backula as some coach  but that  s not important  what is important is the large black fellow who plays  st base . first off he has to be at least   years old  yet still plays minor league baseball  second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk  let alone run . coach backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time . backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film   spoiler   he tells his star player  downtown  to hit a home run  clearly  downtown  viewed this as a good move . he hit the home run and won the game for his team  a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the majors in the movie . now if only tony muser  manager of the royals  would be as smart a coach as backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat  the royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game .  

=======================================================================================================

269 ===> good movie  good music  good background and an acceptable plot . but the main point again as his movies tend to be  the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold . nana patekar . this may be his second best performance after parinda  others may disagree  . although other movies are not far behind . one man that will never ever disappoint you .  br    br   good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without . you can see in his movies  others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins . but this man is really something elase .  br    br   the movie is cool  the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good . a must watch .  

=======================================================================================================

270 ===> this is probably karisma at her best  apart from zubeidaa . nana patekar also gives out his best  without even trying . the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag  especially when shahrukh comes in the picture . what really made me like it were the performances of the leads  the dialog delivery  as well as the story  for what it was . it could  ve been directed better  and edited . the supporting case was even great  including karima  s mother in law  even though she just had one shining moment  it was great to watch her .  br    br   the sets were also pretty good . i didn  t really like their portrayal of a canadian family  but once they step in india  it  s as real as it gets .  br    br   overall  i would give it a thumbs up   

=======================================================================================================

271 ===> this is one very dire production . the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal  she was a very beautiful young woman . here was the production  s weakest point  the actress failed to get that across . it also appeared that the production budget couldn  t stretch to a hairdresser  from the outset  the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush . the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical .  br    br   the production was a flaw ridden  clich ridden  embarrassing load of rubbish . i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas   

=======================================================================================================

272 ===> for months i  ve been hearing about this little movie and now i  ve seen it . i find it cute  cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people  s creative ideas in order to make their own one  joke premise of a movie . troops  swingblade  any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind . if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood  s door then they  re doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films . how many times have you heard the phrase   it  s animal house meets back to the future    it  s wall street meets dead poet  s society   or  shakespeare in love meets star wars   i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable .  

=======================================================================================================

273 ===> seeing this movie was the most fun i  ve had at the cinema in a long time . however  i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film  because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied . this picture has everything any movie could ever have . it has characteristics of a romantic comedy  a political commentary  a thriller  a drama  an action movie  a musical  and an absurdist self  conscious art film . it  s all in there  adding up to a myth .  br    br   the basic premise is about an indian couple  nandini  karishma kapoor  and shekhar  sanjay kapoor   happily living in canada  who rush to india to visit the husband  s parents after a disturbing news report . the rest of the story takes place in india  where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence . at one point  the story borrows from  not without my baby   but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice .  br    br   the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions  including shah rukh khan  s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie . in fact  the two stars are on all the posters  but they appear really late in the film  and only shah rukh ends up being a real character . yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance .  br    br   karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film  and she does an admirable job  having to link up the film  s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion . another notable presence is nana patekar  who plays narsimha  the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar . nana patekar dominates every scene he  s in with a scary but nuanced character .  br    br   the movie is not without its share of realism . violence is rampant  but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters  with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions . at times  this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic .  br    br   i have seen a share of bollywood releases  and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm . but  shakti  raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous . it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy  where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained . it is pure  gratuitous cinema  and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book . perhaps  the all  important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind  but i came out of watching  shakti  exhilarated . making movies can be the most fun in the world   

=======================================================================================================

274 ===> okay  i know this does  nt project india in a good light . but the overall theme of the movie is not india  it  s shakti . the power of a warlord  and the power of a mother . the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth . then things go terribly wrong . the interaction between nandini and her father in law  the power of their dysfunctional relationship  and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie . shah rukh khan  s performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor . it is easy to get caught up in the love  violence and redemption of lives in this film  and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax . the musical interludes are strengths  believable and well done .  

=======================================================================================================

275 ===> where  s michael caine when you need him  i  ve seen most of the many seasons of mst  k  but this rare pre   st season flick  episdoe k     is easily one of the worst movies ever made . three  stars   lee majors  chris makepeace and burgess meredith  struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever  delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick cheney  style workgroup composed of exxon and gm lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research . looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness  possibly on super  . makes logan  s run look like the cinematic sistine chapel crossed with shakespeare . i can  t imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and servo since it  s unwatchable even with it . clearly what  s needed in hollywood is some sort of    k which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care . with its  rights to pollute and drive  theme  by the end  i  m half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his  cold dead hands  speech . lee  i could have forgiven you for this in      but

276 ===> stupid  mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes  piloted by burgess meredith  chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades  old gasoline sludge  driven by lee majors  with chris makepeace as the runaway techno  wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously  and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society . as moronic as it sounds . terrible waste of burgess meredith  but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film .

277 ===> the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother  s love  the exceptional performances  the steady execution and the quite innovative script . the film tells the story of an indian woman  nandini  who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja . all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india  of whom she had not even known  is in troubles and the couple rush to india . when they get into the village  nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhar  s family  ruled by his cruel  highly cynical and merciless father narasimha  lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless . nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home  but he is soon killed by his father  s enemies . when she wants to leave  narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india . here starts the intense struggle which can be called  nandini vs . narasimha  .  br    br   india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film  but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas  so it may be even correct . the portrayal is in my view fair and not one  sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent . such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world . the locations are amazing  the music is wonderful  and krishna vamshi  s direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing . one thing that must be noted is the very ear  pleasing background score by ismail darbar  it is beautiful . the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film . portrayed realistically throughout  the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch . its dialogues are superb and intelligently written  and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points  a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension .  br    br   the film  s biggest strength is the performances . karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini . her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible . she displays so much intensity  impulsiveness  anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son . her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child . after fiza  this is her most powerful performance . one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen  nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha . he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him . patekar displays cruelty  wittiness and even humanity with total conviction . he is outstanding . another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india  s most underrated actress  deepti naval  who sensitises her character to perfection . sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief . anyway  do watch shakti  it could have been better  but it is definitely a must  watch .

278 ===> if any movie stands out extremely with the actors  acting skills  this is probably the one . i  ve never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way  but having a strong feeling . the movie was disturbing at moments . however  the movie was terrible at editing . the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs  yet they feel out of place . like karisma is getting beat up  and the same time srk is fighting  comically  with the police officers . the ishq kamina song was very out of place . on top of that  the movie is overly glossy in the beginning . the direction was not bad  but certainly nothing one can brag about .  br    br   i have to say that the actors  were chosen very wisely . without them  this movie would not have an impact . karisma kapoor has given her best role to date  and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza . she looks pretty in the first half  and i  ve never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her . what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date . nana patekar was excellent as her father  in  law . not much to say about him  besides this is a role made for him . deepti naval as the mother  in  law was excellent especially in her final scene . though she doesn  t have much to say  her facial expressions and body language was good . the other good performance was the little kid . he was adorable  and is sure to bring tears to the viewer  s eyes . the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances . sanjay kapoor was all right  but he didn  t have much to do . shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role .  br    br   one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina . the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song . and boy aish is mad hot . however  the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever . people may have come to the movie for aish  but they won  t brag too much about it after  wards . hum tum miley was properly paced  but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie . damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about . dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie . despite the poor editing  the performances alone make it a must see .  

=======================================================================================================

279 ===> i saw this movie years ago  and i was impressed . . . but then again i was only   years old . i recently re  watched it and want that time back . this film is pretty bad . while i like lee majors  chris makepeace  watch my bodyguard       if you would like to see a good movie that he was in . . . of meatballs  also starring bill murray  for some laughs   and burgess meredith  this role does  did nothing for their careers .  br    br   anyway  lee majors character  franklyn hart  is an ex  race car driver who plans on driving his race car  which he had in storage  across the country to california . one problem the government has outlawed all private transportation . i thought the concept was ok  not the worse i  ve heard of   but the execution failed horribly .  

=======================================================================================================

280 ===> there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud . the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring . just a notch above lowbrow  thanks to freeman and spacey  who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films   the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non  existent as justin timberlake  s acting . i hate to knock the guy  but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte  the better .  br    br   the movie isn  t all bad . . . just mostly . i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man . he deserves it . and  unlike his fellow musician and co  star  he can act . kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well  you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery   and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars  out of ten . . . he  s not that good  .  br    br   when all is said and done  the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo  action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake . it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters . all in all  t  s just plain boring . that being said  rent this when you are suffering from insomnia .  

=======================================================================================================

281 ===> uneven bollywood drama . karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend  sanjay kapoor   has a child  and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords . drama and tragedy ensue  and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller . film is compelling  its few song  dance numbers are uninteresting and needless  the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film  s drama  at least once we  ve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative  if ultimately misplaced as well . likewise  the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy  go  lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce  and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with . his throw  away comic  book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film  s primary gripping drama . the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord  and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long  suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film  s best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay  s sisters in india  and very pleasing eye candy . but sanjay himself overacts terribly  especially during obvious ad  libs . the directorial style of writer  director krishna wamsi is sloppy  rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts  although his camera movement is good . the musical underscore is also quite effective  moody  featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble  too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti  s soundtrack cd  but bollywood hasn  t yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums  at least not in most cases  . but shakti is karisma kapoor  s film  all the way  though  and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes . despite the unevenness of much of the picture  karisma  s performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures . in a strange way  also  i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i  d noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette  both of which i  d seen just prior  although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism  controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china  s tang dynasty  whose self  serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext .  

=======================================================================================================

282 ===> what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band . this disc is not for the faint of heart . . . the music is incredibly intense  and very cool . what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long . it is true that their records were great  but their shows were the top of the heap . in     when this concert was shot  the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands  and audiences  had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity   something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina . what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise . try the concert out  it really is amazing .  

=======================================================================================================

283 ===> dull  flatly  directed  comedy  has zero laughs and wastes a great cast . alan alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows . newcomer anthony lapaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it  s not enough .  br    br   one of those scripts that  if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer  would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion .

284 ===> one of the lamer wedding movies you  ll see . smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters . the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke  except they just aint in the least bit funny here . molly ringwald  well what else needs to be said . give you a clue to the silliness  she destroys a        wedding dress  because  it just won  t be me  makes it into this rag  with straps and puts on a top hat  and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy  rather than ringwalding her neck . its a helluva a cast too  check out how heavy ally sheedy is . wheeeew

285 ===> this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john entwistle .  br    br   the original drum and bass .  br    br   there seems to be very little early who footage around these days  if there is more then lets be  aving it  now  a  days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether  a parody  a shadow of their  much  better years . to be fair  not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore  they  ve earned their respect and with overtime .  br    br   this concert footage for me is one of their best . to command an audience of around a        plus strong crowed takes skill  charisma  wit and a whole lot of bloody good music .  br    br   we all know of the other acts on the bill  the doors  their last ever show weeks before jim morrison died   moody blues  hendrix  taste  free and many more . the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see . this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the      s woodstock . the film and record had come out and so had the who  s greatest work to date  tommy . the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste  to be able to experience their own unique event  to be able to  grove and love  in the knowledge that this gig was their own . to do this you needed the best of what rock  n roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd .  br    br   at two  o clock in the morning in late august     the m . c . announces   ladies and gentlemen  a small rock  n roll band from shepherds bush london  the  oo  .  br    br   john entwistle  s body suit is of black leather  on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe  roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel  s and long flowing hair  keith in a white t  shirt and jeans  as pete had his white boiler suit and doc martins that he  d preferred to wear .  br    br   the who never stopped their onslaught of high energy rock for over two hours  performing theirs and other artists  greatest tracks such as young man blues  shaking  all over  and then as on queue  keith baiting the crowed to  shut up  it  s a bleeding opera  with tommy  the rock opera . the crowed went wild . this is what they had come to hear  and the who didn  t disappoint  straight into overture and never coming up for air until the final note of  tommy can you hear me   amazing .  br    br   to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history .  br    br   the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english  linear pcm stereo  were as in the states  i think  you can get it with  .  at least   check local press for details  on that  okay .  br    br   the duration of the dvd is   minutes with no extras  which is a disappointment . yes  for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play  for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be  live  raw and in your face   br    br   i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn  t for the lack of  .   and some extras would have been nice .  br    br   thanks roger  pete  john and keith .

286 ===> this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as  mitchell in malta .  at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit . . . not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger . mitchell being mitchell  the film wouldn  t have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either . oh well . at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst . i can  t imagine watching it on it  s own  however .  

=======================================================================================================

287 ===> this   minute documentary buuel made in the early      s about one of spain  s poorest regions is  in my opinion  one of his weakest films . first  let  s admit that   years later  spain is much richer than it was then  and when i say this  i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own  like excessive individualism and consumerism  though all in all wealth it  s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here  . and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buuel favored  but with western european style capitalism . but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene  the narrator chides that in school  children are taught the value of pi . teaching math to poor people  the horror  . buuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here  not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation . what is he proposing  that children are taught exactly what at school  doesn  t buuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people   

=======================================================================================================

288 ===> the writer  director of this film obviously doesn  t know anything about film . i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey  because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun .  br    br   the story was awful  the characters were very one dimensional . for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans  that someone is kidding their self  it was probably the writer  director  . no poker fan in this world likes this movie . even your money man hates this project . to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn  t give you the experience to write about poker . keep your day job . and if it  s playing poker  then you must be hurt  n .  

=======================================================================================================

289 ===> kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie  panaghoy sa suba is very good   it has the drama  the action  the romance  and scene that will make you laugh .  br    br   while the story is not that original  a love triangle   or make a four  cornered  love  japanese occupation  rebellion  american as lord   its presentation is something cool  especially it uses it original language   bisaya for the filipino  nipongo for the japanese and english for the american .  br    br   this movie will go as one of this year  s best pinoy movies .  br    br   go watch this   

=======================================================================================================

290 ===> well it  s been a long year and i  m down to reviewing the final film for     . panaghoy sa suba  call of the river  placed second in the recent metro manila film festival . as expected  it didn  t do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies .  br    br   it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen . i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director . his great vision and creativity really helped this film . he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film . also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio . she did a great job portraying bikay  the younger sister of duroy . i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres . i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her .  br    br   some of the camera shots in the film were done very well . the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different .  br    br   in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film . i certainly won  t be raving about the story of this film .  

=======================================================================================================

291 ===> totally ridiculous . if you know anything about poker  you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless . the nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker  but i doubt he  s ever played above    .  i think he also knows nothing of golf .  where to start . i  ve seen better productions in the intro to film class i took freshmen year of film school . the actors to watch in this movie are queen momma  scotty nguyen  and the loser who can never win at poker . everyone else is as wooden as they come  like bad porn actors .  br    br   spoiler the man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made . he is a railbird who doesn  t play poker and never has a line of dialogue  but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie . i can  t think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production . it  s fitting that he had such a useless role .  br    br   there  s very little poker in this movie . most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots aren  t resolved in the slightest . queen momma does have a show  stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out . also the nameless arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them . their subtle performances are easily among the film  s highlights . it makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads .  br    br   in conclusion  complete nonsense . plan  from outer space has slightly more coherency . if you play poker though you might want to have a laugh . also if you  re christian you might enjoy some of the heavy  handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper . i hate movies made by religious people . especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about . it  s sad that jennifer harman and scotty nguyen got involved in this travesty as i can  t help but think less of them . they must be envious of johnny chan for getting in rounders .  

=======================================================================================================

292 ===> when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one . now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd  they had not viewed it on the silver screen   my opinion remains the same . the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak .  

=======================================================================================================

293 ===> as a kid  i loved this game . i played it a zillion times during spring     with my friend andrew . i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored . then streets of rage  came out . and we quickly forgot that this one even existed .  br    br   you play as ex  cops axel stone  adam or blaze fielding  who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way . there are  levels to work thru in a run  down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x . beating up all the bad guys and the end  of  level boss is much fun . level   the bridge  was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river . you even have the chance to become mr . x  s right hand man at the end of the game  at a price  . this leads to the  bad ending  in which you become the the boss of the syndicate . exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr . x  but never mind .  br    br   streets of rage also has truly fantastic music . the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis . the main theme  level one  level  and final boss are standout tunes .  br    br   as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console . but with streets of rage  also available  it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete .  br    br   pros  br    br   average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic  book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game .  br    br   great tunes .  br    br   easy to get into and hard to put down .  br    br   cons  br    br   vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage  .  br    br   poor enemy ai . baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat . this is especially infuriating with the level  boss .  br    br   lack of combo moves .  br    br   lack of decent weapons .  br    br   bad guy models are repeated far too often .  br    br   graphics b  sound a  gameplay b  lasting appeal b   

=======================================================================================================

294 ===> on sunday july         the first episode of a new science fiction series called  stargate sg    was broadcast on showtime . a spin  off of and sequel to the     film  stargate  starring kurt russell and james spader  the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film . for ten seasons  it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg   . originally  the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o  neill  two  l  s    michael shanks as dr . daniel jackson  amanda tapping as captain samantha carter  christopher judge as teal  c and don s . davis as major general george s . hammond . for ten long years  we watched the team battle against the goa  uld  the replicators  the ori and many other aggressors . at the same time  they forged alliances with the asgard  the tok  ra  the rebel jaffa  the nox and the tollan . they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up  not until death claimed them . and sometimes not even then .  br    br   as with all long  running series  they were numerous cast changes . michael shanks left the series in january     at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor . daniel jackson  s successor as the team  s resident archaeologist  geek was jonas quinn  an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara  played by corin nemec . however  shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june     and nemec left at the same time . unfortunately  he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards . don s . davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march     as he felt that it was time for him to go . the show  s original star and arguably its most popular actor  richard dean anderson  starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons . his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons . he finally left  sg    in march     in order to spend more time with his then six  year  old daughter . jack o  neill was by far my favourite character in the series and  truth be told  i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason .  br    br   the ninth season represented a new era for the programme . with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa  uld and the replicators in season eight  many fans felt the series should go out on a high . regardless  the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa  uld as the series  main adversaries . three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re  invention . ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt . colonel cameron mitchell  the new leader of sg   . his  farscape  co  star  the lovely claudia black  began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious  sexy  hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran  a former goa  uld host and con artist from another planet . a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons  she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season . rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry  the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o  neill and general hammond . for the last two years  they starred alongside the  sg    faithful  michael shanks  amanda tapping and christopher judge  and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise .  br    br   alas  all good things must come to an end . during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten  ratings dropped considerably  resulting in cancellation in its august     . after ten seasons and    episodes  the dream was finally over . on march         what began with  children of the gods  ended with  unending  . the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci  fi channel in the united states on june        .  br    br   in the ten years that the series was on the air  it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series   star trek   in terms of popularity in certain countries . it became the second  longest running sci  fi series in the world  second only to  doctor who              and the longest  running american produced sci  fi series  having surpassed  the x  files  only a few months before it ended .  br    br    stargate sg    represents the cornerstone of the  stargate  franchise . in      its success and popularity led to the production of a spin  off series entitled  stargate atlantis   which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and    episodes in august     . although plans for another feature film fell through  two direct  to  dvd films   stargate the ark of truth  and  stargate continuum   were released in     and more are planned for the not too distant future . a third live  action series   stargate universe   is also due to premiere at some point next year .  there was  unfortunately  an animated series   stargate infinity   which ran only from     to     but the less said about that the better  . despite the end of  sg    and  atlantis  as continuing series  the future of  stargate  looks very bright indeed .  br    br   in conclusion  while  stargate  has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci  fi television franchises such as  star trek  and  doctor who   its still relatively new compared to those two sci  fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many  many years to come .

295 ===> honestly before i watched this movie  i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace . i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie  and watched it by my own . apparently they were right . i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie  why the hell did i watch this movie .  br    br   of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie  theater business . but morgan and kevin  i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison . to be honest  their roles are rather stupid .  br    br   well you might think if the players suck  then i should pay more attention to the story . it is indeed story is the core of a movie  but guys . . . trust me . . . this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story . imagine this  a smart  ass journalist  justin timberlake  wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a  real  journalist from his boss  morgan freeman  . this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice  ll cool j  and an brilliant investigator  kevin spacey  . at the end  they beat the system with a happy ending story .  br    br   jeez  i could not even carry on with this . just recalling the movie is making me sick already . my advise guys  don  t watch this  please save your money and time for another movie .

296 ===> amateur  no budget films can be surprisingly good . . . this however is not one of them .  br    br   ah  another brad sykes atrocity . the acting is hideous  except for emmy smith who shows some promise . the camera  direction  needs serious reworking . and no more  hold the camera and run  gimmicks either it just doesn  t work . the special effects are unimaginative  there  s a problem when the effect can be identified in real time . if you  re going to rip off an ear  please don  t let us see the actor  s real ear beneath the blood . the scenery is bland and boring  same as mr . sykes other ventures   and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal  see the scenery comment  .  br    br   did i mention the lack of any real plot  or character development  apparently  the scriptwriter didn  t .  br    br   whoever is funding this guy . . . please stop . i  ve seen some of his other  home movies   which i will not plug  and they are just as bad . normally  a  director  will grow and learn from his previous efforts . . . not this guy . it  s one thing to be an amateur filmmaker  but anyone can be a hack .  br    br   definitely not even a popcorn film . . . of course  chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort .  br    br   award the worst ever military push  ups in a film .  

=======================================================================================================

297 ===> all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done . it may not be up to par with what everyone expects  but look at it this way . would you expect perfection in hell  it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose . it was great to see her character transformation in this movie  considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get . i hope for a sequel very soon . if we want live action  i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori . i don  t think lady death would transfer well to film . but be that as it may  it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong . no pun intended .  

=======================================================================================================

298 ===> it  s a very good movie  not only for the fans of lady death comics  but also for those who like animated movies  series of adventure and fantasy .  br    br   the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn  t done  but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell  lucifer himself .  br    br   then she seeks revenge . . . and the rest you better see it from the movie .  br    br   i liked the movie a lot  the characters are like the original comics  form chaos . i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics  only the last ones  after the passages in the movie  so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics  but . . . one way or another it  s the story of lady death   

=======================================================================================================

299 ===> this is a typical  perfect crime  thriller . a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer  ignoring all the clues  immediately knows who guilty is . the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught . the result is like every single episode of  columbo  or  murder she wrote  . the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock  this story barely fills up   minutes but the director insists on using all    minutes filling with every cliche in the book . skip this one  you are not missing anything .  

=======================================================================================================

300 ===> murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made  for  tv but isn  t . considering the only actor of any note is bullock  although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things   it isn  t a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things . like . . . remembering to lock your front door when you go out . or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower .  br    br   bullock plays cassie mayweather  a cop with personal issues  don  t they all  . together with her new partner  a wet  looking ben chaplin   she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman . nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they  ve planned and executed the perfect murder . as the investigation continues  a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood  ryan gosling  .  br    br   the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless . bullock  though she is very nice to look at  is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield  actually  he  d be better   . chaplin  for his sins  is a complete non  entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood . at least gosling and pitt  as the conniving sneering suspects  acquit themselves adequately . as if dodgy leads weren  t bad enough  a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable  but illogical  ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run .  br    br    murder by numbers  has absolutely nothing going for it  even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn  t redeem it . well  just a little but still not enough to save it . forgettable  predictable and redundant  this is one film that isn  t going to move the cop genre forward . as cassie probably says on her next case  there  s nothing to see here people . move along  keep moving . . .  

=======================================================================================================

301 ===> i love the movies and own the comics  the comics are different then the movie but still i  d give it   out of   . it was awesome . if the movies got anymore awesome . i would have her babies . and i am female . read the comics you won  t regret it . yes in this movie since brian p . the artist for her died we don  t get nearly as good artistic work . i mean seriously don  t get me wrong these people did great  but different versions for different people . different strokes for different folks as the saying goes . any guy who doesn  t go bonkers over her is insane  or does not like women  or you know just plan insane . if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure  but hey there is always toes .  

=======================================================================================================

302 ===> although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death .  br    br   i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance .  br    br   the animation was ok  i got the sense of the    s anime from it which is what set it off for me . why everyone else hates that is beyond me .  br    br   character development was fine . i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around . for you who don  t like it  obviously wasn  t paying attention . lucifer tells you how it happens  and she used his words .  br    br   creamtor was a nice mentor  soldier for her . his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie .  br    br   i think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider . cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d  

=======================================================================================================

303 ===> at first the movie seemed to be doing great  they had the characters profiles set . . . the plot seemed to be going in the right direction . . . however  as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things . . . or just a lot was edited from the movie . the characters  identities changed for the worse within the movie . also  there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning   in other words   they had things within the movie that didn  t seem to fit the movie itself . and the title . . . no where in the movie does the title fit the movie . . . i suppose the title works for the previews . . . . actors did well with what they had . . . . . if they had a better director and writer  maybe this would have worked out better . but it didn  t . so now there  s a new terrible movie coming out this friday . . . . my opinion  . . . . don  t waste your time or money .  

=======================================================================================================

304 ===> so  i  m wondering while watching this film  did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock  s wardrobe by dragging out her  before  clothes from miss congeniality  did ms . bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the  before  gracie hart  as many reviewers have noted before  the film is very formulaic . add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest .  br    br   the two bad boy serial killers have been done before  and better  in other films . as has the  good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence  character been seen before . in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes .  br    br   one last peeve  using the term serial killer is false advertising . murdering one person  even if it  s a premeditated murder  does not make you a serial killer . you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer .  

=======================================================================================================

305 ===> in my years of attending film festivals  i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution  and they end up in the   bins at walmart . i just found dvd of yank tanks there  great doc  but how sad for it to end up as a rock  bottom remainder .  br    br   i loved this film  wish i  d seen it at the cinema in it  s everything . i  d have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly . it  s good for americans to stretch a little . if the film  s title helps the us audience to explore random chaos  all the better . cinema imitates life  visa versa .  br    br   also  i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars . come on  the euro is not hard to figure out  make the gringo audiences do the math . seeing a film  especially one shot in paris  the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me .  br    br   looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer  director as well .  

=======================================================================================================

306 ===> this film has renewed my interest in french cinema . the story is enchanting  the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful . i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie .  

=======================================================================================================

307 ===> alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think ofhe set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him .  br    br   the main subject of this bullock vehicle  all the ideas  almost everything was already in hitchcock  s classic  rope  the two students who commit a gratuitous crime  nietsche  s philosophy  and the clues that the boys disseminate  the master was the first to transfer them to the screen . and with an eighty  minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force .  br    br    murder by numbers  does not take place in a single room  like  the rope   mind you . and  what a supreme originality  it pits two cops against the evil youngstersand  you would never guess it  these two cops are very differentactually  bullock plays the part of woman living like a man  and her partner  chaplin  is as shy as a clueless girlie . the two boys  performances are not really mind  boggling  not as good  as  say  that of edward norton in  primal fear  .  br    br   well  you know   rope  was so good . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

308 ===> there  s something frustrating about watching a movie like  murder by numers  because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out . however  by the time the credits roll  there  s no saving it . the whole thing is pretty much blown by the  cop side  of the story  where sandra bullock and ben chaplin  s homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on . although bullock is strong in her role  it  s not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing . ben chaplin  s talents are wasted in a forgettable role  he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated  birthday girl   as well as chris penn  who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him . anyway  the plot really isn  t even a factor in this movie at all . the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie . their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well . it  s too bad they weren  t in a much better all  around film . barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker . bottom line it  s worth a rent if you  re a genre fan  but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it  except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks .

309 ===>   happenstance  is the most new york  feeling parisian film i  ve seen since  when the cat  s away  chacun cherche son chat  .   br    br   a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for  amelie   its french title is more apt  le battement d  ailes du papillon  the beating of the butterfly  s wings   as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives .  br    br   tatou  s gamine  ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures  and because she  s part of a large  multi  ethnic ensemble  so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters  especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me  and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i wasn  t sure if they were doing that or not .  br    br   but i loved how urban the coincidences were  from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafs .  br    br   the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once .  br    br    originally written

310 ===>   stargate sg    follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg   through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole .  br    br   having seen this series sporadically for it  s first few seasons when it first came out  i didn  t know how good this series would really be    years after i had last seen an episode . my old impression was that the series was great  but my impression was far from the truth .  stargate sg    is more than just a simple sci  fi series  it is one of the most well made  interesting  long running  exciting sci  fi ever produced . and why  because it runs on an amazing premise .  br    br   this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television  as a medium  with a suitable premise  is able to provide something that doesn  t work on the time restriction of film . the sense of familiarity created by a long running series  watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief  and it  s all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show .  br    br    stargate sg    kept offering great adventures throughout the   years  but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show  br    br    the first few seasons  perhaps up to the  th   th  focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations  keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul  d threat .  br    br    from the  th to the  th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul  d and preventing attacks on earth . after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg   in a place of goaul  d  replicator  ori conflicts  br    br    the  th season is probably the most mixed one . it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned  but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments .  br    br    the  th and   th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o  neil . they are both good continuations  although the first few episodes of the   th season are a little weak  because they seem to be about little more than sg   and human  jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori .  br    br   basically  after season   exploration was pushed to the background  which in many ways was a shame  because of the potential and mystery each planet  episode  presented on the other hand  it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were .  br    br   even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest  the feeling i have is that it could go on the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer . a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome  but ultimately things are as they are .  br    br   in the end  because of the fact that i enjoyed everything  it  s a little hard to find that it ends . the big picture  however  the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of   years  is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew  those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg   .  

=======================================================================================================

311 ===> lets enter the world of this movie for a second  so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here .  br    br   edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose       bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars  shouting at them  and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him . . . . . . instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief . . . . instead of just walking up and pop  . . . . . what do you do  the bad guy . . . . . he talks to him . he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun . they have nothing to talk about  shoot him  shoot him now  but he talks to him anyway . oh another thing . at the end  a newspaper says  pulitzer prize winner story right here  or something right above on a front page of a paper  when its like the first time the story is printed . so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast  yea  you know those types of stupid movies  yea well that  s edison in a nutshell .  br    br   you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely  ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie  while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places  and who  s last line  duck  was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made . . . and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks  little cocky bastard . the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best  denzel from training day  impression  which was pretty entertaining .  br    br   oh yea so whats the movie about  eh  something about scandals involving the city edison  s fictional special unit police force called  f . r . a . t .  i swear i  m not making this stuff up  which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s . w . a . t . anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving  undercover cops from frat  and he goes scurrying off looking for a story  gaining his boss   freeman  trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought . blah blah blah . its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day . the pacing was slow and off  the script was horrible  and the acting was extremely uninspired . it jumped everywhere without going anywhere . people get put in comas and you forget about them . everyone in this movie just didn  t think . damn what a stupid movie . its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended . . . no lie basically  do not waste your time   

=======================================================================================================

312 ===> hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse        and now only seems to do  by the numbers  hollywood thrillers .  br    br   this is very lightweight john grisham material  crossed with the plot of a tv movie . bullock is cass mayweather  a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers . ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy  and together they make an uncomfortable duo . not good  when two unbalanced college maladriots  gosling and pitt  decide to send them on a wild goose chase  by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene .  br    br   fair enough  but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks  we also have to endure a several dull overly  melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass  s history . then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff  side log cabin where there  s absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set . oooh . . . the atmosphere .  br    br   watch any episode of csi instead . it  s to the point and far more exciting .  

=======================================================================================================

313 ===> narratives  whether written  visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers  after all  can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who . this is especially true in film  i think  simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema . viewers like myself  however  don  t have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhs .  br    br   a year ago i was introduced to audrey tautou  a french actress  whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain       and later in a very long engagement        both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters . this earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity .  br    br   now  other directors have used those techniques before robert altman with the player        short cuts        gosford park       and others paul thomas anderson did the same with magnolia       . stanley kramer did it with a mad  mad  mad  mad world in      a comedy of almost epic proportions . the difference with this film is  first the director lets us  see  inside the head of some of the characters and second  some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer  s memory as the story flip  flops between different time periods .  br    br   the basic  the core  so to speak  story concerns a young woman  irene  tautou  who is told  by a fellow commuter on a train  that she will meet her true love on that day . this occurs in the first few minutes of the film . the clever irony at this point is that irene doesn  t realize that the young man opposite  gilbert robin  may be that  one true love  . and  nor does he . . .  br    br   they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter . however  chaos results throughout the rest of the day  not only for the two young people  but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere  and yet . . .  br    br   if the story were simply that  it could tend to be boring  and even quite predictable . not so . the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace  but which are turned into believable  extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again . for example  the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours  consider your alternatives two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again . or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen  consider again what would happen . . .  br    br   all of that is interesting enough . what was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene  or whether it was  in fact  the young man on the train . that kept me guessing for a while .  br    br   i  ll let you think about that  should you see this delightful romp .  br    br   recommended for all .  

=======================================================================================================

314 ===> this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment  its the best ending of any movie i  ve ever seen . perfect  beautiful  funny  simply wonderful .  br    br   i found this movie delightful  even with it  s french taking  itself  too  seriously deep meanings thing going on . i loved it  it  s a great love story . and i loved the way algerians were woven in  and by the way  the music during the final credits is great . i want the cd   

=======================================================================================================

315 ===> they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station . they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived . you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot  four young boys playing in grainy slow motion  accompanied by voice over narration . next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion . once they  re grown  it  s easy to spot the writer  director among the four . he  s the quiet  contemplative  long  haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants . this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood . only there  s no writing  or directing talent on display here . and if you still can  t figure out which one he is  here  s a hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name . it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty  something men were supposed to still be in high school . what looked like a prison was apparently a high school  the warden turned out to be the principal . once more  the poor  misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement  murder and pillage  but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father . how about hitting back  kid  like you do everyone else  numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose . howlingly bad dialogue . many scenes badly out of focus . cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras  drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience . overacting in the extreme . and if you don  t quite get the self  important speeches  or the slow  motion scenes  just listen to the overbearing music . it will clue you in and what you  re supposed to feel . poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films . the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies  run over puppies chained to a tree  rob and steal  all the while complaining about their sad  sorry lives . but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college . yeah  that  s the ticket . why is it that every twenty  something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important  so interesting  that the world can  t wait to see it onscreen  if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems  then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants .  

=======================================================================================================

316 ===> a lot of people seemed to have liked the film  so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review . but after sitting through   minutes of it  i feel i have to do so . where the heck is the plot in this film   i must have missed it  i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened . sure the ending was  somewhat shocking  but they didn  t build up to it . i forgot who was who half of the time  so they didn  t really develop the characters . the acting was so  so  most of the time it was believable  but i was able to see through it most of the time . so . . . without giving anything away  i must say that unless you like the actors in the film  there is no real reason to watch this movie . i could be mistaken  but i just didn  t understand why there was so little  or too much of the film . i can  t decide which one that would be  so i say judge for yourselves . i don  t even know if renting it would be a good idea  the cost and all . . .  br    br   plot     characters     acting     overall     i feel like that  s too high really  i am staying with my vote up at the top .  

=======================================================================================================

317 ===> to me  this review may contain spoilers  but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen  so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers   br    br   i just watched this movie again  and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie . ever . ever . ever . the real translation   the beating of the butterfly  s wings   is oddly not used as the translated title . i suppose they thought most americans wouldn  t know what chaos theory is  except for those who saw or read  jurassic park   . the movie is based on chaos theory  and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events  which all lead back to one event . the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect  as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters  about     . in a way  the ending seems inevitable despite this  but if you think about it  it is a perfect ending . think to yourself   what else needed to be said   it is at the same time a very brave ending . too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one  but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood .  br    br

318 ===> most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character  it is not really audrey tautou  s real life personality  hence  every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part   part   etc .  br    br   now with that said  i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it . yes  it  s true  there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn  t seen at all for maybe   min  but i didn  t even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters . the guy who lies about everything is too funny  the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss  actually . . . . getting into all the characters here could take quite a while  but this is one of the best movies i  ve seen in a while .  br    br   audrey tautou  s character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was . in fact  as irene  her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first . in this film  irene is a girl with good intentions  but over the course of a  very awful  day  her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic .  br    br   what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building . . . very entertaining to watch  great scenery and shots  very colorful and never too slow  and all of the characters can actually act . the best part of the movie comes with about   minutes left . . . . this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense  and the whole butterfly effect blossoms . i swear  it was the best   minutes of film i  ve seen in quite a while  and the ending . . . . it made me think  damn i really lucked out finding this movie  . the ending to this movie is top notch . whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant  because not only are there all these other subplots going on  but to somehow make them all tie in together  and in a sensible manner  which is the case here  but also to make each character feel human and come alive  not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect . . . very impressive .  br    br   i highly suggest this movie as it  s a great film to watch anytime  in any mood  with any company or alone .

319 ===> a horribly pointless and  worse  boring film . stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything  no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes  and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way .  br    br   will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey  s truman show  and substitutes his usual shouting routine  admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights  for  well  pretty much nothing .  br    br   emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating  that some reviews i  ve read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable  whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy . please . that she ended up falling for ferrell  s  character  is utterly ludicrous .  br    br   marc forster  s attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with .  br    br   i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this . i wish i  d opted for the prestige .  

=======================================================================================================

320 ===> stranger than fiction angered me so much  i signed up on imdb just to write this review . stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex  touching and thought  provoking movie until the very end . once you suspend multiple lapses of logic  why didn  t will ferrell hear emma thompson  s voice   years ago when she fist started writing her book   the phone rang . the phone rang again .  how could she not know it  s him calling  etc .   the movie challenges one  s thoughts about mortality  fate  and sacrifice .  br    br   the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors . and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure  even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul . her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith .  br    br   ah  but the ending . until the very end  i would have given  out of   stars to this movie . the movie as a metaphor for life  s journey  as a tribute to the notion of  writing true   as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy  but not both  is outstanding . the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrell  s fate . and no matter how endearing a character he may have become  we know full well why we will accept the ending . the last act occurs  the screen goes white  the credits roll . a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film . an end that would have been debated for weeks .  br    br   no           no credits rolled . say it isn  t so . say hollywood didn  t tack on another   minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie . dustin hoffman got it right when he said   it  s no longer a masterpiece it  s ok .  an apt review of the movie . except to me  it wasn  t even ok . i was so offended about the betrayal of  writing true   about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie . i don  t often cry . i could care less about most movies  but i am still angry about this one .  br    br   my questions for zack helm  the writer  are this did the original movie end when the screen went white  and were you forced by the vapid movie powers  that  be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie  or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself  i  ve read you  re brilliant . i hope your original script ended the movie the first time .  br    br   i know zack helm will never see this review  and i  ve been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself . but  please  movie  goers  am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction  one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now .

321 ===> the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific . according to this theory  somehow related to the chaos theory  i  m not sure exactly how   every action  no matter how small or insignificant  will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events . this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly  unrelated characters  most of them in paris  whose actions will affect each others  lives .  the six  degrees  of  separation theory can be applied as well .  each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film . the acting is finely  tuned and nuanced  audrey tautou is luminous   the stories mesh plausibly  the humor is just right  and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement .  

=======================================================================================================

322 ===> we have to remember that the    s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies . hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies  noir  two reel oaters  etc to movies with a message . we had blackboard jungle  on the waterfront and so on . some folks might think that was an improvement . i don  t . who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message  call western union  he was right . these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy .  br    br   this one is a pip . it  s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father  s estate . one of them  maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay . he  s initially in it for the bucks  but eventually falls for her . meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance . the results are predictable . you get a little bit of everything in this movie . sexual tension between the sisters . a little subtle masochism . hereditary insanity  if there is such a thing . we never get to meet the parents  but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown . one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar . the acting is so bad it  s hard to believe . it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel  air productions . it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits . the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke . it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene .  br    br   i can  t explain it  not even to myself  but i gave this pile of trash an     . i  m familiar with the term  it  s so bad it  s good   but i don  t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before . well  maybe  hot rods to hell   but this one certainly fits . you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody  s basement .  

=======================================================================================================

323 ===> spoilers contained  br    br   i  d heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific . what i didn  t expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go . what starts off as a typical cowboy  indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic  comedy  about honus  soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss  and cresta  candice bergen  who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne . the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit . donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason . they then escape and both turn up  separately  at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base . as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them . so far so ordinary . then comes the ending . after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they  won  t they get together storyline  the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head . similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn  t resort to extreme gratuitous violence . in some ways  soldier blue reminds me of frank perry  s last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending . i didn  t hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending . if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents  i would recommend elem klimov  s come and see .  

=======================================================================================================

324 ===> soldier blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man  s inhumanity to man  on the white man  s exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting  unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam . well  sorry  but it fails miserably to be any of those things . what soldier blue actually is is pernicious  trite  badly made  dishonest rubbish .  br    br   another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies . what it is basically is a lame  clichd  poorly acted  odd couple  romance  strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other  s lifestyle and falling in love  ah  bless   bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn  t have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick .  br    br   there is no excuse for the repulsive  prurient  gore  drenched climax  in which cute little native american children are variously shot  sliced  dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close  up  and large  breasted native american women are molested  raped and strung up  no excuse  that is  except box office .  the massacre itself  whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention  is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them  intercut with a few special  effects sequences of beheading  dismemberment  dismemberments  incidentally  which utilised real amputees in their filming . now that  s what i call exploitation .   br    br   forget all the pap you  ve heard  including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie  about this being a  protest   an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples . this film doesn  t give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters  would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless  faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax . instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss  lousy actors both  in this at least   with plenty of blood  guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious .  br    br   which is a terrible shame  because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre  about all of the real life massacres the us  and britain  and all so  called  civilised  nations  have participated in over the centuries  iraq   . this just isn  t that movie .  

=======================================================================================================

325 ===> the first and second seasons started off shakily  with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones  and at times resorting to clichd stories . but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it  s characters more  it became a lot more fun and entertaining .  br    br   the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson  peter deluise  joseph malozzie and paul mullie . richard  s dry sense of humour makes to show so much better  peter  s directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining  and joe  paul never fail to make a funny  interesting episode together .  br    br   once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters  i doubt you won  t like the show . for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes  the other side   a good serious episode  and  window of opportunity   a classic comic relief episode .  

=======================================================================================================

326 ===> that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say .  it  s funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally  too .  only two of the sisters are really bad . boy  are they bad  too  one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e  er she goes . the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe . she has those sensual  slightly parted lips . and  not to give anything away  she is even more bad than the other .  br    br   all three sisters are played by starlets . the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield . he had something of a career .  br    br   this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft  core porn ever marketed . well  of course not the first but the raciest at that time .  br    br   the girls wear as little as possible and let  s not forget about the female audience members bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor   whose fetish was this    bare  chested . he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit .  br    br   there  s a real plot here  too the girls  family  see  is cursed . they are prone to suicide   or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide .  br    br   the movie is not bad . i truly don  t know where it was shown . maybe it was made for drive  ins . somehow  and i could be wrong  i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here . the women are scantily dressed . they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novels .  br    br   but the guy seems to be the central focus . not everyone in the movie likes him  but all the girls love him . and i think the audience is meant to also .  br    br   it  s lots of fun   and on its own terms  too .  

=======================================================================================================

327 ===> first of all  this film can be divided into three segments . a promising opening  with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne . this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section  with the totally miscast candice bergen and  soldier blue  traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison . miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth  and looks like she just walked out of a     s jack nicholson movie . i mean she maintains zero interest  with zero believability . the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village . this is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti  war propaganda  that it comes across as simply long  outrageous  and contrived . not recommended .  merk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jacobe  comment above  here  s an idea . why don  t you actually watch the movie you are commenting on  instead of chirping your liberal nonsense . this is not a political site  it is for reviewing films .  merk

328 ===> when sam peckinpah  s superlative the wild bunch       opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra  violence  it did so with a talented  if whisky  marinated  hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth  but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah  s epic  and soldier blue definitely falls into that category .  br    br   soldier blew  er  blue tells the story of foul  mouthed new yorker cresta lee  candice bergen  a blonde proto  hippie chick who  s been  rescued  from two years of  captivity  among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she  ll be reunited with the fiance she only wants to marry for his money . also on board the wagon she  s traveling in is a shipment of government gold  cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with  so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills  accompanied by honus gant  peter strauss   the lone surviving cavalryman . calling gant by the snarky nickname  soldier blue   cresta demonstrates that her years among the  savages  was time well spent  outstripping gant in survival skills  common sense  and sheer balls  and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements  a band of hostile kiowa  an unscrupulous trader  played by donald pleasance  here giving one of his most ridiculous performances  and that  s saying something  and  in the tradition of many previous western  set romantic comedies  each other .  br    br   during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while gant has a freshly  treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg  no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn  t filled with rattlesnakes  mountain lions  or who knows what  to say nothing of the cheyenne  who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment  there i go  thinking in nyc real estate terms again  .  br    br   realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave  cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won  t spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village  and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby  to  be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what  s coming .  br    br   what happens next is what gained the film its infamy it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead  in to a hideous reenactment of the     sand creek massacre  an orgy of rape  torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of  keeping the country clean   and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty . children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets  unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect  i have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes  then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight  so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts  which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered  their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs . no joke  this scene would instantly garner an nc    rating if released today  to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted .  br    br   i  m all in favor of westerns that don  t shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won  or stolen if truth be told  but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute it  s a heavy  handed pseudo  hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up  well  duh    then it  s a light  hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho  with no undies   but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally    hilarious pair of buck  toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub  plot that goes nowhere  all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax . any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film  but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film  s promotion and poster imagery .  br    br   but by trying to be all things to all audiences  soldier blue ends up as an incoherent  preachy mulligan stew of presumably well  intentioned political correctness  but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre  wouldn  t it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk  ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece  we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing  the most savage film in history .  if you  like me  were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its  daring to tell it like it was   take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity .

329 ===> the unlikely duo of zero mostel and harry belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the angel levine . it  s one interesting twist on the themes from it  s a wonderful life .  br    br   zero is married to ida kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york . mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade  but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working . kaminsky is mostly bedridden . he  s reduced to applying for welfare . in desperation like jimmy stewart  he cries out to god for some help .  br    br   now maybe if he had gotten someone like henry travers things might have worked out differently  but even stewart had trouble accepting travers . but travers had one thing going for him  he was over    years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone . god sent mostel something quite different  the recently deceased harry belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment .  br    br   belafonte hasn  t accepted he  s moved on from life  he  s still got a lot of issues . he also has a wife  gloria foster  who doesn  t know he  s passed on  hit by a car right at the beginning of the film . you put his issues and mostel  s issues and you  ve got a good conflict  starting with the fact that mostel can  t believe in a black jew named levine .  br    br   this was the farewell performance for polish  jewish actress ida kaminsky who got a nomination for best actress in the shop on main street a few years back . the other prominent role here is that of irish actor milo o  shea playing a nice jewish doctor . remembering o  shea  s brogue from the verdict  i was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor .  br    br   the angel levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society . it  s brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer bernard malamud . make sure to catch it when broadcast .  

=======================================================================================================

330 ===> some spoilers  br    br   i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms  acting  dated dialogue  unclear storyline  unfounded . belafonte is great as a brandoesque  menacing  swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill  equipped from his past life to do so . he learns too late how empty his hustling  materialistic life was without love . mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny . in spite of his prayers for a miracle  his bitterness prevents him from accepting  or believing  in one . the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other  the result being hilarious and touchingly sad .  br    br   the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film . after looking everywhere for belafonte  mostel looks up to see a falling feather  and he frantically reaches for it as if he  s finally willing to believe in angels and miracles . but belafonte wasn  t allowed to finish his miracle  either to restore fanny  s health or mostel  s faith   so he never got his wings . the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel  s grasp  a metaphor for both men  s live it  s too late and you don  t get a second chance . like  it  s a wonderful life   this movie is magical  wonderful  funny  but terribly tragic .  

=======================================================================================================

331 ===> i remembered the title so well . to me  it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles . and it had vincent massey  s voice from behind whiskers . well flora robson was great . her next signature  for me  would be    days at peking  . the same role but with different sumptuous gowns . and the same voice . as for the armada  it was a subtext . i like black  and  white films . was everything done in elizbethan times at night  it was talky and difficult to fathom  at times . i couldn  t tell which was the love interest . was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh  and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada . apparently it worked for the empire  but not for the script . this might have been more accurate  historically  but bette davis had more engaging scripts . and i missed daylight   

=======================================================================================================

332 ===> spoilers  br    br   well  the one line summary says it all . melvilles  le samurai  is the original and there are elements of  leon  . and they are better  much better   br    br   in the  samurai  alain delon is a lonely warrior  professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs  with so much suspense in these scenes   . even the end is exactly the same the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand . the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it .  br    br   delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog . but i guess jarmusch liked  leon  very much or even  desperado  by rodriguez . so he added this  too . and let me guess the girl will become a professional like ghost dog  like natalie portman in  leon     br    br   so what was jarmusch thinking after all  where is the unique  the original thought in this movie   br    br   i cant see the point in making carbon  celluloid  copies .  br    br   a     rating by macaulay connor  

=======================================================================================================

333 ===> i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film   br    br   as it  s obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it  or were stupid enough to pay to see it .  br    br   the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back . elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can .  br    br   it  s an ok monster flick  compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made . way better      

=======================================================================================================

334 ===> i was around  when i saw this movie first . it wasn  t so special then  but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun  a lot   br    br   i think the best parts of the film are yeti  s body language and the  special effects  also .  br    br   if you wanna watch this movie  don  t wait for a hollywood made blockbuster  even this film was made from approx .     dollars    br    br   i  ve a copy of it . movie and video version as well  but i don  t think it had been ever shown in cinemas   br    br   watch it  enjoy it    yeti for ever     

=======================================================================================================

335 ===>   don  t bother to watch this film  would be better advice  if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles . this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast  not just marilyn .  br    br   the story was just nothing  certainly nothing like described on the vhs box  of course . there simply was no suspense  precious little excitement and too many dull spots  most of them trying to show why  nellie   monroe  was so messed up . this was not a good role for monroe  even though i didn  t need to see this character to know she could act .  some like it hot  alone was good enough evidence for me . but this role just didn  t fit her and it  s no surprise it wasn  t one of her more popular films .  br    br   it  s also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark  anne bancroft  elisha cook jr .  jeanne cagney  donna cocoran and others .  br    br   summary it  s not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game .

336 ===> this is a well  worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman  s noose  then sets about  taming  his reluctant bride . it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time . we never find out  for example  why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband . or why the members of her team are so eager to get a  real man  in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own . this only made sense in fifties hollywood .  br    br   there  s a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip   the second time   then yanks her off her horse . never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye  which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip  then  he prevails in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp . that  s some second wind . later  he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty indians  as they all are in these flicks  after they reject her now she  s his  squaw  . never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she  s been negotiating with them for years . and the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him   yeah  right . like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail .  br    br   finally  neither of the leads is convincing in their roles . madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky . fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot  but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy . the only reason you  d root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film  s end . the way that madison tames fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow  up dolls . even if you do see them as dolls  the total lack of suspense will bore you .  br    br   total waste of time . even the scenery  s kinda dull . give this one a big miss .

337 ===> being a giant monster fan  me seeing  yeti  was an absolute must  especially after hearing so much about it . thanks to the good  ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily  and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually  dare i say  decent .  br    br   decent for what it is  actually  namely a cheesy giant  monster flick . it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately  and we get introduced to various characters . they consist of some sleazy ones  some good ones  and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci  fi film  by far .  br    br   yeti looks like a long  haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert  and really  he  s not that bad of a dude  especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage  like thing . godzilla he is not  despite his rude awakening  he doesn  t even rampage  actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture   but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out . yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely  my copy was dubbed in english  and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are .  br    br   however  we want to see the giant yeti do his thing  and he  s pretty much in the whole movie  and in typical low  budget fashion  he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there  s even a bunch of the  fake legs  shots of him just standing there .  br    br   yes  the special effects aren  t the greatest  but there are definitely some good ones here . a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well  and in another  he uses the windows of a building as  ladder steps  to climb down from the top of it  shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside  in one sequence that really looks much  much better than it should in such a  bad  movie .  br    br    yeti  never stoops as low as say   a . p . e .  does . actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti  s nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an  oh yeah baby  manner . but even this isn  t that bad  and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer .  br    br   the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing  but surprisingly enough it doesn  t get boring  the story is actually good  and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy .  br    br    yeti  may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks  but it is definitely better than other king kong    rip  offs like  a . p . e .  and  queen kong  by very far .

338 ===> yeti deserves the  star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made . i saw it at a midnight screening in l . a . and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity  this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does  the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill  fitting suit  the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen  and yes  there is a mute boy  who sorta kinda looks like a girl  and he  s mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents  hmmm  maybe therapy for the kid    . then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti  once he thaws  which takes forever    and he is instantly in love with her  what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes  bedroom eyes  at her  it  s like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie . in fact  once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest  she accidentally touches the yeti  s nipple and yes  the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard     yikes of all yikes  plus there  s a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie  there  s also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish  keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl  s hair  gee  thanks yeti  now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout . you  re the best .  this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up . if you are a fan of classic cinema crap  seek this baby out .  

=======================================================================================================

339 ===> i  m basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night          . i don  t think i  ll be watching again . the acting was totally wooden  the plot completely predictable  the ending totally unrealistic   i mean who would believe a   million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer  the lead actor  victor garber  seemed so uncomfortable  almost embarrassed in his role   perhaps he realized how bad the writing was   i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor  but they can surely find better writers . maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china   i  ll bet we won  t be seeing this one next season   

=======================================================================================================

340 ===> beginning with the poster  featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey   the entire movie was a fraud . one stereotype after another  this movie was about nothing  or nothing new  at least . after      minutes  you realize that you  ve just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop  flick .  br    br   basically  the story is about the corrupt system in some city  all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town  under the watchful eye of some hot  shot politician . the almighty and above  the  law organization is called frat and guess what  they  ve got a kick  ass loony cop shooting and beating at will  suspects  girlfriends  you name it . frat cops are corrupt and greedy  so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented      journalist . one hour later  after a series of unbelievably bad  made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines  everything ends happily and we get served the final line  you can  t beat the system . bah  don  t see this waste of film roll . freeman and spacey barely have   min altogether   

=======================================================================================================

341 ===> people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs  congo  king kong vs . godzilla  king kong        they all ripoff one another  but yeti stands on its own . it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal  s attraction with one female .  br    br   the yeti myth is based on bigfoot  not like king kong  and archeologists have been fascinated it  at one time they did exist  but there is no scientific data to prove it .  br    br   this movie is hard to find  but its worth watching it . the first time i watched it was on  elvira  s mistress of the dark shows  in the early      s . it sent chills down my spine as a kid  especially when the yeti got mad . i saw it again  around     am on abc about  to  yrs ago . seeing it again made me appreciate it more  it has some overall good effects  for its time  and the story involves a mute boy and his dog  and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes . also the music is pretty cool  its very yeti like .     br    br   gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere .  br    br   vote  and half out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

342 ===> here  s another movie that should be loaded into a satellite  fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity . this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip  off of the already bad movie classic king kong from     that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness  but successfully predicted much of peter jackson  s miserable     computer cartoon bearing the same name  as far as a  romance  between the giant  here a yeti  and a gorgeous human female  antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi  s city of the living dead  who is very easy on the eyes  .  br    br   the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex   the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package  the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness . but as a trade  off you do get a wacky old scientist  two inquisitive kids  tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain  a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure  dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while  and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti  who turns out to be the good guy  glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands  a monster who  s size literally changes scale from shot to shot  some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison  crowd reaction shots a  plenty made up of either spanish  italian or canadian extras depending upon scene  you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed   and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie .  br    br   it  s here that the film won me over it  s enthusiasm just for being made . frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in     and god  s gun the year before this  was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action  adventure genre film scene from the      s       s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work . i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever  or rather the one he took the most chances with  and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families . the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless . or rather they are part of the fun  and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn  t have worked   which is exactly why peter jackson  s movie sucked .  br    br   he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators  and with all it  s faults  clunkiness  kramer  s yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this  which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages  not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space . i  d rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it  curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever . because the movie looks so  fake  you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked  trampled  tossed about and smashed . knowing that and armed with a fertile  energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie  parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend . this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid .  br    br         it  s about ten minutes too long but who cares  you only come around once and i  d rather go out with a smile on my face .  

=======================================================================================================

343 ===> frankly i  m rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering . have they all been written by his pals  the action clunks along  the music is irritating and over used  the script is simply dire and the actors  with the exception of the gardener  mediocre at best . i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it  s brilliant when it  s not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i . e . continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture . yes  it  s his first film  low budget etc .  i get it  but it  s also out there for members of the public to purchase and it  s just not up to scratch .  

=======================================================================================================

344 ===> it  s one of those dramas that  s so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny  the script is absolutely dire  direction appalling  lighting purely armature  the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it  s good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard  but doesn  t at least destroy any speeches . there  s continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout . and finally last but not least the acting is appalling . for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this .  

=======================================================================================================

345 ===> i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies  but all of them failed to meet my expectations . . . until now  burning paradise doesn  t contain the flat humor most hk movies have  nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film . the story is not complex  but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some  intelligent  space  the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger  but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me  . there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie  from the first one  which is one of the coolest i have ever seen  yet so short  to the last main scenes  but mind  there  s also a lot of blood that flows  people cut in half  decapitated  etc  . the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical  notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall   . yep  it  s not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film  it  s ringo lam  and i  m sure as hell going to check out more from this director  ace .  

=======================================================================================================

346 ===>   br    br    burning paradise  is a combination of neo  shaw brothers action and ringo lam  s urban cynicism . when one watches the film  they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn  t matter  it  s attitude and atmosphere that counts . this great film has both   always trying to be different than his contemporaries  lam gives us to traditional heroes  fong sai  yuk and hung shi  kwan  and puts them in a  raiders of the lost ark  setting . however  these are not the light  hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie . instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results . what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime  there is no holding back . too bad  they don  t make films like this more often .  

=======================================================================================================

347 ===> i  ll keep this short thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl  s drink  imprisons and tortures her  then poses as a captive to have sex with her . that is the single twist and punchline of the film . it  s torture as slow motion date rape . and  it  s not even a good movie . it  s not so bad it  s good it  s just bad .  br    br   it should also be mentioned that among critics  there is a  spoiler code  that they dare not break  even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile . why no one had the cojones to step up and say   this is garbage  and this is why   is beyond me .  br    br   don  t give your money to these poop  peddlers .  

=======================================================================================================

348 ===> the only reason i give it a  is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on .  br    br   this film is asinine . it  s like so many other   st century grind house fodder . the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting . i didn  t care about any of the characters  but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap i  d complain about the money i spent  but my date and i wisely left after   minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining  live free or die hard   which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of  captivity  for   minutes .  

=======================================================================================================

349 ===> hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones . the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers . as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes . where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure . sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood .  

=======================================================================================================

350 ===> this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong  s  new wave  that began with tsui hark  s  zu warriors of magic mountain  . tsui set a tone for the new wave  s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave  jackie chan  sammo hung  wong jing  ching siu tung  etc .  accepted from then on as a given namely  the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony  if not outright comedy .  burning paradise  put a stop to all that  and with a vengeance .  br    br   it  s not that there isn  t humor here but it is a purely human humor  as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw . but this is just as humans are  not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time .  br    br   when irony is at last introduced into the film  it is the nastiest possible  emanating from the  abbot  of red lotus temple  who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before . he is the very incarnation of milton  s satan from  paradise lost    better to rule in hell than serve in heaven   and if he can  t get to satan  s hell soon enough  he  ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule .  br    br   that  s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here it  s not that the abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair  to feel utterly hopeless  to accept his nihilism as all  encompassing reality . thus there  s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself  it has become all there is to the universe  and the abbot  claiming mastery of infinite power  is in charge .  br    br   of course  fortunately  the film doesn  t end there . though there are losses  the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails .  if you want to know how  see the film   yet there is no doubt that  in viewing this film  we visit hell . hopefully  we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience  and somehow better for it over all .  

=======================================================================================================

351 ===> the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor  a holocaust survivor  part of mengele  s experiments on twins  consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz  and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments . the movie obviously had great reviews . it  s one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about .  br    br   i too  for a large part of the movie  got sucked into the emotion that the movie  maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on . one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder  obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum  could only find the sweetest nectar .  in one of the many dramatic sequences  as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center  the meaning of the word  forgive  is even debated  but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own  but by this time  the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more . after the  strong  willed  eva kor forgives her  nazi captors  the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about  at least from the viewpoint of kor . the movie goes about following her  past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory . to me  this was the meat of the movie  surrounded by inedible fat of her  act of forgiveness  . obviously  it was a very sick cow .  br    br   on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness  in order to heal wounds of the past  she makes her way to the  promised land  to meet with some arabs  to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis  including one at a jewish center in chicago . from then on  anyone not so teary eyed that they can  t see the screen will find it hard  pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements .  br    br   firstly  you immediately notice her body language  defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers . her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time  effort and money the entire act was . a rather annoyed dr sami advan  professor of education at bethlehem university  gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment .  br    br   finally  the debate at the jewish center in chicago  where she is  grilled  on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so  in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts .  br    br   i will cut to the chase . by the end of the movie  i was hoping i hadn  t chosen to watch the movie . the movie was badly made  failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial  just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears . it showed that kor  the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion . her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness  at best  to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate .  br    br   lastly  is everyone so retarded today that they can  t notice the difference between making peace and forgiving  quoting another imdb user   i don  t see her forgiveness as being weak  quite the contrary  she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul  she wanted the suffering to be over  so she let it go .  that would be the perfect layman  s definition of making peace .  br    br   i guess  in a world of propaganda  blind faith and political correctness  there is no room to question those that have  gone through more than the human mind can fathom  .  br    br   p . s . the dictionary certainly should go into all those books  to  buy lists everyone keeps making .  

=======================================================================================================

352 ===> this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning  but never fleshed out to it  s expectations . the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas  typical of the asian directors   but doesn  t know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it . the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film  never finding a solid  explainable  interesting angle . basically  the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases . the acting was very good  however . all the actors gave good performances  and jude law was outstanding as he is always is . it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .  

=======================================================================================================

353 ===> i disagree with anyone who done  t like this movie .  br    br   i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do . it  s sweet  funny and warms your heart . and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed .  br    br   and even though it didn  t have much of a story  it was still excellent i give it a   and two thumbs up .  br    br   oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish  s and dreams can come true .  tear  tear   br    br   i love this movie  personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say  shame on you .  because it was a delightful little movie and i  m glad that at least some people liked it .  

=======================================================================================================

354 ===> this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years . i will sadly miss it . although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit .  br    br   the last ever episode of sg   on television anyway  was beautifully done . robert wrote something that felt close to reality . as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show .  everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up  s and downs . but over the years they  ve turned into a family  . i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else  s criticisms .  br    br   sg  was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement . the wonderful characters  stories  directors  writers . from episode one i was hooked . the blend of action  science  drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more .  br    br   there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me . i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years . it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible .  br    br   i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them . i never want the show to die .  br    br   stargate sg              

=======================================================================================================

355 ===> ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected  he did a fabulous job acting as a  renegade  cop within a  renegade  department . from the very beginning  he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he  s in . he acts as a sort of  gentle giant    a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody  yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start   and he does an amazing job . he was quite clearly the best character in the movie .  br    br   this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards . after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down . his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor   and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner . there are so many ways his character  moses ashford  could have taken a more pivotal role . that he didn  t was disappointing and a true let  down . i was hoping to see more from him in this film .  br    br   timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry . his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive . this movie is a typical action movie that  at least initially  bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past . being an action movie  it has its share of shoot  em  up scenes  blood  and guts . these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable . watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end   think of what you would typically expect in a good  cops  bad  cops conflict   and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot  out .  br    br   what irked me most was the way timberlake  s character behaved during shoot  out scenes . he starts out having guns and not using them . then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he  s been firing a gun his whole life . then he runs out of bullets and doesn  t have a gun   and   seconds later  without moving or anything   suddenly has  more fully loaded guns and extra ammo   little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me .  br    br   if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay  then you  ll probably love this movie . personally  it doesn  t matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic . make me believe that the story is true . this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied .

356 ===> i love all types of films  especially horror . that being said  survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it .  br    br   i can  t give it any points on originality . there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes  or remaking what others have done . it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods  a crazed killer  and as of lately  throw in some crazy family . on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw  wrong turn  though the twist in that one is obvious   and others . survival falls up way short against comparable films . the plot was just not original in any way . some films can get by with a weak  and way over  done  plot with superb acting  special fx  or a slew of other factors . survivial doesn  t have any of that to bank on . if you will  note the following the acting in the movie never took off . i don  t knock or blame the actors for that  nor the director . the dialogue was at best mediocre  and the actors involved never showed  not saying didn  t have  the talent to pull it off . i mention  standouts . the leading man in this film certainly has the look  but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film . the actor who portrayed greg also had potential  but we never got to see any of it  watch the movie to see why  you won  t believe it . .  .  br    br   the grainy film look . ah yes  that little tid  bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of  grindhouse  films . in today  s film making  that has become a gimmick . it either works or it doesn  t . in this case it just does not work . there are too many other flaws going on  so it winds up distracting from the film  not adding to it . that being said  i think they did a good job of adding that grain . that is some good  quality grain . i think with a different script  better direction  and possibly actors  they should try another  grindhouse  attempt . they will probably pull it off .  br    br   as far as the tech aspects  in my opinion  they never quite gelled for me either . better care could have been taken with audio  sounds like it was fed directly into the camera  but there is nothing wrong with that  and for being shot on dv  it was too soft for my taste .  br    br   that is all i have to say about that . . . . .

357 ===> i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart  but i was flabbergasted when i saw the  .  rating to one of my childhood favourites . it doesn  t wow me as much at    but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie . kids will definitely love it and won  t mind the flaws  and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film . none of the film was preachy in any way  in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness . i will admit though that the story is on the thin side  and some scenes like screweyes  s death  which still freaks me out  may be a tad on the scary side . but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation . the music by james horner is very beautiful  and the song featured is memorable  catchy and amusing . i really liked the characters  louie is probably the most in  depth of them all  but the dinosaurs were at least engaging . martin short  s clown was both hilarious and emphatic  the part when he tells screweyes  i quit   had me in stitches . my favourite is screweyes though  an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent . if anything though  i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could  ve been more developed in terms of depth . the script  while not oscar  worthy  has its funny and heart  warming parts  and should keep kids and adults entertained . the voice acting for me was what made the movie . john goodman  martin short  rhea perlman  felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances  but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable . all in all  this is a good movie . i don  t get the rating  honestly i don  t . sure this film isn  t perfect  and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time  but it is good fun .  .     bethany cox

358 ===> i saw this when it first came to video  my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably   at the time . . . what stood out for me was the lack of mid  movie conflict that so many movies have  where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don  t say the one thing that you  re shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal  that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say . this is what i like the most about the movie i guess  that the main characters don  t do mean things to each other halfway through . . . they don  t break up and make up  they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on .  br    br   these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track  they  re not that different . loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family  and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone . anyway  i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again . . . sure there  s plot holes if you analyze the script and no  woog and dweeb shouldn  t be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality .  br    br   now  what detracts from the film is it  s unexpected scariness . little kids under the age of  would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr . screweyes . and  the addition of him halfway through the movie  though it  s blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance  is too abrupt . . . there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie  perhaps to show that it  s not that scary without the the dinosaurs . i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie  so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half .  br    br   considering the target audience  who i  m sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues . . . i think i  ll give it a pass on those factors too  and just enjoy the story . it  s a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind . . . makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every   years i think .

359 ===> this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together . well there  s nothing wrong with that  except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together .   percent of the cast are white males about same age . it  s almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves . the movie has no plot . it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath . there are some funny scenes and comedic bits . but they don  t redeem the flat monotony .  br    br   the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do  and not done very well at that . anything that can  t be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation .  br    br   i went to see this film after seeing the trailer  which makes it look like a tarrentino piece . well  the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get . ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane  inane comedy . it works at times  but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over . it  s more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie . it  s a hit  you  over  the  head  with  it kind of comedy . i can see where the story idea is intriguing . but  in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england . in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era . he plans to make a part  . i guess he thinks he  s tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing .  br    br   at the opening in la  wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part  . he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one  to which he replied  well yea  sure .  

=======================================================================================================

360 ===> this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched . do not rent  the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie . it starts with some what of a plot  then fades fast to nothing . i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover . the actors were awful  the plot faded fast  filming left to much work to be done . not one good thing to say about this crap movie . if you rent this movie you will waste your money . i really enjoy national lampoon movies  but this was a waste of time . learn to write  learn to act  learn to produce  and learn to direct . i feel i should sue these a  holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost .  

=======================================================================================================

361 ===> i wouldn  t call  we  re back  a dinosaur  s story  simply a kiddie version of  jurassic park  . i found it more interesting than that . like the former  it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours . but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman  rhea perlman  jay leno  walter cronkite  julia child  kenneth mars  yeardley smith  martin short and larry king . to paraphrase that a given actor  the  cheers  woman  the  tonight show  host  the most trusted name in news  a famous chef  the  young frankenstein  police chief  lisa simpson  one of the three amigos and the cnn guy .  br    br   but i guess that i shouldn  t focus only on the cast . i thought that this movie had something for both children  purely fun  and adults  natural history  . true  it  s escapism  but the perceptive kind . i would actually say that john goodman doing rex  s voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in  monsters inc  . worth seeing .  

=======================================================================================================

362 ===> this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young  it had everything that was great with    s kids movies . . . lovable dinosaurs  cute kids  an eccentric villain  and a few great songs  and not the typical little mermaid  beauty and the beast type songs  but ones that are atually entertaining   i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever  i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie  and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations  sorry not the most informative  i  m in kinda a rush . . . just please  trust me . all who go against this movie are killing their inner child   

=======================================================================================================

363 ===> i expected alot from this movie . kinda like lee as a naustradamous like caracter but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie . i can  t even explain this movie . it had wooden acting  terrible script from pieces from the bible like hurricanes  tidal waves and earthquakes . but that was at the end  the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn  t . this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest . the convent end up being the key to the misshappenings . the whole movie is missleading and boring . one of lees worst .  

=======================================================================================================

364 ===> end of the world is an uneventful movie  which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth . the main character is some kind of scientist  i  m not exactly sure what kind . he has two jobs at a government    facility guarded by four security men . his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space  although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job    . job   requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room . . . at least that  s the best i can figure . apparently the  plant  is not exactly top  secret  as the scientist brings his wife there . she hangs out  they  re on their way to a dinner  while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption  repeated over and over . he says something about it being the first message from space he  s ever been able to decipher his wife tells him they  re going to be late for the dinner party . so they leave and go to the party      . moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake . from there  the movie goes . . . nowhere  yes  christopher lee is in it  but that really doesn  t help much . besides  lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii . this movie is boring  but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z  grade sci  fi . plus  there  s lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed .  

=======================================================================================================

365 ===> this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of . the japanese people    who star in this must have been really desperate for a job  or we  re just friends . here  s the scoop  br    br   three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman  they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her  they burn her  kick her  spin here around in a chair  over    times    they use sound torture  by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over   hours  it don  t sound that bad at all  but it can make you go nuts  . they throw guts  probably from an animal  at her while shes knocked out  and she freaks when she wakes up . and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen   br    br   if you have not heard of these films  and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film  you will think it is   just ask charlie sheen  this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick  like i said pure underground . check it out if you are a fan of underground horror  or foreign gore . if your not i highly recommend you read  up on the series before watching  from the gore  shock  and creativity aspect it gets a    but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a  . an underground classic . . .  br    br   my final rating is a      br    br    

=======================================================================================================

366 ===> i first heard of this movie after purchasing the     flick  snuff  . i was told that devil  s experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set . i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one  so my interest was peaked .  br    br   devil  s experiment is a short film with no story  no character development . just  men torturing a woman for about   minutes . they torture her in various ways like beating her  spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol  forcing her to listen to hi  pitched noise for   hours  smash her hand with a mallet  burning and putting maggots on the burns  throwing guts at her  and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye .  br    br   i must say that a lot of this movie was fake  like the beating scenes . but then  some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out . the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it . or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for   hours is painful to think about . the worst is the eye scene . i didn  t shutter when watching it but simply thought  damn  that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie  . i did enjoy the flick but i don  t know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer .      

=======================================================================================================

367 ===> end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad . being a big fan of mega star actor christopher lee i was fooled . like tentacles     a good cast does not mean it  ll be a good film . the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium  many parts of the movie are too dark to see whats going on . the rest of the cast is shown briefly likelew ayres  dean jagger  and macdonald carey as a security guard . i would expect better from charles band who made good fun movies like the re  animater and dolls . i heard christopher lee was tricked into making this film . he was told his co stars were going to be jose ferrer  john carridine  and dean jagger . well dean jagger is there but the other two never made it  lucky them  if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline . dean jagger went on to do two good movies afterwardsalligator     and game of death     sue lyon  lolita  is also in the movie minus her lollipop . if you are a glutton for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie .  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

368 ===> what can i say about this film other than  don  t see it  . i waited and waited and waited for someting  or anything  to happen and it just didn  t come . watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie . what are they doing  are they solving a mystery  are they gathering clues  possibly  it  s just hard to tell . at the end of the movie  after a lot of radio signals are decoded  illegibly on some sort of pet monitor  and this guy gives some lectures  the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible . some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth  i guess they don  t like sharing the wealth  . my guess is they finished filming and saw their   minute work or art  garbage   and decided that they  d let the editing crew turn it into an   minute feature film . watch at your own peril  it  s not even funny because it  s so bad  it  s just bad .  

=======================================================================================================

369 ===> i haven  t always been a fan  but the show grew on me . it wasn  t until after season  that i started to see the richness of the show . they finally brought daniel jackson  s search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go  ould system lords were killed by rival lords  sg   or others .  br    br   towards season   stargate sg    was beginning to become stale . with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise  the show became more and more solid .  br    br   the characters had become stale as well . colonel jack o  neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage . after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o  neill  s weapon  he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go  ould ra . the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself . only allowing his close friends in .  br    br   amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter . she was a feminist on the edge  ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job . though this character had little area to grow  tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter  s strengths . she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently .  br    br   christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal  c . teal  c was an alien called the jaffa . infant go  ould   snake like creatures  would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form . the jaffa would die . teal  c was the first prime of apophis  army . knowing that apophis was not a god like go  ould pretend  he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy . finally  having had enough  he and jack o  neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people . after arriving on earth  he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for  who would help him fight the go  ould . christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character . teal  c is a wise warrior  much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra  tac . the show would not be complete without master bra  tac played by tony amandola . he is also a rock . in the end  he became adviser to most of sg    especially daniel jackson .  br    br   don s . davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand . davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal . he does his job  has a wife  sons and daughters and grandchildren . you can really say  he is the anchor of the base . simply  i would die for that man . if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world . he will go himself . he doesn  t leave anyone behind .  br    br   i saved dr . daniel jackson for last  because this character  i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on . in choosing shanks i don  t think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson  they don  t talk about spader  they talk about shanks . in the early years  the jackson character came off as a whiner . that  s why i probably wasn  t a fan . as the seasons pasted  the character became stronger . this gave him confidence . in the end  as of season    the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero . he still monitors the groups ethics . he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward . acheaology  history  culture and exploration are part of his very being . he is determined . though a man of peace  he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement .  br    br   other characters include  most recently vala mal doran  claudia black  and colonel cameron mitchell  ben browder   new lead of sg   . both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess . i see little difference between mitchell and crichton  farscape character  . black  s character is simply off the wall . definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon .

370 ===> guinea pig the devil  s experiment is without a doubt  stars on first view  its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature . this movie gets right to the point  you may be thinking what point  the point is to satisfy fan  s of just extreme violence and gore . this movie has some gore  more or less just torturing a women violently . there are really only  scene  s that could be considered gore . i  ll tell you one thing though guinea pig the devil  s experiment makes hostile look like sesame street . if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain  t seen the half of it until you  ve seen guinea pig the devil  s experiment .  br    br   movie rating     gore      br    br   guinea pig the devil  s experiment  uncut       

=======================================================================================================

371 ===> dull  cheap sci  fi thriller  made with an almost total lack of conviction  a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only one man  and is very poorly guarded at night   and full of campy sound effects . christopher lee is not only wasted  but he also gives one of his few  i  m here strictly for the money  performances .        

=======================================================================================================

372 ===> a good deal of running around . a badly conceived adversary with very little complexity . a scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them  gets caught up with aliens . along with his pretty wife  he invades their territory and is given secrets about them . he becomes rather traitorous in the process . granted  he is given little choice anyway . there is a scene where he gives them everything they want . this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens . the plot isn  t technically bad . it  s just that we are usually following a car  a trip through a woods  investigating a building . this is what editing is all about . i suppose the story wouldn  t technically support much more . not much here .  

=======================================================================================================

373 ===> after having watched  guinea pig   two questions come in mind  besides  am i really a psychopath to watch that      is it a snuff   the answer is no  although it  s the closest thing to a snuff movie i  ve ever seen . and then   where the hell have they found that girl   . because she gets tortured for    min  without any reasons given  in fact  there is nothing else in this movie    fingernails teared off  beaten with hands  feet  tools  infested by maggots  . . . and many more until the final scene  i  m still not sure how they did that  . because it belongs to the  japonese underground scene   it  s obvious she didn  t get a lot of money . so what were her  their  motivations   br    br   i saw it in japonese without subtitles  but it  s not a problem  no real dialogues  the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes  . i haven  t seen yet all the serial  but the first  guinea pig  is not known for being the best one . still i  ve rated   because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff  the issue is quite good  ask charlie sheen  the actor  . but i think they could have gone further  which they did in the following ones .  br    br   another movie i  m hiding from my parents .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

374 ===> this movie has no story . it  s only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death .  br    br      spoilers     br    br   this is what they do they beat her  put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood  spin her around on a chair until she pukes  expose her to loud noise  pour boiling oil on her  put worms in her sores  crush her hand with a sledge  hammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye .  br    br   this movie was so realistic that if i didn  t know it was fake i would have thought it was a snuff  movie . although i was disgusted by this movie i really liked it . it scared me . i guess it fills some kind of purpose . i give it a      .  

=======================================================================================================

375 ===> christopher lee is one of my favorite actors  i  m trying to view all of his work . he has been known to single  handedly save movies with his presence . unfortunately  this is not one of them . this movie suffers from a low budget and it  s production values are disturbing . please . . . for the love of christopher . . . . avoid this film   

=======================================================================================================

376 ===> spoilers  br    br   wow  end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience .  br    br   here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space  a la independence day  . the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china . he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he  s trying to figure out who  s receiving the messages  and who  s also sending out messages in space  . he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent . they visit it . everything looks normal  including the priest played by a bored christopher lee . but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent . so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens  disguised as priests and nuns . they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet . once the alien get the special element  the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform . lee  being the last alien left  tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens . lee walks in the transporter and he  s gone . the couple  looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world  decide to follow the aliens . because earth is doomed  the couple doesn  t see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear . the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding . the end .  br    br   that  s it .  br    br   i  ve never seen such a dull movie in my life . it  s the most underwhelming movie i  ve ever experienced . the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen . they don  t care about anything . they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide  what the heck  who needs earth anyway   they don  t even try to stop them or do something to make things better . this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent . the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces  so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work . i wasn  t expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production  but i didn  t expect it to be this bad .  br    br   christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions . well  i  m sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun . starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining . end of the world is much  much  much worst it  s beyond dull and inert  with no entertainment value whatsoever .  

=======================================================================================================

377 ===> this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best . at the same time  it looks realistic and unrealistic  just knowing that the movie is fake . the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways . a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address  and it includes a manga video  showing the torture . the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die . some scenes are shocking  such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched    times  because you see punches in nearly every movie . this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people   or older .  br    br

378 ===> the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape  complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame . it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black  clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers  her hand smashed with a hammer  her eye punctured with a needle  and so forth .  br    br   in the most nauseating scene  the woman  s captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns . the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen  believing the series to contain actual murder  attempted to ban its distribution in the united states . an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers   sick re  creations using nasty  but obvious special effects . gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic  book artist hideshi hino  who also directed the third and fourth episodes  this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms . but  gorehounds probably won  t find anything special .  

=======================================================================================================

379 ===> your mind will not be satisfied by this nobudget doomsday thriller but  pray  who  s will  a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church people .  br    br   small  apocalyptically themed outing  end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely    s similar movies . and it  s not only that  but eotw plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well . the villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor .  br    br   this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation  that significantly    s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated . anyway  the convent  s secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco  christopher lee is the pride of end of the world but the end of the world is not at all his pride   

=======================================================================================================

380 ===> this film had a great cast going for it christopher lee  dean jagger  macdonald carey  lew ayres   solid b  movie actors all . but this downer of a movie didn  t use any of them to any sort of advantage  with none of their characters even meeting on screen  though christopher lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes  .  br    br   the motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat . first  they just want to repair their ship and leave  then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need . then  out of nowhere  this  peaceful  race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many  diseases   though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society  .  br    br   most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing . you almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end  just in vengeance for boring us to death .  br    br   unless you really like chris lee or seventies low  budget sci  fi  i  d give this one a miss . it falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between star odyssey and ufo target earth .

381 ===> wow  alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here . wonderful . my name is steve and i run unearthed films . we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america . now before you ask why am i writing a review  instead ask why some people bash it . i  m writing this review because i love the guinea pig films . why do i love em  it  s because they go for the throat and they don  t let go . i  ve seen it all . almost every horror film known to man  argento  fulci  bava  buttgereit . from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster . i  ve seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films . why because it doesn  t try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the  st place . this review is for the devils experiment . i find it devoid of story which is fine by me . why do i watch horror films  so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people . the devils experiment not only delivers but that  s all it is . pure unadulterated violence . yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold . why do people bash it . cause they like a story  so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story . it make em feel better about themselves . we all want blood and gore . it  s just really hard to justify it if it  s not wrapped around a story . the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released .  br    br   i  m thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world . maybe i shouldn  t have written this review but then again maybe i should . my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it  s not . i  ve always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films . sure it  s exploitive and over the top but isn  t that why we watch horror films in the  st place . the devils experiment is not for everybody . it  s for thrill seekers and gorehounds only . if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those . but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you . there is a reason why they haven  t been released for over   years . they are wrong  disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom  unless she is totally cool . good luck  enjoy and never stop living your life .  

=======================================================================================================

382 ===> a lot of people unfairly sh  t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining . devil  s experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work   not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic   especially for the video  s vintage and low  budget .  br    br   let me start at the beginning now for those who don  t know this film is an  extreme  torture  fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid    s . it  s plot as it stands is simple a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is . this entails brutal violence   all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl  s arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound .  br    br   the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground . these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings .  br    br   the actress who plays the victim of the  experiment  is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera . her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling . some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest . also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes .  br    br   if you haven  t seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot .  .     for devil  s experiment .  

=======================================================================================================

383 ===> i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial . the commercial was great  but it i found out later that it had every explosion or  special effect  in the entire movie  about   and even some that weren  t in the movie . there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember . it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people . i guess my world of innocence ended that day  when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies .  

=======================================================================================================

384 ===> that is the only question i am left with . why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast  why was the writing so bad  it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters  why did it not make any sense at all  why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and  hollywood  the hell out of it when all it needed was good  smart story telling  why  i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they  re released . i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey  who are oscar winners  that this never is released to the big screens in america .  br    br   as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism  the whole story is just utterly laughable . i just . . . think the script had potential  but the execution turned it into a clich  and an awful one at that . just . no .  

=======================================================================================================

385 ===> the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black  clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . she is beaten savagely  spun around in the chair endlessly  has her finger nails pulled  animal guts are thrown at her  hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle  really sick and nasty scene  . the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape . of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome . i have seen also  flowers of flesh and blood  which is more gory and sadistic  but less disturbing . anyway  this one is a must  see for horror fans   

=======================================================================================================

386 ===> first off  this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to . the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema  apparently its the other way around . if one were to look back after the film it really wasn  t meant to be convincing  it was a low budget ipecac . but really thats all it was aiming for  it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value  and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions  .  br    br   i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific  in non  shock sense  it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid  pessimistic  i didn  t trust anyone for about a week because i didn  t want to wake up strung up and tortured   

=======================================================================================================

387 ===> wow  i just saw this on t . v . as one of the  scary  movies they show around halloween . was this rated g  there wasn  t really anything to make this movie scary  or worth watching . also  other people say this is a spoof  but i don  t think so . for a spoof  you need something called  humor  . this low  budget crap  fest didn  t have a shred of humor  and it didn  t make much sense  either . you basically have a goofy looking monster  man in rubber suit  coming out of closets  killing people  i guess  since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath . the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster  so i guess that  s good enough .  br    br   the military tries feebly to kill the monster  which isn  t much larger than a man . they have very bad aim . then the military flees  wow  did this movie make the u . s . military look pathetic or what  the monster  while hard to kill  doesn  t do much besides shuffle around and roar . oh  and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks . it was a slightly interesting  yet a total alien ripoff .  br    br   what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster  it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality . also  why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long  why didn  t the monster go into the closet when it had a chance  why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless   

=======================================================================================================

388 ===> now  i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching  in the same way that you watch a car crash . . .  br    br   i appreciate the fact it  s a spoof  but that should not stop me from criticising the god  awful directing  acting and dialogue . seriously  this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen  it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper  and a poor one at that . . .  br    br   okay  a few criticisms    when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster  we never see the monster attack him  so we assume its a heart attack   the army then launch shells  rockets  bullets at the monster  which was feet from the doctor  yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive    the army attack from about    yards away  and we see a flame  thrower being used  geez  those things have a range of no more than   metres     when the monster tries to take the professor  the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling the monster drops the kid  and the soldiers don  t try to shoot the monster    come on     the monster looks like it something out of power rangers     there is one scene where the five  good guys   the priest  the girl  the doctor  the reporter and the kid  all look shocked and we get reactions  along the lines of hand to mouth  one after the other  so natural     the general just runs away  time after time    the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn  t listen    the acting is awful    did i mention the rubber suit monster         that god  awful music  non  stop   

=======================================================================================================

389 ===>   house of games  is a flawlessly constructed film  and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends . i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert  s review  which proclaimed it the best film of     . i had my doubts  mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year . boy  was i in for a surprise . this was one of the smartest  most well  written movies i had ever seen .  br    br   the screenplay is quite a piece of work  not only in terms of the plot  which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out   but also in terms of character development . on my second viewing  i began to realize that mamet  s screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film  but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations . the climax of the movie is particularly effective  because it is absolutely inevitable . it stems naturally from what we know about the characters  and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending . the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film . i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike  and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset . their work  plus mamet  s extraordinary screenplay  combine to create one of the greatest films of the      s . it is truly a must  see .  

=======================================================================================================

390 ===> just watched the film for the  rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before . it just keeps getting better and better . you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech  the slow deliberate action  everything being exactly in place .  br    br   truly one of the great ones and definitely my all  time favourite     

=======================================================================================================

391 ===> the head of a common new york family  jane gail  as mary barton   works with her younger sister ethel grandin  as loma barton  at  smyrner  s candy store  . after ms . grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves  ms . gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore  as larry burke  must rescue the virtue  threatened young woman .  br    br    traffic in souls  has a reputation that is difficult to support  it isn  t remarkably well done  and it doesn  t show anything very unique in having a young woman  s  virtue  threatened by sex traders . perhaps  it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length  claimed to have been ten reels  originally  . the new york city location scenes are the main attraction  after all these years . the panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable  because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move .  br    br    traffic in souls           george loane tucker  jane gail  matt moore  ethel grandin  

=======================================================================================================

392 ===> kirstie alley  looking a bit slimmer  but only a bit  is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike  bleached blond hair and all . the premise of the movie is about an older woman        who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer . not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting  inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot . there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirstie  s character and why this is included is a mystery . the actor who portrays kirstie  s brother is so wooden and miscast  it was torture to watch their scenes . what is there to say about this film . avoid it .  

=======================================================================================================

393 ===> house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part . a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game .  br    br   have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong  watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way . sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators . you  re never sure of who is exactly who in this movie .  br    br   this is both a quality and a drawback of the script . as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency . but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development .  br    br   this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling .  

=======================================================================================================

394 ===> plenty has been written about mamet  s  the house of games   most of it good . i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after   years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again . the film  s success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam . mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us  the audience  and the mark simultaneously . then he explains the art of conning only to do it again  etc . all the while building the story .  the house of games   now a freebie on cable  is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans .  b   

=======================================================================================================

395 ===> this piece ain  t really worth a comment . . it  s simply the worst  horror  movie i have ever seen . the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry . shame on you i say    

=======================================================================================================

396 ===> without a doubt this is one of the worst films i  ve ever wasted money on  the plot is  erm sorry  did i say there was a plot  the scariest moment was when . . .  nope can  t think of one  the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was . . .  nope can  t think of one for that either . you knew who the killer was right from the start . there was nothing scary about the whole movie  in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister  misty  in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off . this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie     

=======================================================================================================

397 ===> in the spirit of the classic  the sting   this movie hits where it truly hurts . . . in the heart  a prim  proper female psychiatrist  hungry for adventure  meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals . the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman  and begs to be involved in his operation . while the movie moves kind of  slow   it  s climax and ending are stunning  you  ll especially enjoy how the doctor  forgives herself    

=======================================================================================================

398 ===> i enjoyed this show for two reasons  . richard dean anderson  . amanda tapping . these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors . the replacement of rda in seasons     was enough to take the heart out of the show .  br    br   the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous . you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling . this relationship carries over into the program we get to see .  br    br   rda gives his  o  neill  character believable personality . he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest . you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances . still  they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous .  br    br   there is a lot going on between  carter  and  o  neill  under the surface . they manage to keep the lid on  but often just barely . the episode  solitudes  in season  had some of the best drama ever seen on television . the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together .  br    br    carter  and  jackson  often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by  o  neill  . yet  o  neill  s  tactical instincts always seem sound . he understands what to do without having to think about the matter . the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders .  br    br   the quality declined markedly in seasons  and   . the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest . ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show . he had his rare moments with claudia black  but that was all . amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons . you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby . she was probably thinking more about the child than the show .  br    br   the spin  off  stargate atlantis  has a few moments  but is mostly a weaker effort . the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original . the villains  wraiths  are so improbable as to be ludicrous . maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won  t last beyond the fourth season .  br    br   there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show . to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci  fi . the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad . the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra  modern technology is just as hard to accept .  br    br   i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too . in the season  opener   daniel jackson  is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded . he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet . the episode  hathor  has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc  yet it is never mentioned again . this device could have been used in several later episodes on  daniel    o  neill   and  dr . frasier  .  

=======================================================================================================

399 ===> wow . i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast . justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had .  br    br   his acting was painful to observe . the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors  heck  even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on . how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend .  br    br   his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass  and he is supposed to be the hero . . . i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video . maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at  am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned  this may be ok .  br    br   watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human  kermit the frog  act in a hollywood blockbuster  just didn  t work at all .  

=======================================================================================================

400 ===>   american nightmare  is officially tied  in my opinion  with  it  s pat   for the worst movie of all time .  br    br   seven friends  oddly resembling the k  mart version of the cast of  friends   gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare  a pirate radio show . it  s hosted by a guy with a beard . that  s the most exciting aspect of his show .  br    br   chandler  monica  joey  and . . . oh wait  i mean  wayne  jessie  and the rest of the bad one  liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj . unbeknownst to them  a crazed nurse  serial killer is listening . . .  br    br   crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and . . . wait  sorry again . . . by making their fears come to life . these fears include such stunners as  voodoo  and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures .  br    br   no . really .  br    br   this movie was  in a word  rotten . crazy nurse  s killing spree lacks motivation  there  s nothing to make the viewer  jump   the ending blows  and   again   voodoo   br    br   if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones  rent  american nightmare  with them .  br    br   if you care for your loved ones   even a little bit   go to your local blockbuster  rent all of the copies of  american nightmare  and hide them in your freezer .  

=======================================================================================================

401 ===> this movie should not be compared to  the sting   or other caper  heist  con game films . what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships  deceit and trust . it  s also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry  given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale . has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy  highly  hugely recommended   

=======================================================================================================

402 ===> ask yourself where she got the gun  remember what she was taught about the mark  s mindset when the con is over  the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning .  br    br   when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her   thousand .  br    br   the patient was in on the con from the beginning .  br    br   mantegna does not die in the end  the gun had blanks .  br    br   there  enough spoilers for you there  this is why people are giving it such high ratings . it  s extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience .  

=======================================================================================================

403 ===> when i read the back of the dvd case  i thought that it sounded really interesting . . . so . . . i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the   for   dollars  section at blockbuster . when we got home and popped in the movie . . . twenty minutes into it  we found ourselves turning to each other going  this sucks . let  s put in something else .  i  ll admit  a few of the lines from the friends at the caf made us smile a little bit . but come on  at least get some decent actors  every once in a while in a movie  if the acting is bad and the movie isn  t going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting  i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they  re over  or under  doing their lines . but i can only take so much . crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter  there was no delivery for their lines . . . amateur doesn  t even come close to the acting in this film .  br    br   anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie . it  s the most pointless thing i  ve ever had the displeasure of watching . do not watch or buy this movie       

=======================================================================================================

404 ===> when it comes to horror movies  i am more than willing to suspend disbelief  ignore sub  par production values  and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare . this movies simply has no good scares to offer . it can  t even be enjoyed as camp . bad dialogue  bad acting  bad direction  the kills were predictable and poorly staged  the music was annoying  the camera work was wretched  even the costumes were bad . i felt really bad for the actors  who were obviously trying  but who had to deal with terrible  contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction . i doubt they got any rehearsal  either . it  s embarrassing to watch  and so boring than making it through to the contrived  surprise  ending requires tremendous endurance . it  s quite easily one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen .  br    br   i don  t normally write reviews  but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others . this movie is a complete waste of time . if you must watch this movie  don  t miss the  making of   featurette . the writer  director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold  daring move .  seen it .  he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it  s a new  age  citizen kane .  it  s like listening to a group of third  graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant . they truly think they  ve created something of substance . it  s sad  really the only reason i gave this movie a    is because i think    should be reserved for true atrocities  like  manos hands of fate  and  space mutiny .  so  american nightmare  isn  t the worst movie i  ve ever seen  but i  d have to say that it  s somewhere in the bottom fifty .  

=======================================================================================================

405 ===> spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters . but who is conning who here  when does the hunter turn into the prey  this gritty  dark movie is slow moving and seductive . it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path  only to waylay you just as you think you are safe .  br    br   it has a riveting script  with good acting  at least from the leads  . i didn  t notice the background music  but it was never jarring  so it must have been done right .  br    br   i was very surprised that i liked this movie  because i don  t usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end .

406 ===> get ready for it this is one of my favourite films of all time . i am relatively unaware of david mamet  s  writer and director  other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times  it  s always a joy to watch   i can say without hesitation that he is a genius . this film is extremely well written  and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit  con  artistry and back room hustles . the feel of the film is very similar to the sting       and it also pays homage to film noir .  br    br   it  s quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters . it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch .  br    br   generally  the acting is superb  especially joe mantegna  but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it  s not a good idea to have a heroine  lindsay crouse  who is not only a gambler  a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad    s hairdo . i agree  but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role .  br    br   the less you know about the plot of this film  the better  just like mamet  s most recent film  the spanish prisoner  because the ending will be even more impressive . just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance .  

=======================================================================================================

407 ===> the premise is amazing and the some of the acting  notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp  is charming . . . but this film is near unwatchable . the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap . most of the singing is off  key . i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it . . . the dialogue is really stupid and trite . the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub  plots . i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after   wondering  when is it ever going to end .   

=======================================================================================================

408 ===> so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film  and you might be thinking to yourself   huh . there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december   .  funny thing is  most of these rave reviews sound like they  re coming from the same person  or at best a small  coordinated group of  open house  groupies . the truth  my friends  is that this film is truly unwatchable . just because it  s  independent  doesn  t mean it gets a free pass . if you  re going to make a musical  whether on film or on stage  whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse  you should probably make sure that  a .  your actors can sing   b .  your actors can dance   c .  you have decent sound equipment   d .  you have a well  written score  and  e .  you have lyrics that are witty and charming . even anthony rapp can  t save this one . it  s one of those unfortunate movie  going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved .  

=======================================================================================================

409 ===> this is very nearly a perfect film . the ideas would be repeated by mamet  but never told so succinctly . this is really about the failure of trust  of the human condition . the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals  no one is innocent . is there anyone alive today who hasn  t seen this play out in our own society  every single day  the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller . except  there are no more innocent characters . the world is now completely polluted  ruined and everyone is participating in the con . could anything be more true   br    br   don  t miss the soundtrack . it is wonderful .  

=======================================================================================================

410 ===>   house of games  is definitely not without its flaws  plot holes  stiff acting  final scenes  but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head .  house of games  does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do . of course  this is not a huge feat given the fact that we  re dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate . so it stands to reason that we never really know what  s going on  even though we think that we do . but that  s what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities .  br    br   it has a definite hitchcock slant to it . the film draws on some similar themes found his     effort  marnie   considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master  s more thought  provoking works . one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse  s character being the same as tippi hedrin  s . . . ten year later perhaps . both are strong  willed loners  both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool . as crouse  s repressed  up  tight character says   what  s life without adventure   put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks   

=======================================================================================================

411 ===> the single worst film i  ve ever seen in a theater . i saw this film at the austin film festival in      and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival . it was an interesting premise  and seemed like it could go somewhere  but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything . first of all  if you  re going to do a musical  find someone with musical talent . the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming . the lyrics were terribly written  and when they weren  t obvious rhymes  they were groan  inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work . and you  d think you  d find people who could sing when making a musical  right  not in this case . luckily they were half talking  half singing in rhyme most of the time  but when they did sing it made me cringe . especially when they attempted to sing in harmony . and that just addresses the music . some of the acting was pretty good  but a lot of the dialog was terrible  as well as most of the scenes . they obviously didn  t have enough coverage on the scenes  or they just had a bad editor  because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film . at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical . i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again .  

=======================================================================================================

412 ===> this movie was so terrible it was almost good . . . almost . we love musicals  but not this one . even with the terrible sound quality  poor cinematography  and many actors who can  t sing or dance  anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance  especially toward the end  . the character marjorie  a drunk lady  was enjoyable to watch  too .  br    br   the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music . admittadly  some of the songs  fantabulous  are pretty catchy  but not in a good way  .  br    br   open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful  we think it might be a good stage musical  with excellent actors  .  

=======================================================================================================

413 ===> i  m not great at writing reviews  so i  ll just spout my opinions . . .  br    br   i loved this series at first . the adventure  the action  the comedy  the drama . . . i thought it was all brilliant . anderson  tapping  shanks  judge  davis . . . i loved them all . davis  it seemed  was the fifth  most important person in the cast . not a big deal . but when his character  general hammond  left at the end of the seventh season  and anderson  s character  colonel o  neill  moved from the field to the office  the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff . i don  t know whether it  s because hammond was more important that i realized or what  but for some reason  after the seventh season  the series turned to  .  br    br   the first seven seasons  though  were awesome . the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it  but it turned out to be  even if this wasn  t the original intention  a brilliant setup to the series . i recommend that you watch the movie first  then watch the first season of the tv series  then watch the movie again  you  ll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around  believe me   and then watch the rest of the tv series .  br    br   the last three seasons of the series aren  t nearly as good as the first seven  but that doesn  t mean they aren  t good . it just means they  re a letdown if you  ve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons .  br    br   after you have finished this series  be sure to watch the spin off series  stargate atlantis . it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series .  br    br   edit on         i just found out that don s . davis died a few weeks ago . it is a great loss .  

=======================================================================================================

414 ===> house of games is spell binding . it  s so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens . there are few movies i  ve seen that can grip you so quickly . from the opening scene this movie just gets you .  br    br   i  m trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don  t read anymore if you don  t want to know .  br    br   i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen  bar none . from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed .  br    br   lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection  from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately . joe mantegna was also wonderful . the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices . i also loved the way the movie was filmed  in that grainy  surreal type of way  it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was .  br    br   there were a few movies i  ve seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really  house of games is completely different in it  s way . margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i  ve seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet  but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying . you know something  s going to happen but you have no idea what . and just when you think you  ve guessed what the  something  is  you realize you haven  t even scratched the surface . . . .  br    br   house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature . the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well . as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters  we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it . it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it  s conclusion .  br    br   in closing  i  d rank this   of    call it  although not my absolute favorite film  pretty high on the list   most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best  twists  i  ve ever seen as well . although i love all types and genres of movies  when it comes to movies of the human psyche  it really doesn  t get much better then this . see this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

415 ===> did heidijean really see this movie  a great christmas movie  not even close . dull  bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart . i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie  the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance . baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing . probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with . maybe i  m expecting too much for a lifetime movie played   days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie .  

=======================================================================================================

416 ===> carly pope plays jj  a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant  overbearing mother moves in with her . jj  aghast at this turn of events  then blackmails restaurant owner  alex  to entertain her mother in exchange for  maybe  reviewing his dying restaurant . alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother . there are numerous problems with this movie  the characters are universally   dimensional . jj is a self  serving  hateful character  her mother superficial and shallow . jj  s colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic . the underlying message of an over    woman unable to make it on her own  without male assistance is bad  bad  bad . the acting is uniformly dull  the script uninspired . the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city . i would so not recommend this film .  

=======================================================================================================

417 ===> if your idea of a thriller is car chases  explosions  and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire  then  house of games  is definitely not the movie for you . if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense  then  by all means  see it .  br    br    house of games  tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer  dr . margaret ford  lindsay crouse   who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike  joe mantegna  . to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense . frankly  i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming . just like a clever con artist  this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance .  br    br   the story is taut and well  crafted  the dialogue smart and laconic  the acting uniformly good  mantegna is superbly charismatic  . some have complained that dr . ford is not a very sympathetic character  and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive . but dr . ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover  her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot  at one point  i believe that an injury to her sexual self  esteem is a key part of her motivation . . . i  ll say no more  .  br    br    house of games  is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity . it will hold your attention every second while you are watching  and stay with you for a long time afterwards .  

=======================================================================================================

418 ===> house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels . it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller . it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna  and a strong  strong cast of supporting players  and it introduces ricky jay  card sharp extraordinaire  prestidigitator and historian of magic . its dialogue  written by david mamet  is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie  in which reality is often in question  an extra dimension of unrealness .  br    br   on the face of it  house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men  diametrically different from the sting  which was played merely for glamour and yuks . at this level it does succeed admirably .  br    br   however  you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization . the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin . that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus  hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs . house of games sticks to its business . as poe once said of a good short story  it drives relentlessly to its conclusion .  br    br   there is another strain of movies  about  women  epitomized by thelma and louise  a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed  whether or not they realize their inner strengths . what tripe .  br    br   as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater . it should be a natural for film festivals . nominate it for one near you if you get the chance .  br    br   i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my   year old daughter . better she should see it on a tv than not at all .  

=======================================================================================================

419 ===> i hate to sound like an  old person   but frankly i haven  t seen too many movies that i like that were made after     . . . generally  movies just seem to get worse and worse  although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle  the bread  my sweet   except for the  de rigeur  sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie  . this movie makes the mother  a former las vegas chorus girl  seem to be incapable of surviving on her own  although she is clearly in her   s  though hinted at being in her   s  . i didn  t buy it . i  m   and like all the women i know in their   s and   s  more than capable of surviving on my own  as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at    got legally emancipated and set off on my own life  s journey .   br    br   the daughter is not believable in her job role . . . she gets a promotion she doesn  t deserve  a great opportunity  and drops that ball too  but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver  the writers shoot her down as an  opportunist   when she was just doing what any career  oriented person would do   taking advantage of a wide  open opportunity created by the lack of self  discipline of her coworker  a girl who apparently doesn  t understand the concept of honoring her promises  to her boss  in this case  .  br    br   the daughter grudgingly  allows  her mother to stay with her  on a temporary basis  but then treats her mother  the woman who gave her life and raised her to  adulthood   like a pariah . apparently the  writers  of tripe like this do not understand that it is not  the common thing  for parents to act like children  and then be treated as children by their children . that is just more of the societal  baloney  that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we  their public  were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings .  br    br   this is a sad movie with a stupid ending . if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two  dimensional  tv character   he  d have stayed with the mother  who was not that much older than him and quite attractive . but in the end he  falls  for the daughter  a shallow  rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth  but in an ordinary  bland way .  the  opportunist  young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive  physically .   br    br   there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter  who was an uptight  selfish  self  centered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect  to the mother   a woman who was kindhearted  sweet  tempered  humorous  and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend . of course the mother had her own flaws . . . she had reacted to her husband  s demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter .  br    br   regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed  this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney .  where  s the mustard    

=======================================================================================================

420 ===> having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style  technique to match the larger scale of this movie . i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard  hitting fact  based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities  but this is not it . this plays like a bottom  to  mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the   s  e . g . ss experiment camp etc  perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually  . granted it has a greater scope and more people running around  but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non  actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots  spiced up with the occasional poorly executed  shock  sequence . the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power . watch channel   s  the holocaust   aired recently  still running    as of  no      for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war  featuring excellent in  context use of actual footage  . this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves  not this hackneyed exploitation garbage  a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine  but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie  . rating    as exploitation   as a treatment of the subject  .  

=======================================================================================================

421 ===> david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with house of games   a character study fraught with psychological overtones  in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game . margaret ford  lindsay crouse  has a successful practice and has written a best  selling novel   driven .  still  she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life there  s an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve  and it primes her vulnerability . when a patient  billy hahn  steven goldstein   confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers  and that they  re going to kill him if he doesn  t pay  she decides to intervene on his behalf . this takes her to the house of games   a seedy little dive where she meets mike  joe mantegna   a charismatic con  man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world . instead of the twenty  five large  that billy claimed he owed  mike shows her his book  and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars . and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean  if she  ll agree to do him one simple favor  which involves a card game he has going on in the back room . in the middle of a big hand  mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone  her job is to watch for the tell  of one of the other players . by this time  not only margaret  but the audience  as well  is hooked . the dialogue  and mamet  s unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines  is mesmerizing . as mike leads margaret through his compelling  surreal realm of existence  and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game  we are swept right along with her . from that first memorable encounter  when he demonstrates what a tell  is and how it works  to the lessons of the short con   to the stunning climax of this film  mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless . and nothing is what it seems . in the end  margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature  and about herself . she changes and whether or not it  s for the better is open to speculation . mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows  and does . crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid  up  tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm  self  assured exterior  and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her  she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated . she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does  and makes you understand it  as well . the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum  joey   lilia skala  dr . littauer   j . t . walsh  the businessman   ricky jay  george  and william h . macy  sergeant moran  . house of games  is the quintessential mamet he  s written and directed a number of high  caliber plays and films since  and will no doubt grace us with more in the future . but this film will be the one that defines him and you can go to the dictionary and look it up . you  ll find it under perfection .  this is one great movie you do not want to miss . i rate this one      .  

=======================================================================================================

422 ===> this movie is amazing  while being funny and entertaining  it is also profoundly deep and eye  opening . i will watch it again and again . bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life . he has a job and a life  but it isn  t what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness . bruce is bitter  unsatisfied  and resentful that his life isn  t the way he envisions it should be . as a result of this state of mind  bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life . god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers . bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted . his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy . . . . . with one exception . in the process of gaining everything  he loses the one person who truly loved him . as the movie unfolds  bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances  but his perception of what was truly there . this movie was inspirational and deep . if you really pay attention  it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize . as my wife says   since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy   and my humble addition   may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out .   

=======================================================================================================

423 ===> roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on . all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family .  br    br   this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better . as much as i didn  t like  barracuda   that  s on the same dvd  i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane .  br    br   eye candy one pair of tits  they might belong to kirsten baker   br    br   my grade f  br    br   dark sky dvd extras vintage ads for various drive  in food and trailers for  bonnie  s kids   features nudity    the centerfold girls    part  time wife   features nudity    psychic killer     eaten alive  . the dvd also comes with      s  barracuda   

=======================================================================================================

424 ===> this is available on a  drive in double feature  from dark sky films  and since i just had finished up  barracuda   i watched this too . this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time .  br    br   we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town  but where exactly are they  they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor  and try on chinese  style clothes at a shop  but then we see some aztec dancers  and all the while  these girls are being followed by two guys  who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn  t have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town  and they finally catch them .  br    br   it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck  and these guys want to find the loot  and where did she get it  so  in flashback  we go back to find out . and how did they know she had this coin  hard to say  really .  br    br   now  back in the day  when these two women were   years old  they were out with their sisters and their sister  s boyfriends on a boat  and after stopped to get air in their tanks  they tow this young boy back to his home dock  only to have his grandpa come out  invite the  young  uns  up for herbal tea with granny . but not everyone has the tea  todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls  and then when they  re away from it  the boat blows up  and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared . well  it seems as though these  kindly folk  raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell  and serve it herbal tea .  br    br   but the girls and todd did leave the island  but now  they  re returning  escorted by their captors  and they  re there to find the treasure  despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before . there also seems to be someone else on the island  and the thugs mysteriously begin to die  one by one  and since there  s only three  it doesn  t take long . and there  s even a sort of happy ending  which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film .  br    br   the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues  and combined with no acting ability they  re borderline hilarious . the hillbilly  type family is also devoid of acting ability  despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden  who appeared in many films and tv shows . the action is confusing  the locales are even more confusing  and the island looks like southern california .  br    br   so what the hell is this  i  m not sure  but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think  or say   huh   out of    very bizarre .  

=======================================================================================================

425 ===> i absolutely loved this movie . it met all expectations and went beyond that . i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn  t just randomly silly . it also had a message . jim carrey makes me happy .    

=======================================================================================================

426 ===> wow  finally jim carrey has returned from the died . this movie had me laughing and crying . it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from . jeniffer aniston was great  she will finally have a hit movie under her belt . if you liked liar liar you will love this movie . i give it     .  

=======================================================================================================

427 ===> this really should deserve a  o  rating  or even a negative ten . i watched this show for ages  and the show jumped the shark around series  . this episode  however  is proof that the show has jumped the shark . it  s writing is lazy  absurd  self  indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and butthead .  br    br   it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun   pirates of the caribbean  the mummy  count of monte cristo   all  fun  movies that are not to be taken seriously . however  there is such thing as ridiculous as in  this is the worst thing i  ve ever seen .  and indeed  this is the worst episode of stargate i  ve ever seen . it  s absolutely dreadful  and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement .  br    br   makes me want to sell all of my stargate props  most seriously .

428 ===> i don  t remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake  s in  edison .  i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish  destroy the screen  readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism . timberlake is horribly miscast in fact  casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in  patton   or nathan lane to play jesus . but that is almost beside the point .  br    br   timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role . i used to have problems with ben affleck  s acting talent  but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench . with his metrosexual lisp  read lithp   his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like  the   clich expressions for actors   he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly  and no matter how you slice it  i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur  turned  crusader  for  justice journalist . it simply will not fly .  br    br   however  timberlake alone isn  t to blame for his failure . director david j . burke puts him not only in the  essentially  primary role  but also places him aside morgan freeman  kevin spacey  john heard  dylan mcdermott  cary elwes and  i  m surprised he was as good  ll cool j . i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake .  br    br   there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief . a pleasure  if you will . freeman and spacey may not have more than   minutes of screen time alone together  but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so  called hero . dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air .  br    br   but enough of timberlake bashing  words aren  t enough in this particular case to do the trick .  edison  is a very  very run  of  the  mill corruption story . it  s plot ranges from clich to simply preposterous . i do  however  admire the motivation behind making it  which i interpret as an homage to films like  serpico   or  donnie brasco   or maybe even  chinatown .  don  t get me wrong   edison  is not even in the same ballpark as these films  but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence  perhaps to justify my sitting through it .  br    br   the script  in and of itself  features some surprisingly bad writing . yes  it has some decent interchanges  but any conversation between piper perabo  who is wasted here  and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson  s creek episode . it  s your typical far  too  glib  for  reality  let  s  impress  the  audience  with  how  well  we  articulate  and fail  dialogue . this dialogue  mind you  is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments  sometimes it feels like  edison  wants to morph into a music video  where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting  but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds  read slow  motion  .  br    br   thinking about it   edison  is a curiosity . it  s sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn  t work . in film as in most art  if one thing is off  the whole thing feels off . directors must make tough choices . david j . burke missed the mark here . some of the scenes play well in and of themselves  but as a whole  they don  t seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture . and it  s not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with .

429 ===> bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show  and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent  hey hollywood  look how good i can act   box office disappointments . it  s great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths . he won  t get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the  awarded films  of the academy . he is at the top of his form in this most recent film  it  s like the return of an old friend .  br    br   carrey  freeman  and aniston all do a great job together  comfortable in their comedy roles  superb comic timing  and obviously having fun together but without the  hey mom  look how funny i am  type of comedy . a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey  s nemesis  carrell of the daily show fame   who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film . i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years .  br    br   i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up  in  arms over the treatment of god  but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs  we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will . without married with children t o complain about  this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities  who know the types  men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television  selling prayers to god  . and  again  about  .   of the country will care and    of the media will report it .  br    br   the bottom line this a purely entertaining film  each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do  and a feel  good feeling at the movie conclusion . a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor . what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry .  br    br   thanks again  jim   it  s great to have you back    

=======================================================================================================

430 ===> after a slow beginning  bruce almighty is a very funny film that had something positive to say . it wasn  t one of jim carrey  s best performances  but he was still ok . morgan freeman was just right as god . jennifer aniston had some good moments . i miss steve correll on  the daily show    br    br   i like director tom shadyac  s choices of movies . he also did liar liar  patch adams  and the nutty professor . in all three of those and in bruce almighty  he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him . a director who knows comedy  can get the talent he gets  and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find .  br    br   my biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references . i only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie . my guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references  but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people . that  s too bad because i thought it was a missed opportunity .  br    br   my grade  br    br    out of    

=======================================================================================================

431 ===>    minutes  and it felt twice that long  brief crossing is not brief enough . indeed  the first   minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue  more of a monologue  really  of a woman approaching middle age  tediously droning about  men   disappointment  sex  aging  and her recent breakup  to a french teenager she met in the ship  s cafeteria .  br    br   the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty  free shop  and to a bar  where finally her self  involved rant pushes him away . the  story  can  t end there  of course  so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin .  br    br   what little romance  sex  or for that matter  anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all . yes  the ending is very nicely done  but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner .  br    br   of course  some people like it . i could be wrong .  

=======================================================================================================

432 ===> it has its merit  s morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments . she  s so enigmatic  so original . is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that  s making her so distant and un  relatable  or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary  personally i  d call her dysfunctional .  br    br   morvern is completely detaching herself . disposing of her boyfriend  not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral  she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain . she  s seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed . the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her . although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity . she may as well have killed herself .  br    br   despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the director  s shots were superb  the lighting and color made the film visually stunning .  br    br   it  s really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest . it  s little over   minutes but feels a lot longer . they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don  t care about the characters or the film .  

=======================================================================================================

433 ===> bruce almighty  will sweep the academy awards with a record   oscar wins  it will surpass titanic  as the highest grossing film of all time  jim carrey  s illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the     white house playoffs . almighty then  these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers  carrey included  would possess the powers of god . that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey  s new laugh riot bruce almighty  . carrey plays bruce nolan  a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps . god  heavenly played by morgan freeman  grants bruce the gift of god   his powers  in order to challenge him if he can do god  s job any better . obviously  bruce gets carreyed  away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly . carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in bruce almighty  . jennifer aniston was not mis . pittiful  as bruce  s girlfriend . however  my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for    and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time  bruce almighty  is not the most in  depth carrey film  but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of carreyism    good  

=======================================================================================================

434 ===> jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this     season  late may  and a good improvement on carrey  s past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies . with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self  carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic  tearfully somber moments . elements of jim  s real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie . this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons  including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script . while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy  drama  bruce  almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good  natured taste . eight out of ten stars .  

=======================================================================================================

435 ===> nothing happens .  br    br   then characters with no personality don  t develop .  br    br   then the end never comes because there  s no beginning and no middle .  br    br   there are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren  t even allowed to be  because this movie isn  t even there . there  s no  is  in this movie because there  s no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point . there  s nothing   br    br   there is a good point it has a good soundtrack . but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn  t even worth your time  so if you  re really interested  i  d suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something . you  ll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue  headache  and impatience .  br    br     polarisdib  

=======================================================================================================

436 ===> there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning  and that ignorant fools like me don  t  get  it . obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross .  br    br   it has every  a  hem  artistic clich in the book  i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few . almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense .  br    br   the director of the  almost equally embarrassing  movie  ratcatcher  returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation . the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers .  

=======================================================================================================

437 ===> fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc . carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time  and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting . the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast  including morgan freeman as  god   is great and makes the film worth catching . grade b  

=======================================================================================================

438 ===> well not actually . this movie is very entertaining though . went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the  i think there might be something in my eye  routine . the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance . jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides . in fact all the characters are great . the movie is not overly funny or sappy  good flick to go see with the wife .  br    br   all in all     . . . . note  i am not an easy grader . thats all from bigv over and out   

=======================================================================================================

439 ===> when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible  the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with  or the point is one not easily conveyed to film  or the movie missed the point  which is the most frequent of these results  and the easiest to happen  especially when the point is one not easily defined . the book  morvern callar  has a point every reader of the book must have felt this  and felt as if he had gotten it but i suspect most of them could not state it in words . i  m not sure i can  myself  but perhaps it comes to this  or something like it things come  things go  such is life  but we carry on or at any rate some of us   people like morvern   do . no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition . but the important fact is that there is a point   possibly the sum of the entire story is the point   and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view  and to carry over  in adapting the story to film . the maker of this film evidently missed the point  and doesn  t substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothing .  br    br   this is not the usual complaint of a book  lover that his favorite text has been violated . the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance  and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly . the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half  educated morvern  but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect  as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone  as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance  despite morvern  s own self  characterization as a raver  am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working  class scots girl  and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past  in any case  despite my irritation at the author  i couldn  t deny that his book stuck with me and what i couldn  t get out of my head was his character  s attitude  her angle on the world  which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait . morvern is the kind of person who  s always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her  like flies  so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging  through  unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical   and that doesn  t begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough . the complex of incidents and of morvern  s responses to them are the substance of the book  and its achievement  in exposing a cross  section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book  i can see this .  br    br   the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie or if it is  most of her is kept offscreen . an actress who might have been a good fit for the character  had she been the right age at the right time  is angharad rees  from the old tv series  poldark  . samantha morton  then  would seem like good casting she  s rather the same sort of actress  and in one of her earlier movies   jesus  son   she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one . unfortunately  as the film turned out  she doesn  t have the character from the book to play . for one thing  the book is one that  if it is to be dramatized  virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments  her perspective  her voice  the story loses most of its meaning . it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty  and so morvern  s responses  whether of amusement or distaste  depending on her mood  are missing too  and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story . in short  the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk  edgy serio  comic novel into a genteel art tv film  and chose as her typical image one of ms . morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross . this isn  t at all what the book  or the morvern of the book  was about . for another thing  the morvern of the movie isn  t scottish  the actress said in an interview she hadn  t had time to study up the accent   and she ought to be it  s important that she  her family  and her mates are all from a single place . and finally the film is missing the end of the story morvern  s spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it  s winter  the dam has frozen  the power has gone out  and the pub is dark . minus this  and minus all of the rest  what  s left is a failed art film  a dead film  about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal  or native inability  ever to give in to being dead .  

=======================================================================================================

440 ===> lynne ramsey makes arresting images  and samantha morton can summon feeling with a gesture . so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered  pretentious lark .  br    br   ramsey can  t bring callar to life . her attempts are too arty and oblique . repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if morton  s obliterated gaze alone could supply character . we are in a blank warholian hell of self  indulgence for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor  you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist . but how will it do so if she rarely speaks  without the novel  s interior monologue  the celluloid morvern callar is nobody . small wonder ramsey has morton undress often .  br    br   that said  the first ten minutes were so impressively acted  shot and edited that my hopes were soaring . give the film that much it knows how to make promises  if not how to keep any .  

=======================================================================================================

441 ===> i am a very big jim carrey fan . i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura . i also like him in his serious movies  especially truman show . this one is a cross between his very funny side  and his serious side . he is of course very funny in this movie  but there are parts that are very serious  and he pulls it off with a lot of ease . he is truely a multi  function actor .  br    br   as for the rest of the cast  i was happy with jennifer aniston  s acting . i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass . morgan freeman makes a very cool god . as for steven carell  his limited scenes are very funny  especially in the anchor scene .  br    br   overall  i would have to rate this a  . good acting  funny script  and some very serious situations make this a very good film .  

=======================================================================================================

442 ===> i would have rated the series a perfect   for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season     br    br   the final episode of the   th season  unending   where  it would certainly appear that  the asgard have been killed  off in a very rushed  unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion  left me in disbelief   br    br   from the extremely rushed end of the series  it  s obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season . my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg   franchise for the two upcoming direct  to  dvd moves   br    br   unless the asgard return in a future sg   movie  with a very good explanation of the  apparent  extinction   i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean  up of loose  ends   br    br   poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci  fi series .  

=======================================================================================================

443 ===> my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show . i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is . but he goes on watching it none the less . that is his right as an american i guess . but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode . it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can  t stand . i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college . my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed  but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors . and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along  get the pun  ha  ha . like spielberg did . it  s like jesus before he became a man . or thats at least what i think that would feel like . any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this  even though it contains little of peter falk . i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet . this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo  s investigation  as many later episodes would do .  

=======================================================================================================

444 ===> my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke . little did we realize the joke was on her for paying   for it . while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles . these included  br    br     drinking bleach   rubbing sand in my eyes   writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy   re  enacting the american civil war   tax returns   gcse maths   sex with an old lady .  br    br   garrett clancy  aka sgt . ben draper wrote this  the guy couldn  t even dig a hole properly . the best ting he did was kick a door down  the best part of the film  . this was the worst film i have ever seen  and i  ve seen white noise the light . never has a film had so many mistakes in it . my girlfriend left it here  so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap .  br    br   news just in owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself . fact .  br    br   do not watch  

=======================================================================================================

445 ===> a very funny movie . it was good to see jim carrey back in top form . it was definitely worth the price of admission . morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film . i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however  still a good film to see .  

=======================================================================================================

446 ===> bruce almighty  one of carrey  s best pictures since . . . well . . . a long time . it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too . . . morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny . it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes . the best scene in  it is where jim is messing up the anchor man  s voice .  br    br   my rating      

=======================================================================================================

447 ===> it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person  not even as an extra . that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general .  however .  br    br   no spoilers  only a brief introductory description  br    br   buddy portrays four young people living in a flat  share in oslo . the protagonist are two young men that don  t manage to direct their life in any serious fashion  and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility  a sort of fear of growing up . the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models . quite the clich . although the story is mildly funny  the acting is good and as a  young person  one can sort of identify with the characters crazy  situations and complicated love affairs  i don  t find the story or the characters very believable . to polished and lacking in depth . this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as friends   yes that show on tv  .  br    br   has norwegian film finally found its identity   audience pleasers in well known american style .  br    br   how about watching lukas moodysson  s tillsammans  together  .

448 ===> since  rugrats   falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years  obviously the tyrants at klasky  csupo should be out of ideas . after dumbing down all of the characters  adding even stupider new ones  replacing some voices  though i like nancy cartwright  she is not chucky finster    and having no sense of continuity  ex .  in a kimi episode i watched the other day  tommy and chucky each got a new puppy but it subsequent episode  the aforementioned dogs never appear   you  d think the creators could kill the show for mercy . but noooo .  br    br   all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks  while not as horrible as the kimi episodes  everyone is even stupider than they were  including grandpa  my god  he used to be the best character on the show  but now  he has no real purpose  . the ending is needlessly fluffy  and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes          is that the kids can interact with adults . whoa  what fun   br    br   no stars at all for  the rugrats all growed up  . klasky  csupo  please destroy this show before it gets any worse .  

=======================================================================================================

449 ===> bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan  an average man who feels god is messing up his life . god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways . of course  giving someone god  s powers could take a turn for the worse . bruce almighty is a good comedy  jim carrey is good  as always morgan freeman is first  rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well . the jokes are almost always on target  although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey  s facial expressions . i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god  not only that but also as a black man . i thought this quite well  especially with the brilliant freeman . there are some hilarious scenes  the opening cookie scene for instance  others miss the target slightly but still a good film .    out of    

=======================================================================================================

450 ===>   bruce almighty  looks and sounds incredibly stupid  especially from the trailers . nevertheless  i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more . bruce  jim carrey  is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job . morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god  and though it isn  t his usual type of film or one of his best roles  he does excellent with what he is given to work with . although crude at times  the film does have quite a few laughs  from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers  reactions to him  as well as freeman  s seemingly laid  back and wisecracking image of god . it is overly exaggerated at times  and there is some crude humor  but overall it manages to be somewhat funny . there is a decent supporting cast  such as jennifer aniston  lisa ann walter  and steve carrell  which always helps . the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear  jerking  and the message is clear  that we should do what god has called us to do and  be the miracle .  the film is far from perfect  but still enjoyable  and far better than i and many people probably would have expected  especially if we see the deeper message of the film .  br    br    out of

451 ===> here  let me wave my hands over the keyboard  i  ll tell you what salad she  s going to order . over and over  works like a charm he  s such a genius  omg how does he do it  my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i  m scanning channels  i have to be very careful  these days it  s useful far too often  so i don  t need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this . . . careful with that remote   . is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery  or what  why does it exist    br    br   this is the most inane show  completely unbelievable and contrived  and i cannot understand why it  s still on the air . so may geeks give so much better shows such a hard time  sarah connor chronicles  true blood   but give this nonsensical drivel a pass . shows like firefly  if there were any like that  fall away after a season  but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on . yeccch .

452 ===> as an engineer  i must say this show  s first season started out very promising . most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible  and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge .  br    br   but after the first season  the show started degrading  heavily . most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science  technology for real .  br    br   the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode  but in the end  this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show .  br    br   if you are gonna watch it  go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second . thereafter i would not waste my time . myself  i gave the show up midway through season  .  br    br   season    stars season    stars season    stars  br    br   let  s sum that up to  stars . since charlie doesn  t know his math anymore  i won  t bother with the correctness of mine either .  

=======================================================================================================

453 ===> as someone who lives near buffalo  new york  this movie scored points with me before i even saw it  since the story is based here . there are even some bit parts with real  life news  tv anchor people from buffalo . . and  for once  it doesn  t knock the area . hallelujah   br    br   theology  wise  puh  leeze    god is still made to look and think like humans . . . and  of course  be a bit on the liberal side . being the lightweight comedy it is  it  s nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill    minutes .  br    br   there are some laugh  out  loud slapstick comedy scenes and  hopefully  audiences  from christians to atheists .  got something out of this besides a few laughs  such as what prayer should really be all about . kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message .  br    br   overall  it  s a good  hearted film that should offend very few .  

=======================================================================================================

454 ===> i really do not know what people have against this film  but it  s definitely one of my favourites . it  s not preachy  it  s not anchored by it  s moral  it shouldn  t be controversial . it  s just god . any possible god  no matter the religion . and it  s really funny .  br    br   jim carry plays bruce nolan  a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news  desperate to prove himself  more or less to himself  that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job . this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace  jennifer aniston  away . when the final straws are executed  he  s quick to not laugh  but yell in the face of god  who in turn gives bruce his powers . bruce then makes his life better for himself  until he  s guilted into helping others  where he then continues to miss the point of his powers . meanwhile  his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish  leaving his relationship on dangerous ground .  br    br   ok  that was kinda long . but as a plot  it works well . the step  by  step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together  and is able to hide itself fairly well .  br    br   as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place  carrey  s pitch  perfect acting stays in character  which  luckily enough  is him   and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene . whether they would admit it or not  the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey . without him  the humour would turn flat  as humour is half execution . and the humour is very good in the first place . but without carrey  it would kinda feel like a it  s a wonderful life wannabe .  br    br   jennifer aniston is great and  no matter what some may say  does not act like the only excuse for the third act . at least  you don  t think that when you see her . she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you  re watching a movie  she and carrey feel very much like a real couple .  br    br   the movie feels ggooooodd  see the movie to understand   has a very nice feeling  tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey  s career  which wasn  t goin  anywhere .  .  

=======================================================================================================

455 ===> the  math  aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows . the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow  although his career must have been  undeservedly  waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock .  br    br   the lame  ness of the  math  aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co  starring lou diamond phillips  which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned .  in order to catch a fugitive  the  mathematician  uses some theory about  bubbles  . so  he gives this long explanation that  if we have seen the suspect in places a  b and c  then we can use  bubble theory  to calculate where he might be . he does this all on a chalkboard  or maybe with a stick in the dirt  i cant remember  .  br    br   anyway  when you look at the finished product  he basically took three spots  and picked a point right in the middle and said  ok  mathematically  here  s where we are most likely to find the fugitive .  at which point  one other character points out  oh  that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live .  is that math  its not even connect  the  fkg  dots    this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to  support  points that every one else had already agreed on through either less  complex analysis or basic common sense .  br    br   it just goes to show   when you  re a hammer  everything looks like a nail . i can  t wait til they stick the numb  rs team on osama . . . they  ll use calculus  call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains  and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields . . . cuz hey . . . its all about the numbers .  br    br   totally ludicrous tv show .  

=======================================================================================================

456 ===> this is really really bad . lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job . but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric  i got the evidence on you   .  makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics  attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn  t find it on itunes  . talk about seeing into the future . . . too funny for words . the rest of the movie is forgettable . the score and songs are more interesting than the script . ditto the sequel . which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all . my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies . doesn  t say much for the world  s viewing habits .  

=======================================================================================================

457 ===> now either you like mr carrey  s humour or you don  t . me  myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and  on the other hand  cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth . bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream  but you have been warned .  br    br   if you  re not sure  watch the trailer . i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film . if you don  t find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny  don  t bother with the movie .  br    br   carrey  a reporter stuck in a rut covering  lighter news  berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot . god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better . carrey gets into the swing of having all of god  s powers by making his girlfriend  jennifer aniston   s breasts bigger  getting himself promoted  and answering everyone  s prayers by single stroke computer commands .  br    br   this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable  but it is very well made within it  s very limited intent  provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans  and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow  minded god  squadders and anti  god  squadders .  br    br   on the more thoughtful level  the film tempts us to speculate about carrey  s own career  stuck in his  comedy  typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes . his most accomplished  straight  role  the man on the moon  is less well known that his comedy romps  or the truman show  on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey  .  

=======================================================================================================

458 ===> i nominate this and babylon  as the best television sci  fi series made . both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series  there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters . if you look at the original star trek and star trektng  they were fine shows  but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes . in many ways  you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring . this was less the case with deep space   with its giant battles that took up all of the final season  and the other trek shows  as there was more of a larger story that unified them . this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon  and saw this to an even greater extent with sg   . the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form . sure  there were a few  throwaway  episodes that were not connected to the rest  but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny .  br    br   and speaking of funny  i loved that sg   kept the mood light from time to time and wasn  t so dreadfully serious . in this way  i actually enjoyed it more than babylon  . jack o  neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson   it  s really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons .  br    br   to truly appreciate sg    you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work . this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power . and  if you don  t like sg   after giving it a fair chance  then sci  fi is probably not the genre for you .  

=======================================================================================================

459 ===> i don  t understand how   of us  receive such a high rating . . . i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense  followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble . however  i did like jared harris  performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted  hours .  

=======================================================================================================

460 ===> lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent  who captures some exotic beauty named alexa  kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers . o . j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble . i must admit i  m not a fan of lorenzo lamas  or his movies . he stinks . however when compared to o . j simpson and lamas  comatose wife kinmont  lamas seems like ah  jean  claude van damme . i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the o . j simpson trial  you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels  you couldn  t escape this movie . in     you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv . the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o . j simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor . also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic   br    br    out of    bad   

=======================================================================================================

461 ===> jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask  a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck . even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums  and of course they have to be mexican  obviously   his good will towards his fellow man backfires . in that case  it wasn  t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums  but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn  t be ignored . i  m reminded of the episode of michael moore  s brilliant the awful truth  when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay . the results were not very promising  so it  s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example .  br    br   jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan  the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart . or even better  it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere  a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film  . bruce is nearly   years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that  s seeking to bake the world  s biggest cookie . he  s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station  but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague . you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report . needless to say  he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film .  br    br   morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself  displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman  s massive talent as an actor . he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously  but in such a way as to advise his followers  as well as the viewers of this movie  that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life . i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day . there are a lot of people in the world  maybe more than our share in america  who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans .  br    br   one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives  and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer  s religion . i  for example  tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live . but despite the fact that i don  t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time  i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie .  br    br   jim carrey  s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he  s come . if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura  both of which i loved  by the way  or a lot of what he did before he got into film  it  s amazing how far he  s come . he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show  man on the moon  and the majestic  easily one of his greatest films ever  . jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today .  br    br   jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie  as she did in the side  splitting office space  as bruce  s girlfriend  who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce  s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him . there is definitely some low  brow comedy in the film that doesn  t really fit with the importance of the film  s meaning or the quality of the delivery  such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene  but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura  s friend spike make a cameo appearance . as stephen king very well knows  it  s always nice to see familiar characters . it  s almost like seeing family again .  br    br   bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better  and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him . the thing i love about this is that  like i said before  religion is absent from my life  but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers . the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way  which empowers the message even more .  br    br   the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film  such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position  the jimmy hoffa scene  who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records   the scene where bruce  s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera  and my favorites  the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery  s cooking . the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes  such as when he says to god  who reveals that he  s the janitor  the proprietor  the electrician  etc  that his christmas parties must be real bashes  and to be careful about drinking  because on of him might need a ride home  i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes . a little too true  and as gallagher would add  behind every great man is also an amazed mother  in  law .  br    br   bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while  and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection . it is a comedy written and performed in good taste  but with enough relatively low  brow humor to keep the kids entertained . this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family  which is becoming rarer and rarer these days . in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie  which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy   it  s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching . don  t miss this one .  

=======================================================================================================

462 ===> as long as you go into this movie knowing that it  s terrible bad acting  bad  effects   bad story  bad . . . everything  then you  ll love it . this is one of my favorite  goof on  movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs   

=======================================================================================================

463 ===> as an impressionable   year old  i liked the  love conquers all  philosophy of the   s sitcom  bridget loves bernie .  i did understand the controversy  which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver  david birney  and an irish catholic school teacher  meredith baxter  and both sets of parents  harold j . stone and bibi osterwald as bernie  s parents audra lindley and david doyle as bridget  s parents  who have issues with the young couple  s interfaith marriage .  br    br   looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences  i am amazed that the show was even a success for one  albeit  highly  rated season . created by veteran tv writer bernard slade  who a few years after the show  s cancellation would write the successful play  same time  next year    bridget loves bernie  was a very light  superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight .  br    br   there was no denying the real  life chemistry between birney and baxter . but  in later years  both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects  birney in his short  lived role in  st . elsewhere  and baxter in  family  and  family ties   . here  they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge  which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject .  br    br   the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses  all in the family  and  mary tyler moore  . both of those shows were smart  funny and had enough of an edge  more so on the former that the latter  that kept my interest in the situation and the characters .  bridget loves bernie  was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles .  br    br   this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered .  

=======================================================================================================

464 ===> this film was hard to get a hold of  and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming . i mean  this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt . with all of this built  in interest  how could anyone make such a lackluster  talk  laden flick of this true  life event . while williams is always interesting  the screenwriters assumed that the d . b . cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star  s what we get is a type  without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off . harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty  but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction . shame on this film for even existing .  

=======================================================================================================

465 ===> this one and  her pilgrim soul  are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone . as i mentioned in my comment on the new series  there  s something lacking in this new series . maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned . it  s a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling  s version . however  this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too . i think the appeal is that no matter what they do  the lovers can never unite . i remember i wasn  t surprised by the korean movie  il mare   later remade into  the lake house  . i think it  s because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film .  

=======================================================================================================

466 ===> this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories  i note both of them are based on short stories  .  examination day  is set in the future  year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves  huge tv  looking  phones  that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age . . . and the examination day  a point where    year  olds must undergo a government  required iq test . the kid is this story  dickie jordan  david mendenhall  is just celebrating his own   th birthday and is a smart kid  so is calm  even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades . his parents  christopher allport and elizabeth norment   on the other hand  say he shouldn  t have used his birthday wish on getting a good score  and while their reason includes that they believe he  s capable and he should have no need to worry  it  s pretty obvious they are worried . i won  t give anything away in the ending  but i will say this  there  s a point where we get a glimpse of what  s to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening  or another   his parents ask dickie whether he  d prefer to watch tv all night . by today  s standards  we  d be pleased he  d say he  d rather read and not just because there  s nothing worth watching . . . but why would his family ask this  the flavor of what  s encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon  which i hear hasn  t received a great adaptation to the screen  . i only wish they could  ve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was . i found it to be better than the short story it was based on . i haven  t read the one that  a message from charity  was based on  but would like to since it was interesting  a    year  ld boy  peter  robert duncan mcneill  is suffering a fever from unclean water  that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown . . . but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever  charity payne   kerry noonann  who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him . they both recover  especially since it  s common for that to happen in      but the connection doesn  t go away . charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of     and they each enjoy each other  s company  especially peter  who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students  even at the college he  s been staying in one place at . things take an unexpected turn  though  when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the   colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment  added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever  not so common in      . the two try to learn a way to save her . the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching . both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times  through a lesson  warning that sounds like something rod sterling would  ve cooked up and entertainment  make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship  love  and wisdom do a great deal . probably    of this has no theme  but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling  s crew .  

=======================================================================================================

467 ===> i can  t believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny . shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty  disgust and stupidity   there  s something about mary  leaves little reason to stay until the end . sure  cameron diaz is very pretty  but that is never going to be enough to save a movie . ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot  and is obviously very talented  but the movie is a loser .  br    br   not once were any of the scenes believable . the shots were badly timed and poorly framed . the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs . i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid .  br    br        the bonus is from the one time i smiled . it  s not like i  m immune to humor or alone in my opinion . my wife hated it  too . the next day we saw  rush hour  and laughed ourselves silly . this movie just stunk .  

=======================================================================================================

468 ===> to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite . i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn  t mean it is a terrorist thing . it also show  s how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype  by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn  t mean we are all bad we just try to live  day at a time  like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like  blow up  or yaser saying we  ll blow away the competition  and people took it the wrong way . being a muslim i know that stuff like this don  t usually happen  but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq  its not right things are not like that . people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act . i am glad a show like this came on the air . there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists  many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair  but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name .  

=======================================================================================================

469 ===> you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies  even the really bad ones  why  to see their heroes in action one more time . that  s the way i feel about doc savage . i am a major fanatic for the character  and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming . and the first   minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation . then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie  resulting in a somewhat disjointed film . there  s a lot of promise in here  diluted by a number of unfortunate choices  the music  the  camp  elements  etc .  but the spirit of doc is there  and that  s what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to . so  in my long  winded way  what i  m trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it  s just not as good as it should have been . and anyone who is a fan of superman  james bond  indiana jones  buckaroo banzai  and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all .

470 ===> it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression . it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace . a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball .  br    br   likewise  an occasional excursion of  or  hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema . the presence of a radio in just about everyone  s house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world  s events and provided many a drama and  especially  comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality .  br    br   the literature of the time also flourished at all levels . the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it  what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures . but the comic book just did not magically appear  all fully developed with all the colorful  color pages  all by itself . there were mediums that were ancestral to them . obviously  the newspaper comic strip was one parent  providing the visual  narrative method of story telling .  br    br   the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine . the inexpensive  prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going  though not necessarily serialized  tales . the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough  s tarzan and johnston mcculley  s zorro . the      s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow  the avenger  g   s battle aces and the spider  master of men all found their way to the news stands  among many others .  br    br   one other was doc savage  a full  blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps  the only  picture  of the hero . possessing extraordinary strength  super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect  doc was the prototype super hero .  br    br   he also assembled  of his former army buddies into a small  free lancing team of adventurers . each of them was an expert in a given field . so we had a top rated chemist  lawyer  construction engineer  electrical engineer  geologist  archaeologist  paleontologist  etc .  br    br   the doc savage stories were very popular in the      s and     s  and were published into the middle     s . then they went into a hiatus for a good      years . then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new  container   the paperback book . a fresh look to the cover art was introduced  featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc  with a perpetually ripped shirt .  br    br   the re  introduction proved to be highly successful  with the publication of a title a month  and for a while more  . soon  there was a rumor of a doc savage movie  but when  by what producer  well  the venerable  man of bronze  was back on the news stands for over   years before any real project got put together . it was veteran stop  action animator and producer of top special effects films  geoprge pal  who did the film along with warner brothers .  br    br   when doc savage  man of bronze arrived in the movie houses  it boasted of a well casted team of actors  albeit a largely  no name  as far familiarity with the viewers . with former tarzan of tv  ron ely  s nearly perfect casting in the lead  up and coming beauty of a starlette  pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler  as the villainous  captain seas   no other name would have been recognized . and  just maybe that was a plus in this case .  br    br   the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going . use of narration  by paul frees  and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story .  br    br   from the very start  there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured  camp  humor as the batman tv series . some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected  unlikely outcomes .  for example  an experiment of doc  s with a miniature rocket  missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish  a small one at that .  the whole story unfolds like that  hitting the viewer with a little  camp  every so often  as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously . we are also puzzled about mr . george pal  s being the producer  his last  . he who had been so well known for special effects  surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci  fi action setting of the pulp character  s world .  br    br   i can remember seeing it quite vividly . mrs . ryan  deanna  was in the hospital  just having given birth to our  nd child  michelle           . our older girl  jennifer  was visiting her grandmother  so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward  it was straight over to the old marquette theatre    rd  kedzie  here in chicago .  br    br   having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc  i was sort of let down by the final product . i could accept a little of this  camp  business  but would not have objected if mr . pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp  comic  serial type excitement .  br    br   and yet  the cast  headed  up by mr . ely and the others  made the whole film likable  if not lovable . the sets and locations were  as far as we can see  very much like those of a     s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone .  br    br   and maybe that  s just what they were trying for with this doc savage  man of bronze .

471 ===> who likes awful  comedy  shows like little mosque on the prairie  the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are one  muslims and self  proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn  t even matter if the show is good or funny at all  which it is not  . two  old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable  badly written  stale jokes .  br    br   cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is . if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen  their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left . i  d be curious who even writes for this show  do you think it  s actually muslims  or hip  funny young people  no  i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the      s .  br    br   when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are  air farce was only finally just taken off the air  thank goodness   but we still have lame ducks like this hour has   minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for  not to mention this poor excuse for  comedy  little mosque on the prairie . it is supposed to be offencive and funny  only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny . shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching .  

=======================================================================================================

472 ===> unlike many  i don  t find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive . its execution  however  is another matter entirely . like so many b  minus movies  all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers . for most of the    or  so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor . or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers . with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical over  emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late  night infomercial  but not a primetime sitcom  even a canadian one .  notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle  i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas . unfortunately  they got the tone   and the script   completely wrong for the prairies . the final insult is that they apparently couldn  t even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town  why  are they so hard to find in saskatchewan   did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors  as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon  and that the rest of the world  primed by the cbc  s publicists  quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom .

473 ===> this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate . it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention . such as  how was the stargate activated without a human computer  where did the goa  uld  ra  s race  come from  how many are there   br    br   the first episode has a retired jack o  neill  spelled with  ls  recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis  a powerful goa  uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman . we meet samantha carter  a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time  and is determined to go through now . we find out that daniel got married on abydos  and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial . then daniel  s wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen .  br    br   it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams  in which jack  s team will be sg   which consists of jack  samantha and daniel . they go to chulak  a goa  uld homeworld to rescue daniel  s wife and another one captured at abydos named ska  ra . they get captured  and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners  a jaffa named teal  c  first prime of apophis  saves them and goes to earth with them  where he is made part of sg   .  br    br   that was only the beginning of the adventure . in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future  gotten transported to alternate realities  swapped bodies  grown old  met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa  uld called the tok  ra  in which samantha  s dad becomes a member  the asgard  a cute little race in which we see thor most often  he  s jack  s buddy   and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times .  br    br   the show was recently canceled  but lasted ten seasons . in season nine  a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers  new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators  the ancients . season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters  ben browder as cameron mitchell  the new leader of sg   and claudia black as vala maldoran  a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team .  br    br   very well  produced  interesting characters  fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack  this one has it all . a different way of travelling the galaxy  and different kinds of adventures  this is one show you don  t want to miss . unlock the gate and step through . you won  t regret it

474 ===> possible spoilers  br    br   i recently watched this movie with my   year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences . ron ely is just right as doc . cool  calm  almost always in control  and with an occasional twinkle in his eye  . what more can one ask for  i have never read a doc savage book  so i don  t know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring  do . many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark  which i don  t think is fair . the difference in budget is astounding  raiders must have at least   times the budget  . doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has . special effects are also at a minimum but come on people  the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right . the sousa music is catchy  love that theme song  every time i watch the film  i end up humming the theme for days  . the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy . highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas . not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib  really   . overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day . i give it  out of   .  br    br   doc savage  doc savage . . . thank the lord he  s here

475 ===> i was really hoping that this would be a funny show  given all the hype and the clever preview clips . and talk about hype  i even heard an interview with the show  s creator on the bbc world today  a show that is broadcast all over the world .  br    br   unfortunately  this show doesn  t even come close to delivering . all of the jokes are obvious  the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame  and they are not given any new treatment or twist . all of the characters are one  dimensional . the acting is  well  mediocre  i  m being nice  . it  s the classic cbc recipe  one that always fails .  br    br   if you  re muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters  and if you  re white you  d probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted  ignorant  or both . not that making fun of white people is a problem  most of the better comedies are rooted in that . it  s only a problem when it isn  t funny  as in this show .  br    br   canada is bursting with funny people  so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis . so how come the producers of this show couldn  t find any   

=======================================================================================================

476 ===> this show is terrible  the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse . i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two  all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them . well at least corner gas was good at first  little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode  . who are the people who are watching this show anyway  i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies  maybe the jokes are for them and they work there  i don  t know a single person who likes this show and can  t stand it myself  the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas . hopefully it won  t last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could  should have led to a great show .  

=======================================================================================================

477 ===> the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the    s  created concept that comic books could only be done as  camp   i . e .  the    s batman show  for tv and movie . thus you have combat sequences with subtitles  come on    a cluelessly unromantic doc savage  he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps  not an idiot   monk mayfair in a nightsheet  a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights   and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute . and when they  re not doing booming sousa march scores  the tinkly little  funny  music undercuts much of the drama .  br    br   even as such  this movie is . . . okay . it  s fun  and when it stays serious it  s a very accurate representation of the pulps . except for monk  as has been mentioned before he  s hugely muscled  not obese . and long tom  who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude  not paul gleason with an  inexplicable  scarf .  br    br   the green death sequences  for instance  are remarkably gruesome and not something i  d recommend for children . but they are very close to the feel of the pulps . when the writers and producers get it right  they do get it right  i  ll give them that .  br    br   but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of  say  reeves  first two superman movies  think what we might have had then . i think the problem is the movie  s schizophrenic . there  s a definite sense of trying to do a    s homage  but they  re also trying to give in to the  heroes must be camp  attitude that batman created . one gets the impression there was a sober  pulp  style first draft and then someone came in and said   hey  let  s make it funny  it worked with the batman show  years ago    br    br   but doc lives on  thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai . if macrauch ain  t doing a homage to doc savage in that movie  the man is truly demented . so when the series actually gets on tv  allegedly mid  season in         doc savage  updated to the    s  will live once more .  

=======================================================================================================

478 ===> this is a very entertaining movie . a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who  apparently  think that the film was an effort at serious drama . it was not made that way . . . . it is an extremely enjoyable film  performed in a tongue in cheek manner . all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us . the fight sequences are lively  brisk and  above all  not gratuitous . the so  called  green death   utilized on a couple of occasions  is not  as i read in one review   gruesome  . a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film . hey  lighten up . . . again  i remind one and all that this is a fun film . each phase of this  fight  was captioned  which added to the fun aspect . the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan . this is not one of those martial arts films . ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc . another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the  bad guy   seas  is dealt with . i promise you that if you don  t try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value  you will spend    minutes in a most enjoyable manner .  

=======================================================================================================

479 ===> i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all . the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it  s getting talked about  i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason  they are usually true . but there really wasn  t anything funny about these stereotypical characters . the  fresh of the boat  dad  who doesn  t understand his daughter . the radical feminist muslim daughter  who by the way is a terrible actress   and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can  he  s a pretty good actor  i only see him getting better  .  br    br   it is very contrived and the dialog doesn  t flow that well . there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed  and don  t really care to watch another episode .  br    br   i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again  she  s always a treat and a natural at everything she does  too bad her daughter in the show doesn  t have the same acting abilities   

=======================================================================================================

480 ===> little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen . they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most  easily  offended viewers which for cbc means   year old farmers in saskatchewan . the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can  t believe it . the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don  t blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded . very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as  controversial  well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has   minutes  royal canadian air farce and rick mercer  s report .  

=======================================================================================================

481 ===> i was brought up on doc savage  and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now  i found it thoroughly entertaining . i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions  granted they mostly think i  m odd but there you are .  i don  t know what it is about the doc  but he always gets the girls  has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men . this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre  and was way before it  s time  it is not to be taken seriously  move over austin powers . ron ely is a god . it is unfortunate that this film hasn  t been released on dvd in the uk . i don  t think it should be remade and bastardised  like i said it  s a classic  it cannot be done without ron .  like the italian job without mini  s and michael caine  . i give it      .  

=======================================================================================================

482 ===> we so often talk of cinema landmarks  kane  the godfather  a bout de souffle . one film however is too often overlooked by  serious  film critics . i am talking of course about the classic doc savage  m . o . b .   br    br   this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism . not to mention kung  fu .  br    br   it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history  until of course queen  s breathtaking work on flash gordon  . although a bit of a rarity  this film is well worth seeking out  it will repay the effort of your search ten  fold .  

=======================================================================================================

483 ===> once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode .  br    br   last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter . how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists  ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses . but not   minutes . it  s called beating a dead horse . even snl would know to give up after a commercial break .  br    br   also  let  s have a little conflict in these scripts . will she or won  t she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan  when will ramadan start  ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here .  br    br   and the characters  what characters   they are all cardboard cut  outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next . that  s the point of the situation comedy . we need to have strong  interesting  dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week . we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they  re going to get into next week . if i never see these characters it  ll be too soon . thankfully i can  t remember any of their names  note to cbc  that  s not a good sign  .  br    br   and the acting is so bland . it  s more so a problem in casting than in the actors . none of these people actually embody the characters they play . they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week . sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character  make us fall in love with them  where they become inseparable from the character the portray . watch any american sitcom and you  ll see how easily identifiable characters are . part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next  years portraying . that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows . but to be honest  considering the lame concept and the horrible writing  there  s not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture . as another commenter mentions  this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom .  br    br   and the directing or lack there of  what can i say  canada has so much talent  look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up . look at the trailer park boys  not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog  . look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that  s where many of our stars go to find decent work .  br    br   give credit to the cbc  they really know how to build publicity for a non  event . remember  the one   no  well don  t even try to learn any characters names in this show  as it  s sure to go the way of the dodo .  br    br   let  s all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while .  

=======================================================================================================

484 ===> this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news  sports  or satirical sketch comedy . as a developer of situation comedy  cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of  king of kensington  with the belly laughs of  the beachcombers  . it is an embarrassment to great shows like  kids in the hall  and  second city  that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production .  br    br   i have to admit  that i didn  t give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept . to start  half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip  off one of the few sitcom successes in english  canadian history   corner gas  . the rest of the concept   the cultural clash   is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness . the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the  fish out of water  characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be  edgy  and  topical   but comes off as forced . some of the jokes that are based around the local  s reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved  especially the audience .  br    br   this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn  t  get it  when it comes to creating canadian content  especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment . cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy  handed and forced way . it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity . i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle . a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas   i . e . the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines . more realistically  their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics .  br    br   that being said  even as a formulaic fish  out  of  water comedy this show fails . the acting is weak  the comic pacing all over the map  and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief  even for a comedy . the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath  who is horribly wasted here . i doubt that even the addition of guest stars  colin mochrie  for example  as an anglican archbishop  can save this dog . i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc  s  hype  had died down but two episodes were all i could stand   i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline . the time  slot would be better served by airing more coronation street  air farce re  runs  or dr . who . even an infomercial would be an improvement .  

=======================================================================================================

485 ===> the makers have chosen the best people for the job  and set the scene wonderfully . every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it . whether the period is the   s  the first story   the present  ie      for the middle story  or the     s  the last   costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created . i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium  exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls . roland culver as ashenden is very appealing  but never mind the soppy young lovers  it  s raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife  s health and independence who harrows our emotions . he usually played comical  pompous types  but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive . the china seas  great   s film starring gable and harlow  stole the plot from the mr know all episode  and also nicked a story by kipling  . i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband  though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat . i love that posh bird who plays his wife  too .  

=======================================================================================================

486 ===> trio  s vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable . it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young . the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch .  br    br   observation . in film it isn  t necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile .  small morality  storytelling is quaint  or coy  only in the eye of the beholder   thankfully . story content   well told   can overcome it  s time  subject or place .  br    br   ironically  there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era . inserting  small morality  content   occasionally   might provide a dimension lacking .

487 ===> i  m trying to picture the pitch for dark angel .  i  m thinking matrix  i  m thinking bladerunner  i  m thinking that chick that plays faith in angel  wearing shiny black leather  or some chick just like her  leave that one with us . only  get this   we  ll do it without any plot  dialogue  character  decent action or budget  just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike . fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes  right    br    br   flashy  shallow  dreary  formulaic  passionless  tedious  dull  dumb  humourless  desultory  barely competent . live action anime without any action  or indeed any life . sf just the way joe fanboy likes it  in fact .    

=======================================================================================================

488 ===> while i have never been a fan of the original scooby  doo  due to its horrid production values   it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hanna  barbera  without a doubt  scrappy  doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children  and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm  . whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby  doo characters with it   whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show  i think death is preferable  . the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny  annoying and grates on the nerves   and this is only in the better episodes   after many years  it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess  i can see why in the live  action scooby  doo movie they made the villain scrappy  doo   since practically everyone hates him   

=======================================================================================================

489 ===> this is actually a trilogy of  of somerset maugham  s short tales . the first one is the verger  which is about   minutes long and very enjoyable . after   years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can  t read nor write . so what does he do  opens a tobacco shop  of course   br    br   the second is mr . know  all which was actually a story i had read for school  years ago and instantly forgotten  until i heard the familiar introduction . another   minute one  and also very good . it worked better on film than in a book for me  but then perhaps that  s because i was only   the last time  afterall .  br    br   the  rd one is nearly a let  down . almost an hour in length  it simply drags . it  s not all that bad  but not as quick and snappy as the last  . i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour  and found that it still made sense and really i hadn  t missed a thing   br    br   overall i give them     and  out of    respectively .  

=======================================================================================================

490 ===> made after quartet was  trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham . here the three stories are the verger  mr . know  it  all  and sanitorium . the first two are comic  the verger is like a prolonged joke  but one with a good pay  off   and the last more serious  as health issues are involved  . again the author introduces the film and the stories .  br    br   james hayter  soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick  is the hero in the verger . he holds this small custodial  type job in a church  but the new vicar  michael hordern  is an intellectual snob . when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him . hayter has saved some money  so he tells his wife  kathleen harrison  he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop . he has a good eye  and his store thrives . soon he has a whole chain of stores . when his grandchild is christened by hordern  the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex  verger . the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments . i  ll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting .  br    br   according to maugham he met a man like max kelada  nigel patrick  on a cruise . in mr . know  it  all kelada is a splashy  friendly  and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip  regarding jewelry  by steamship . his state  room mate is mr . grey  the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde  white  who is somewhat  silently disapproving of max . max likes to enliven things  and soon is heavily involved in the ship  s entertainment . at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non  maugham story and film china seas        as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake  after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real  . i won  t describe the way max rises to the occasion .  br    br   sanitorium is the longest segment . roland culver plays  ashenden   the fictional alter  ego of maugham  a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock  s the secret agent  . here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health . he finds a remarkable crew of people  including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman  finlay currie as an irascible scotsman  john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is  at war  with currie  raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up  and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness . culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions . the last  dealing with simmons and rennie  is ironic but deeply moving .  br    br   it was a dandy follow  up to the earlier quartet  and well worth watching .

491 ===> god  i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot . i had been expecting a lot from it  as i  m a huge fan of james cameron  and not just since  titanic   i might add   and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality  then again  he also wrote the leaden strange days . .  . but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration . in all that time  it barely went beyond its two line synopsis  and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere . on top of that  i don  t think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular  a  team  episode . as for alba  yes  she is gorgeous  of course  but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie  pouty and surly   makes me also get bored of her  gal wit an attitude  schtick pretty soon . you can count me out of this one  mr . cameron   

=======================================================================================================

492 ===> awful  simply awful . it proves my theory about  star power .  this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed  battlestar  titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick . b o r i n g .  br    br   find something a thousand times more interesting to do  like watch your tv with no picture and no sound .      i rated it so high b  c there aren  t any negative scores in the imdb . com rating system .   br    br    zaphoid  br    br   ps my theory about  star power  is the more  star power  used in a show  the weaker the show is .  it  s called an indirect proportionality quality    star power   less  sp  makes for better quality  etc . another way to look at it is  more is less .    br    br    z

493 ===> this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed . while late     and into     would reveal just how evil and horrific they were  this film  unlike other hollywood films to date  is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities .  br    br   the film begins in a courtroom in the future   after the war is over  the film was made in       the war ended in may       . in this fictitious world court  a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes . wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm  s life since     in a series of flashbacks . at first  it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis . however  after a while  it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster . these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama .  br    br   all in all  the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second  tier actors . there are many compelling scenes and performances   especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can  t help but bring you close to tears . it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super  creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first . overall  it  s a must  see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film .  br    br   fyi   this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film  but hitler was referred to as  that paper hanger  . this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper . this is in fact not true   previously he  d been a  starving artist   homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi . a horrible person  yes  but never a paper hanger   

=======================================================================================================

494 ===> never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example norway . the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates . alexander knox   wilhelm gimm   gorky park  returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town . he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either . as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind . marsha hunt   marja pacierkowski    chloe  s prayer   played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm . there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people  s families and their entire lives . the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers . if you have not seen this film  and like this subject matter  give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a     film and a story you will not forget too quickly .  

=======================================================================================================

495 ===> a story of amazing disinterest kills  the psychic  over and over again . the characters and plot are completely uninteresting  as is fulci  s mad camera work  which is usually a redeeming factor in his films   and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found . it  s padded out to an insufferable degree   by the end  you won  t be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom  and  like me  maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep  . jennifer o  neill  s performance deserves occupancy in a better movie . fulci gorehounds beware   there  s just not much going on in  the psychic .   br    br        

=======================================================================================================

496 ===> average  and surprisingly tame  fulci giallo which means it  s still quite bad by normal standards  but redeemed by its solid build  up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance .  br    br   the genre  s well  known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue  wooden acting  illogical plot points . and the finale goes on much too long  while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair .  br    br   fulci  s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing  though . yellow clues wherever you look .  br    br    out of   limping killers  

=======================================================================================================

497 ===> this one is tough to watch   as an earlier reviewer says . that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii   particularly the  liberation  of dachau . it is clear that  as of the middle of the war  we knew exactly what was happening to the jews . the sequence that shows a  transport  is vivid  almost as if based upon an actual newsreel  the nazis liked to record their atrocities  . knox as the nazi is brilliant . he charts the course of a nazi career . that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans  at first laughing at hitler  then incredulous  and finally helpless . that contrast  however  permits us to believe in the  conversion  of one young nazi officer to an anti  nazi stance . that did happen  as witness the several attempts against hitler  most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out . a strong film  effectively using flashbacks  accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended .  

=======================================================================================================

498 ===> this movie was extremely funny  i would like to own this for my vintage collection of     s movie must see again list  i know this cast of characters  they are people that i have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy  unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs . redd foxx always a clown of comedy  pearl baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy  norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out  dennis dugan crazy funny man . miss dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience . love  lust  strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance  situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake  i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible  except jerry seinfeld playing dennis dugan role  this earmarks a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you  keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent . this movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie  remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer .  episode from seinfeld  the parents have there jaw dropping moment  fun over fun it is screaming bring me back .  

=======================================================================================================

499 ===> man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy . now most of the rest of the film was okay . it had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing . yes alderich is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby jane among others . the problem isn  t with direction  acting or anything technical . the movie is just destroyed in the third act . why  the murders  twists  turns and characters have all been revolving around nuclear material  what the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that  the way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest deus ex machina in history . for all the complaints about burton  s planet of the apes  the life of david gale or notorious i think this is the worst ending ever . what a let down .  

=======================================================================================================

500 ===> this movie is just plain dumb .  br    br   from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax  the film is an exercise in wooden predictability .  br    br   mike hammer is one of detective fiction  s true sociopaths . unlike marlow and spade  who put pieces together to solve the mystery  hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth . this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are . . . well  too dumb to get away with anything . one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack .  br    br   other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book . velda  s dance at the barre  for instance  or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back . and the continuity breaks are shameful frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she  s way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot . the worst break  however  precedes the popcorn attack . the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero  except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy .  br    br   to be fair  there were some interesting camera angles and lighting  and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen  which is the only reason that it gets two points out of   .

501 ===> i saw a trailer for this on afro promo  the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african  americans . it looked like what it is a highly tendentious  wacky  comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay . it would seem that redd foxx  s  rf  wife has left him for his brother  who works with him at  the store  back in phoenix . he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles .  br    br   so as rf arrives  norman  wearing nothing but powder  blue bikini shorts  gets out of his waterbed to answer the door . trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the   th floor  norman tries to wake his lover  who steadfastly refuses to budge . it was just to the point where i wrote  why won  t he wake up   when suddenly he does  and me and my friend  s jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue  eyed  swirl  hairdoed garson  norman  s white live  in lover  who just  had the most faaaaaabulous dream  garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from     l . a . he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry  and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch .  br    br   norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father  s visit . garson goes to stay with waylon flowers  and madam answers the phone when norman calls .  br    br   so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico . while he is on the phone  garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him . with a burst of   s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation  but sounding more like we  re about to hear a very special track by the emotions   he realizes that his son is gay .  br    br   his first impulse is  i  ll kill him . i  ll kill him .  then rf goes on a long walk  wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have  such as  maybe we toilet trained him too soon .  his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk  for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man . surprisingly  he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality . this  it must be said  is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought . he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all   br    br   rf then hires audrey  a six  foot amazon prostitute  in this amazing fur thing  played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones . he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality  but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody .  br    br   then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night . he commiserates over the loss of rf  s wife  and tells the tale of his own mother  who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because  she was molested at a luau .  they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam  which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose . once more  mouths were agape .  br    br   so it seems that  wouldn  t ya just know it  rf and garson have a wonderful evening together  you see  staid  traditional older black men just have to see the crappy  highly  effeminate entertainment of mega  queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer  it  s really just that simple  this still does not prevent rf from yelling  rape   when garson wakes him from a bad dream . it ends less predictably than you  d think .  br    br   there was so much that was just off . what is the basis of norman and garson  s relationship  they don  t seem to have any rapport  and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out  and even when he comes around to stand up for himself  he never defends garson or talks about their relationship . there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality  and sitting right down on the park bench to read them  i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality  rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends .  br    br   other than that  it  s kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era  an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance  we could all learn to love and understand one another  and because of the whole naivet of this thing  the extreme stereotypes and message  laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated  and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past   years . i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays  female friends are desperately in love with them  and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with  and by extension convert  them .  br    br

502 ===> say what you will about schmaltz . one beauty of this film is that it is not pro  american . it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion . it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose .  br    br   to me  the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly  bette davis  mother and brother  . as fanny says   we  ve been shaken out of the magnolias .   br    br   in today  s political climate where  led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used     to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings  we sunk to the level of the     murderers to seek blood  thirsty vengeance . it can  t all be blamed on mr . bush  after all  we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re  elected him after his lies had been exposed . now  with complete justification  we americans are reviled throughout the world .  br    br   today  we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character  but  a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts . i  m not comparing george bush to adolph hitler . but  i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror  hatred  and hyper  nationalism to do despicable things .  br    br   sadly  the blackmailer  who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement  no matter how immoral  is most like the leaders of our country  those who support them  and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand  that they can  t even be bothered to vote .  br    br   a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be  a force for the betterment of humanity  and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals .  br    br   geoff

503 ===> i grew up on scooby doo where are you  and i still love it . it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck  talespin  peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry . this show though is good for kids  the voices are good  don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy   the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation . however it is rather disappointing . i normally don  t mind scrappy  but when he appears to be like the main character  it gets annoying fast . complete with the catchphrase puppy power  scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual . also half the gang are missing after the first year  somehow it didn  t feel like scooby doo . and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal  very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies . all in all  not as bad as shaggy and scooby dooget a clue  but this show is disappointing .     for the animation  voices  theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids . bethany cox  

=======================================================================================================

504 ===> this is one of the worst films i  ve ever seen . i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel  and i wish i hadn  t . i turned it off after a little less than an hour  though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes . i wish i had . it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors . unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last   or so minutes  which would be impossible  i would in no way recommend this . its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the   th century . i don  t think  as many people say that it is  that  the bell jar  is necessarily unfilmable  but this particular rendition could have been done without . i  d almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice .  

=======================================================================================================

505 ===> a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid   s this film was a huge hit for about  minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth . i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish high anxiety  the cheap detective  the black bird  don  t look now we  re being shot at . . . . . . . . . . and have no profile at all today . norman was the comedy of the month in whenever     and everyone seemed to see it  laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again . famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film  an experiment at the time  norman is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that the farrelly brothers should look at remaking today . if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either . it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong . just as it should be . in fact as a groovy     film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today .  

=======================================================================================================

506 ===> melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which  this time  he inhabits the role of a detective who can  t place love before duty and adventure  and the warmly beautiful joan blondell  who  far from being illiterate  as one reviewer suggested  wrote a novel about her early life  is as enjoyable as ever as his ever  suffering sweetheart . it  s almost a screwball comedy  almost a thin man  type movie  almost a series  i guess  that didn  t quite make it to a sequel . it doesn  t quite reach classic status  but it has all the ingredients for a fun   minutes with an episodic but pacey script  fine character actors  and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don  t notice that williams  douglas  isn  t exactly columbo when it comes to detecting . i wish there were more films like this .  

=======================================================================================================

507 ===> jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen  s most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin . larry peerce  s direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy . robert klein certainly think it  s the former and his self  centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film . normally  i don  t like to let myself get so ascerbic  but the bell jar is one of my all  time favorite books  and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy .  

=======================================================================================================

508 ===> the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the   s . this show quack pack shouldn  t even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales . it  s about a teen  aged huey  dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip  hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales . i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales . there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg . there  s no references of scrooge mcduck . the stories are repetitive  the plot is boring but the animation is good . if you want lots of slapstick humor  i recommend this to you . if you want a better disney show watch  darkwing duck  or  ducktales  .  

=======================================================================================================

509 ===> melvyn douglas and joan blondell co  star in  the amazing mr . williams   a     mystery  comedy that  s quite good  although forgotten  probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in     .  br    br   douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job  while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed . what happens in this film is no exception  he  s called to a murder scene just as he  s about to walk down the aisle yet again .  br    br   both stars were excellent at comedy  worked together well  and often   and help make this battle of the sexes fun . edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support .  br    br   as you can read in other reviews  melvyn douglas doesn  t make much of a woman .  br    br   entertaining if a little on the long side .  br    br   one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas  one of our greatest actors . he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man . he wasn  t lazy  but rather  a very hard  working actor  who made it look easy  who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career . he just wasn  t cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system . i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in  hud  and  i never sang for my father  and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk .  

=======================================================================================================

510 ===> the only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself . i usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie i don  t know much about . it  s unfortunate when there aren  t many comments for a certain tile  because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast  you don  t get an idea of what to expect . i read the review before watching this title and i don  t know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from . douglas and blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered  even when the material was not the greatest . i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable . it isn  t one of the great all  time classics  but a pleasant and funny diversion  much more than you can hope for in most newer movies . if you are a fan of these stars  you will not be disappointed .  

=======================================================================================================

511 ===> by     columbia was a full  fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm  paramount or warners . that  s the best thing that could be said about  adam had four sons   a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman  top  billed for the first time in an american film  and warner baxter . bergman plays a frenchwoman  this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another  hired as governess to baxter  s four sons and staying on  with one interruption caused by the stock  market crash of      until the boys are grown men serving in world war i . just about everyone in the movie is so goody  good it  s a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she  s about the only watchable person in the movie even though she  s clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh it  s also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous . no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted  the valley of decision  four years later .  

=======================================================================================================

512 ===> you  d think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better . sadly  the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain  addled .  br    br   the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family . everything is so very peachy and swell   the family adores bergman and things couldn  t be more perfect . well  that is until the mother  fay wray  dies  the stock market crashes in      wiping out the family  s fortune  and bergman is forced to go back home to france . this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet  but not bad .  br    br   later  after the family  s fortunes have improved  bergman returns . the four boys are now all grown and there isn  t really a conceivable reason why they  d hire her once again as a governess . but  briefly  everything is swell once again . but  when wwi occurs  the four all go to war   gosh  in the midst of this  one of the sons  david  brings home his new wife  susan hayward  . miss hayward  s character is as black and white as the others  though while they are all good and swell  she  s obviously a horny she  devil . to make things worse  she comes to live in the family home while david is at war .  br    br   now here is where the movie gets really  really dumb   brain  achingly dumb . hayward begins an affair with one of david  s brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers  bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her  not hayward with jack  why   why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman  this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter  snipe once and for all  this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad . . . and most likely did the same to the audiences back in     .  br    br   the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward  s evilness to be exposed . this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess . as expected  however  the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again    happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut  hayward .  br    br   the film suffers because of poor writing . hayward  s affair made no sense   at least in how it was handled . and  having characters who are so gosh  darn good or evil  with nothing in between  sinks this movie to the level of a second  rate soap . the only thing that saves it at all is the acting    they tried as best they could with a turgid script . suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken

513 ===> delightful minor film  juggling comedy and detective  romance and drama genres as nimbly as lt kenny williams  melvyn douglas  balances his devotion to his girl maxine carroll  joan blondell  and his duty to the force as an ace detective .  br    br   this hodge  podge may not appeal to all viewers today  but in its day  it had something to offer every member of the movie  going family  and the resolution to the rather tired feeling  versus  duty plot is original and refreshing  and well worth the wait .  br    br    the amazing mr . williams  contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history  and its bright comic repartee sparkles . ludicrously frocked  melvyn douglas delivers some of the best lines  i  d walk down main street in a turkish towel before i  d let any woman control my life   and the effervescent joan blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb  good grief  you look like my aunt nellie    br    br   the crime  solving here is standard fare  although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life .  br    br   from today  s vantage point   the amazing mr . williams  is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct  all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries . while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes  at times it is both subtle and penetrating  playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film  but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene .

514 ===> this movie is very good . the screenplay is enchanting . but meryl streep is most impressive . her performance is excellent . she brings me to go into the heart of her role .  

=======================================================================================================

515 ===> i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever . i didn  t realize it was disney until it was too late . i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story . it was as if someone made a movie out of a  th grader  s book report on the novel . meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses . mrs murray  meg  s mother  was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet . and that  s just the beginning . by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen  much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn  t read the book . i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one . the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book  this movie is kinda alright .  

=======================================================================================================

516 ===> first of all  i am a huge fan of madeleine l  engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books  a wrinkle in time . this movie  however  ruined that excitement for me . i am sorry  but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool . in the movie  she has straight hair and no glasses and is the  sporty type  with a deep voice . this is not how madeleine l  engle pictured meg to be at all . in fact  meg was based on madeleine  s character and depicted the way she felt when she was young . this is just one major example how the book and movie are different . so i would say  if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes  watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l  engle and her wrinkle in time series  i would suggest skipping this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

517 ===> i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in      though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness . the film is set in       just before the entry of the us into the war . paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family . he  s a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture . bette davis is his very understanding and long  suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time . as the film begins  they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years  they are going to relax and stop running .  br    br   the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent   making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems . while this had a very noble goal at the time  it just seems phony today . in particular  the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn  t ring true . it sounded more like anti  fascism speeches than the voices of real children . they were as a result extremely annoying   particularly the littlest one who came off  at times  as a brat . about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them  though he had no discernible accent  .  br    br   it  s really tough to believe that the ultra  famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog  as it just doesn  t sound true to life . the story was based on the play by his lover  lillian hellman . and  the basic story idea and plot is good  . . . but the dialog is just bad at times . overall  an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments  . . . but that  s really about all .  

=======================================================================================================

518 ===> i believe they were telling the truth the whole time . . u cant trust anything in the wild . . . they family went through hell . those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them . but still having to deal with the rumours . as well as dealing with the lose of their little sister . i cant believe this case went on for so long . seems like the jury couldn  t see the truth  even if it bit them on the ass . i feel for this family  and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them  i would . i have no idea what they went through  i cant even imagine it . after watching this movie  i was in tears  and had to check on my little girl in bed . . . i think everyone should watch this .  

=======================================================================================================

519 ===> we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books . while not particularly accurate adaptations  these movies were nonetheless excellent films . some great examples are the harry potter series  the lord of the rings trilogy  and  to a lesser extent  almost every disney film ever made . however  i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies . not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l  engle  s fan base  it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting  acting  special effects and  ultimately  respect for the audience . mind you  i  m not trying to be mean on the contrary  i went into this affair with an open mind . i figured that a made  for  t . v . movie would make up for its lack of razzle  dazzle in its script . after all  the star wars spin  off ewoks was decent  if a little silly . come to think of it  the original star wars was made on  a lunch money budget   and look where it took george lucas  however  from the first scene onward  disappointment started enveloping me as if i  d gotten too close to the black thing while tessering .  br    br   the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of      a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic   mrs . whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time . the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief . aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard  star trek first contact and radio  as our favorite star  turned  mentor  the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow . that  s right  a crow . moreover  the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight  year  old the majestic half  man  half  horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle . had i been five  this would have psychologically traumatized me for life . the worst part is the fact that when it spoke  it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync  resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single  unmoving cheek  thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e . t .  br    br   having gotten the most painful part out of the way  i must go on to the tear  inducing one the characters  the acting  and the story . i  personally  had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair  glasses  and a figure most supermodels would find laughable . she was always a slightly anxious  humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua . in the film  she is an unpleasant know  it  all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever . in fact  she makes me feel sorry for poor mr . jenkins  her school principal  who continuously has to deal with her . calvin  the kind  intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock  the irony is horrible . as for the memorable happy medium  they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is  above gender  and likes to look at  funny  things  such as girls falling off of swings . the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace  mrs . whatsit and the man with red eyes  nicknamed  the dude with red eyes  due to his complete reinvention as a character  .  br    br   the story is a mess . a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  which didn  t do a good job of retelling the story found in the book  yet kept the sole of the original work . here  the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld  apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed . as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen  the flat  nosed wookies of ixchel  who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks  tear the spine up . as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth  like camazotz was  the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil .  br    br   i am very sorry that this film exists . i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad . it  s the way the characters are written that ruins it . a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan  directed by george lucas or steven spielberg  enhanced at industrial light and magic  scored by john williams  given its sound at skywalker sound  edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox . in its current state  the film is unworthy to be shown to self  respecting people . even madeleine l  engle thought it was bad . the book was good  the film was bad  and mrs . whatsit was ugly .  br    br   score  .      if i could   br    br   pros  br    br   they got the names right .  br    br   cons  br    br   it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation  script  acting and special effects  not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book . oh  and the main cover  poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle . some might say that this symbolizes high adventure . i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn  t even bother to photoshop meg  s arm on properly .  

=======================================================================================================

520 ===> this movie barely followed the story line of the movie . all of the fascinating points in the book didn  t even exist in the movie . they ended up turning it into a cheesy  tween  disney movie  crush  story between meg and calvin . it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part  or one of the likes . this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book . i can  t believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap  basic rendition . if you  ve ever read the book  i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of  lord of the rings  equivalence . this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time . poorly done .  

=======================================================================================================

521 ===> religious bigotry is rampant everywhere . australia is not immune to it .  br    br   a dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having  killed  her own baby . i don  t mean to spoil the story for you  but you need to know the basics before getting knee  deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison .  br    br   buy or rent the movie and discover how deep  seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe .  br    br   this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors .  br    br   both meryl streep  with her famous aussie accent  and sam neill  whose accent is his native  born pronunciation  are outstanding . those with supporting roles are also quite good .  br    br   you will remember this movie for many years .  br    br   see it   

=======================================================================================================

522 ===> this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based .  br    br   the right to be presumed  innocent until proven guilty  is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to fred schepisi  s partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial  it was not granted to lindy chamberlain  accused of killing her baby . the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely  a dingo was alleged to have taken it   but those implying her guilt even more so  and there was no solid evidence against her . but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt  and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media  and the media themselves  of course  were anything but innocent in this process  . so although cleared by an initial inquest  they were later prosecuted and convicted . although chamberlain was eventually released  this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence  proving  their innocence  something no defendants should have to produce .  br    br    a cry in the dark  is well acted throughout  especially by meryl streep  who puts on a convincing australian accent  at least to this pom  s ears  and manages keep lindy sympathetic  to us  while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure . the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking  because we believe in the characters as real .  br    br   regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story  something i can  t comment on   the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership  s least charitable instincts . no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away . i  m not a religious man  but the bible still contains some killer lines  if you  ll excuse the pun  .  judge not lest ye be judged  is one of them .  

=======================================================================================================

523 ===> i have never read the book  a wrinkle in time  . to be perfectly honesty  after seeing the movie  do i really want to  well  i shouldn  t be reviewing this movie i  ll start off with that . next i  ll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable . do you know why i say that  because i forgot what happens in it . i told you it was forgettable . to be perfectly honest  no tv movie will ever be better than  merlin  .  br    br   how do i describe a tv movie  i have never written a review for one before . well  i  ll just say that they usually have some celebrities . a wrinkle in time includes only one . alfre woodard  or woodward  i am not sure   the oscar winner .  br    br   the film has cheesy special effects  a mildly interesting plot  scenes that make you go  wtf  . the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go  wtf  . what did i expect  it  s a tv movie . they usually aren  t good . as is this one . a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster . to top it off  you  ll most likely forget about it the second it  s over . well  maybe not the second it  s over . but within a few minutes .  br    br   a wrinkle in time    

=======================================================================================================

524 ===> i was browsing through netflix and stumbled upon this movie . having fond memories of the book as a child  i decided to check this out . this is a movie that you should really pass on .  br    br   it is just not worth seeing . it is very boring and uninteresting . i feel that it would even be that way to small children . it has no magic that the book contains . this movie is not horrible  but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it .  br    br   there are moments that just come off as weird . the witch character is not very good . the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening . i know this is a kids movie  so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things  but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before .  br    br   the dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film  and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix . i really didn  t care how it finished . skip this film and read the book instead .  

=======================================================================================================

525 ===> fascinating movie  based on a true story  about an australian woman  lindy chamberlain  meryl streep  accused of killing her baby daughter . she insists that a dingo took her baby  but the story is highly suspicious . the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case  the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media  and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman  s conviction  based on barely any hard evidence . i love films that question the media  and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system . i  ve always thought that juries ought to be showed   angry men before they go through with their duties . it  s not  as has often been said  a liberal movie  but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge . a cry in the dark is likewise clinical . schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic . some may find the film boring or dry  but i found it engaging .  

=======================================================================================================

526 ===> in august     the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation . the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood . what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice .  br    br   michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock  central australia  that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area . no  one believed them . lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael as an accessory after the fact . the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing . the chamberlain  s trial was over before it began .  br    br   lindy never proved her innocence  so she was found guilty . there was never enough evidence to convict her  yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure . how could we as a nation even sit in judgement  from where we are  how could we possibly presume to know  unless there was absolute proof  and no reasonable doubt whatsoever  the chamberlains should have been acquitted .  br    br   fred schepisi  s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson  s novel  that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them . that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock .  br    br   schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation  hell bent on  the truth  being brought to light . he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay  his screenplay  co  written with robert caswell  vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred .  br    br   the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts . she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight . even her accent is almost  but not quite  spot on . a very good effort by the master of that trade . sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart  and he starts to question his christianity . his  as was streep  s  is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly . the entire support cast are also excellent  with some of australia  s finest actors and actresses playing a part .  br    br   technically the film is brilliant too  with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour  especially the rock  . editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged  while bruce smeaton provides a telling score .  br    br   for all aussies this is a must see  a shocking look in the mirror if you will  at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served  and the truth to be known . as michael chamberlain said   i don  t think anybody really understands what innocence means . . . . . to innocent people .   br    br   saturday  may         video  br    br   even on return viewings fred schepisi  s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains  who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in      is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving .  br    br   schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson  s novel to the screen  telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain  whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down .  br    br   amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact . what followed was little more than trial by media  and with the australian people determined she be put away  lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour  even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence .  br    br   meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence . she is truly awesome  and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent  though she does her level best to sound ocker . you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn  t cast in the role  but star power is probably the answer . alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill  outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes  while he feels powerless to do anything about it . a strong aussie cast lend compelling support .  br    br   editing from jill bilcock is very timely  ian baker  s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton  s music is perfect for the part . truly a must for all conscientious australians .  br    br   sunday  june         video

527 ===>   this may be a bit on the spoilerish side  i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie  nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed . that of course is the problem with taking  what many believe to be an amazing book  and turning it into a disney made  for  tv movie .  br    br   a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago . it  s got a great storyline that could hook children and adults . plus it  s got built in quality sequels . but disney  fying was not the way to go . the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book . it is a complicated and emotional story for kids . there was no reason to make charles wallace purely  psychic   because that was the easiest way of explaining it . there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs . w  s as added tension  there is enough tension in the story without that . there was no reason to remove meg  s glasses . . . that deprived us of what could  ve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book .  br    br   i could nitpick for days about little things  but i also think larger things  like the art direction was a off . take for instance the way they made camazotz look  with its strangely darkened skies . the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth . it looks like earth . it has people on it that look like humans . the skies are blue  the grass is green  and there are children playing . but something is a little bit off . the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie . the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth  that is if we forget how to love . it would  ve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they  re walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm .  br    br   i unfortunately did not watch the end . maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well .  br    br   overall an artistic disappointment .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

528 ===> i really didn  t like this movie because it didn  t really bring across the messages and ideas l  engle brought out in her novel . we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it  i  m afraid i can  t say the same for the film . there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn  t do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l  engle  this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating . don  t see this movie if you are a big fan of l  engle  s texts because you will be sorely disappointed . however  if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes  or educational as was my case  then it is an alright movie   

=======================================================================================================

529 ===> i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story . several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie . the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself . the cast just makes it that much more appealing . meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture . she nails mrs . chamberlain  s mannerisms  the accent  and even look . she shows the pain  hurt  surprise  and anger that lindy had to endure  and in the process it  s hard to remember that it isn  t lindy . in my opinion  this performance of meryl  s was better than her oscar  winning turn in  sophie  s choice   and should have garnered her her third oscar . sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain  and for some surprising reason  wasn  t recognized by the academy with at least a nomination . in all  this movie only receive one oscar nod  streep  s for best actress .  however  it did receive several australian oscars and nominations .  br    br   definitely a top  rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast .  

=======================================================================================================

530 ===> meryl streep is such a genius . well  at least as an actress . i know she  s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents  but she nails the accent every time . her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring . mrs . chamberlain  as portrayed here  was not particularly likable  nor all that smart . but that just makes streep  s work all the more remarkable . i think she is worth all   or so of her oscar nominations . about the film  well  there were a couple of interesting things . i don  t know much about australia  but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story . i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago  but it came through loud and clear yesterday . and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery  inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues . a pretty good film . a bit different . grade b  

=======================================================================================================

531 ===> the  wrinkle in time  book series is my favorite series from childhood . i have read and re  read them more times than i can count over the last    years . the characters  with all their virtues and flaws  are near and dear to my heart . this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful  magical  spiritual story that i love so much . to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement .  br    br   if you have never read the book  s  i imagine you will enjoy the movie . the acting is passable  the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie  and the story is interesting . however  if you love the books  avoid this movie at all costs .  br    br   i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel  in an interview with newsweek  l  engle said of the film   i expected it to be bad  and it is .    br    br   i  like another reviewer here  feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind .

532 ===> horrible acting  horrible cast and cheap props . would  ve been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie . what a waste . starting from the name of the movie .  br    br    the enemy  naming it  action movie  would  ve made it better .  contributing to the parody effect  . the cop looking like a   year old player  the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times . towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie . horrible . don  t waste your time .

533 ===> this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it  s impact on australian society . it especially looks at the problem of innuendo  gossip and expectation when dealing with real  life dramas .  br    br   one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations . not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis . just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so . this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings . it  s an issue that has to be constantly addressed .  br    br   the leads play the characters with depth  personality and sensitivity . and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based  on  fact individuals . some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors . it re  enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals .  br    br    spoiler warning    br    br   i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an ex  adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most . i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality  and emotional heart . i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers . it captured the themes of the story brilliantly .  br    br   i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to  play the best case for their character they could  . while this is especially apt for this story  i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well .  

=======================================================================================================

534 ===> once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they . . . somehow . . . managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended  you  ll find that it  s not half bad . the plot is engaging and interesting  and the pacing is fast  with this covering many situations  and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken . where this really stands out is the acting . the performances are excellent . neill and streep are both impeccable . it  s also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film  and even those who don  t come naturally to it at least attempt an accent . the cinematography and editing are nice enough  but they don  t really go beyond the standard stuff . this movie  s story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling . while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture  i understand that it is quite close to the truth . there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this . it is  at times  a downright great courtroom drama . i recommend this to any fellow fan of such .      

=======================================================================================================

535 ===> this abc straight  to  tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time . ms . madeleine l  engle brought children and adults alike into a magical  fantastical and original world like no author before her . this novel  the first in her  time quartet   is a beautiful take on life  the universe  and time itself . yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand . its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book . this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms . l  engle  s work of art . honestly  what were they thinking  the effects look cheap and ridiculous  the plot is mushy and uneven  the dialogue is far  fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost . this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen . i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent  worthy director  guillermo del toro  david yates  alfonso cuarn  makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece . this adaptation can only be compared to boring  fake and cheap motel  room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience .  

=======================================================================================================

536 ===> disney  what happened  i really wish the movie had been set in the    s like the book was . and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption . . . . . i  m glad that  maybe  someone might be influenced to read the books . . . . . but  the man with red eyes interchangeable as it  and what  s up with the volcanic upheaval  where was that in the book  peter jackson  save us     a long time ago       i heard that there was european version of this film . i sure wish i could id it . i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption . this movie needs to be x  d .  

=======================================================================================================

537 ===> spoilers following i picked up the book  evil angels  when it first came out knowing nothing of the case . just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here  i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain  s guilt . the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did . john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors  and picked up by the press  of the arterial spray  the actelone     plates  dr . james cameron  s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors  that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up  bloody hand print  etc . all quite convincingly . after all  these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie  and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn  t apparent to me at all . it was also highly technical evidence  difficult for a layman to understand . to this point  beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials  hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn  t believe it was possible . the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists  whose origins made them appear to be a cult  and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt . were it not for dedicated  selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony  finding azaria  s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail . the book shook me for that reason  and i  ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone  s guilt ever since  excepting oj of course  . i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don  t think it could have been done better . i  ve always liked sam  who i could identify with completely  and meryl was perfect as always . beautiful photography  haunting music . i think it  s not only a very good  but a very important  movie . too bad it didn  t receive more publicity at the time it was released .  

=======================================================================================================

538 ===> lindy  meryl streep  and her husband michael  sam neill  have just welcomed a baby girl  azaria . as seventh day adventists  they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church  with their two older boys looking on . michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer  s rock  one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia . not being wealthy  the family camps near the site . after a wonderful first day  lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents . suddenly  she hears azaria crying . as lindy rushes to the tent  a dingo dog is just exiting  shaking his head . the baby is gone and soon  so is the dingo . although the entire camp looks for the baby  she is not found . concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child  the chamberlains struggle to accept god  s decision and go on with their lives . but  unfortunately  the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby . she is subsequently arrested and put on trial . how could this happen  this is a great depiction of real events that shows how  mob rule  is not a figment of the imagination . the entire country turns against the chamberlains  in part because they are seen as odd . streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy  whose own strong  willed demeanor works against her every step of the way . neill  likewise  does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael . the cast is one of the largest ever  with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy  s case . the costumes  scenery  script  direction and production are all top of the line . if you have never seen or heard of this film  remedy that straight away . it is not a far cry from reality to say that this  cry  should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media .  

=======================================================================================================

539 ===> the book is so good that at least the opening of this made  for  tv movie will move you  but then  as it diverges more and more from the book  taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches  it becomes boring . still  from comments i  ve heard  people who have not read the book tend to like it  and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time  it will have served its purpose . the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins  uncle albert  i love to laugh  . nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny .  

=======================================================================================================

540 ===> awful . this thriller should have buried . what a piece of crap . terrible writing  characters are less than believable . horrible schlock   stick some b  stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit  but it fails miserably . if i didn  t have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review  it starts with  sh  and ends with  it  .  br    br   horrible ending  retarded . who writes this crap . the ending of this film is so contrived  weak it  s as if they had no idea what to do with this story line  or they just ran out of money . most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie . it  s a good thing that these actors are on the way out  because this would be a career killer . good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it . at least no one important  like future investors . it could have ended a thousand different ways  but as it is  i feel cheated out of my precious time .  br    br   don  t bother with this one  you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back .  

=======================================================================================================

541 ===> an unqualified    .  the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of  old  hollywood . sam neill and meryl streep are very good together . neill matches streep line for line  and take for take   it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best  notwithstanding the intensity of his role . this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama  portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms . the movie   which won several top awards in australia   boasts not only a superlative cast and director  but wonderful and authentic australian locales . it proves that people are the same the world over . and  after all these years  people still delight in repeating the famous streep line  accent and all  a dingo ate moy baby   including that imp  elaine benis  on  seinfeld .   

=======================================================================================================

542 ===> when i first saw  a cry in the dark   i had no idea what the plot was . but when i saw it  i was shocked at what it portrayed . when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class  i realized a second point communication issues . you see  when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain  s  meryl streep  baby  she and her husband michael  sam neill  were grief  stricken but didn  t show it . as seventh day adventists  they believed that god willed this to happen  and so they couldn  t mourn it . but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness  everyone started believing that lindy did it herself .  br    br   the point is  the wrong message got communicated to the public  and it turned people against lindy . even though this was a pure accident  it still happened . it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media  regardless of any media outlet  s political views .  br    br   as for the performances  streep does a very good job with an australian accent  no surprise there   and sam neill is equally great . you will probably get blown away just by what you see here . definitely one of fred schepisi  s best movies ever .  

=======================================================================================================

543 ===> this movie was poorly written  poorly acted and very predictable . it was very low  budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video . it wasn  t even campy fun  it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the      hours back  the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them .  br    br   the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing   what a stretch  skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre . just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this .  br    br   ejames      

=======================================================================================================

544 ===> this  movie  is such a bad work  nothing seems to even try and be realistic . plot is weak  acting  miserable  actors wondering around like in a  st year production  trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning . what a flop  what a waste of time  money and effort to all concerned including the audience . well  as in any thriller  here too are murders  corpses and blood . just imagine someone who  minutes ago  committed a murder with a knife  and came out calm and smiling  not to mention clean as a whistle  as if slashing one  s throat is done by a virtual agent . also  this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male  and she cut his throat    did she ask him  politely  to bend down for her  much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one . continuity is another huge problem as for instance the eager  hungry groom is lying in bed  waiting for his virgin  bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while  falls asleep      . next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception  area  asking for guidance to scenery spots  not a word about last night    such a waste of time even to try and write about this low  low supposed  to  be  movie  .  

=======================================================================================================

545 ===>   a cry in the dark  is a masterful piece of cinema  haunting  and incredibly though provoking . the true story of lindy chamberland  who  in      witnessed a horrific sight  seeing her   month  old baby being brutally taken from their family  s tent  while camping on the austrailian outback . azaria  the baby  was never seen again  and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world . meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy  as she always does . but the one thing that helps  a cry in the dark  never fall flat is the brilliant direction . a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case  tears are brought to the eyes . the concept is nothing less then terrifying  and afterwards you are left haunted  but also inspired .  

=======================================================================================================

546 ===> watch on the rhine is one of the best anti  nazi propaganda films made during world war two . paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar . bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was . i would recommend this film to those interested in that era  and  of course  the fabulous films of the late  great  ms . bette davis .  

=======================================================================================================

547 ===> ho  hum . an inventor  s  horst buchholz  deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands . unknowingly his son  luke perry  has been working on the antedote all along . enter cia agent olivia d  abo and the cat  and  mouse car chases and gunfire begins . also in the cast aretom conti  hendrick haese and an aging roger moore . moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts . perry fans will be accepting . d  abo is wrong for the role  but nice to look at .  

=======================================================================================================

548 ===> i regret every single second of the time i lost while watching this movie  really . unhappily  i always find it hard to switch off a movie once i started watching it . especially  when it  s such a classic or what people use to call a classic . i think that this is one of those movies every movie  lover should have watched at least one time  so that was why i watched it . don  t get me wrong  i like humphrey bogart and his wife lauren bacall both as a couple and as actors  but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion . no really good plot  neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story . well  not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres . only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether  bogey  and bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another . i think  to have and have not  is very overrated and bogart was in many better films during the     s .  

=======================================================================================================

549 ===> this is an extremely  powerful based  on  a  true story film that can be infuriating to watch . i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people  in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby .  br    br   meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good . let  s just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent .  she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts .   br    br   without giving anything away  all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally .  

=======================================================================================================

550 ===> roll is a wonderful little film . toby malone plays an   year old kid  very well acted  by the way  who is into soccer . malone  s cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags  a drug lord  some tough bikers  some cops  and some prostitutes . . . and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law  what the contents of either gym bag is  and even what gender a key biker is . parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels .  br    br   for me  roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll . those opinions are  . i really want to visit australia one day . the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation .  br    br    . some of the best filmmakers in the are australian . the cinematography in roll was especially impressive . i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes .  br    br    . australian women are hot   

=======================================================================================================

551 ===> i enjoyed the first reviewer  s comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second  run theatre in the early     s . i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings . but to me  the cast was largely squandered  their personalities muffled by the masks  while the direction i think of as being unusually static  and the photography murky . the rating jotted down at the time was a nought  which means  not worth sitting through even once  .  br    br   still  i too would jump at a chance to have a second look .  

=======================================================================================================

552 ===> this is one of those films that i could only sit through once . charlotte henry is fine   in fact  all the actors were fine . the problem was in the script  the dialog  the direction  the editing  the sets and the special effects . granted  this was      but it really creaked . part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen  gary cooper  w . c . fields and cary grant are not recognizable  there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming  . the movie just clumped along with no cohesion . much of lewis carrols spirit  humor and continuity are missing . what a pity  it  s such a great book . i would recommend disney  s     version .  

=======================================================================================================

553 ===> i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced   mins of roll .  br    br   roll is about a country boy  mat  toby malone  who has dreams of becoming a sports star . mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george  damien robertson  . well  that was the plan anyway . george is involved with a gangster  tiny  john batchelor  and is making a delivery for him . needless to say  mat gets dragged into george  s world .  br    br   i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little . toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job .  br    br   every character in the movie complimented each other very well  the two cops were great . david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie . tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters  pando  from two hands .  br    br   one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for   years  perth and fremantle . it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with  especially the old ferris wheel .  br    br   this rocks  n  rolls  

=======================================================================================================

554 ===> a country  boy aussie  rules player  mat  goes to the city the night before an all  important afl trial match  where he is to be picked up by his cousin . and then things go wrong .  br    br   his no  hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan  shark  drug  dealer tiny  who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian  . needless to say  mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos  and it isn  t long before thoughts of tomorrow  s match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night  s frantic events unravel .  br    br   accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country  boy mat  and successfully plays a part well below his age . best support comes from john batchelor as tiny  and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events . roll is fast  paced  often funny  and a very worthwhile use of an hour .  

=======================================================================================================

555 ===> this is a rotten movie . the cast seem to know just how bad it was . it starts badly and by the end is truly bad . the acting is woeful . the script could of been written on the spot . and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes . crap  out of    

=======================================================================================================

556 ===> i saw this film at a pre  release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills . as i recall  the film  s producers and director were in attendance  presumably to gage our reaction .  br    br   many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience  which would have been fine if it had been a comedy  but it was supposed to be a horror film .  br    br   if the audience wasn  t scared  it seems the filmmakers were . they delayed release for over a year . out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they  d re  cut it as far as i can tell  they hadn  t . it was the same lousy movie  just a year older .  br    br   it almost qualifies as  so bad  it  s good   but it  s slow  paced and boring .  

=======================================================================================================

557 ===> a film i expected very little from  and only watched to pass a quiet hour  but what an hour it turned out to be . roll is an excellent if none  too  serious little story of  country  boy  lost  in  the  big  city  makes  good   it is funny throughout  the characters are endearing and the pace is just right .  br    br   toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt  said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams . he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny . watch out for these two .  br    br   highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

558 ===> this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments . i loved the character of matt  and also tiny . they seemed the most engaging and funny characters  and certainly the most interesting . matt is very good  as is his no good cousin   and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy . i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor  eric bana . my personal favourite part was the brothel scene  loved that . overall  i liked the film and it  ll get about an  rating . the penalty however  i was disappointed in . it was a side foot curl  rather than the appropriate laces blast .  br    br   i am of course kidding .    

=======================================================================================================

559 ===> while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing  the execution is downright pathetic . i  m not even sure where to begin as i  ve got so many problems with this movie . i suppose i  ll just number a few of them  br    br    . the acting  when you see that edward albert  doug mcclure  and susan george  and her teeth  are the stars of your movie  you know you  re in trouble  not that it matters much to me  but these are hardly a  list names . susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy  but i  ve never considered her the greatest actress i  ve ever seen . and in this movie  her acting is embarrassing . as for the other two  the less said the better .  br    br    . the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride . at disney world . and  they are about as frightening . and why did they have to be so obvious  subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells .  br    br    . the plot  how predictable can one movie be  the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters . if you couldn  t see where this movie was headed after about   minutes  you need to see more movies .  br    br    . the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks  not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over  knocks on the door  and asks if you need help removing evil spirits . absurd is a word that comes to mind .  br    br    . everything else  it  s very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about . i suppose i  ll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house  s architecture . that  s a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn  t say much about the actual movie .  br    br   i  ll stop . you should be able to get the idea from what i  ve already mentioned . and  i haven  t even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems . be warned  this thing is horrible .  

=======================================================================================================

560 ===> film starts in     japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide . it  s a very gory  bloody sequence . then it jumps to present day . . . well     to be precise . ted  edward albert   wife laura  susan george  and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby  s work . they rent a house and   surprise  surprise   it just happens to be the house where the murders took place  the three dead people are around as ghosts  the makeup is hysterically bad  and make life hell for the family .  br    br   sounds ok   but it  s really hopeless . there  s a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between . there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious  they look so fake   i swear i saw the strings pulling one along   and they  re muttering      there  s a pointless sex sequence in the first   minutes  probably just to show off george  s body   another one about   minutes later  but that was necessary to the plot  and a really silly exorcism towards the end . the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed .  br    br   as for acting   albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend . but george   as always   is terrific in a lousy film . she gives this film a much needed lift   but can  t save it . i  m giving this a  just for her and the gory opening and closing . that aside  this is a very boring film .

561 ===>   a wrong  doer is often a man that has left something undone  not always he that has done something .    emperor marcus aurelius  br    br   the dvd release of  watch on the rhine  could not come at a better moment . it restores to us a major lillian hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by dashiell hammett  hellman scholar bernard f . dick  s audio commentary affirms his authorship  . it presents a subtle performance by bette davis  who took a subdued secondary role long after she  d become the workhorse queen at the warner bros . lot . equally significantly  it reminds us that world war ii had a purpose .  br    br   sure  you say  like we needed that . we  ve heard cary grant sermonizing in  destination tokyo        about japanese boys and their bushido knives . we  ve watched jackboots stomp the living hills in  the sound of music        . we  ve toured an england callously occupied by germany in  it happened here        . yet  truth to tell  we still need the message spread .  br    br   i have an    year  old friend who curses franklin roosevelt regularly . he feels that fdr connived the u . s . into a foreign fight we didn  t need  and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin . he  s encouraged in his demonizing of allied leaders and the trivializing of war two by patrick buchanan .  br    br   the political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that adolf hitler would have posed no further menace to poland  europe  or the world if only the third reich had been handed the free city of danzig in     . buchanan holds that if those selfish poles hadn  t confronted the nazis  drawing in foolishly meddling britain and giddily altruistic france  no war would have engulfed the west . he believes that without the rigors of total war  no one in germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the jewish problem .  br    br   some commenters on this site feel that  watch  sags under the weight of stale propaganda . maybe . however  neither my friend nor pat buchanan seem to have gotten the film  s point some people hurt and kill to grab other people  s land  goods  and liberty such people dominated the axis powers and  enough  didn  t appear in their vocabulary .  br    br   paul lukas deserved the oscar he won . he and bette davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors . they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines  for actively facing down torturers and murderers . bernard dick notes that hellman didn  t care for lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical . of course  as a hungarian he had seen first  hand bela kun  s bloody  dictatorship of the proletariat  replace an outmoded empire and then topple to admiral horthy  s right  wing tyranny .  br    br   in a marvelous cameo role added to the play by hammett  henry daniell sardonically depicts a wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves . his phili von ramme would doubtless stand with field marshal rommel in     during the plot of july   th against hitler . in april      however  he pragmatically abets the nazi cause  although he insults herr blecher  the butcher  and scorns the rumanian aristocrat teck de brancovis for trying to peddle information on an underground leader .  br    br   teck  a pauper and possible cuckold  wishes cash and a visa to return to europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire  shattering great war and the greater world  wide economic depression . he has no political convictions  no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow . mercury theater graduate george coulouris lends this burnt  out case  s old world cynicism an edge of desperate menace .  br    br   lucille watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man  s hostess  a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way   but who doesn  t adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls . she and her pallid office  bound son belong to the american version of von ramme  s and de brancovis  privileged kind . however  this family hasn  t seen ruin and never will . they  re moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it .  br    br   this mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward national socialism and fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit buchanan .  watch on the rhine  has a manicured period look . its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets . yet hellman and hammett  s film has gut  based power . audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march .

562 ===> in     i had just moved to the us from ceylon . i was    and had been married for a little over three years  and was beginning to come out as a lesbian . i saw this movie on an old black and white tv  with terrible reception  alone  and uninterrupted  in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story . i was living in a small house in tucson arizona  and it was summertime . . . like everyone else here  i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth  and its residue of fragile magic  and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday . i  ll keep checking in . i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel  s  the other side of venus  . it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy . . .  

=======================================================================================================

563 ===> i don  t think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it  s over if you were ever scared . this doesn  t really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn  t tack on one of those happy endings . story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto  japan so that ted fletcher  edward albert  can write a book and he brings along his wife laura  susan george  and their daughter amy  amy barrett  . their friend alex curtis  doug mcclure  who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted . about    years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide . their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher  s arrive it doesn  t take long before strange things start happening .  br    br   spoiler alert  br    br   at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher  s and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair . meanwhile  ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help . unfortunately the ghosts get ted  laura  and alex to play out their death scene like it happened    years earlier .  br    br   this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them . while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked . first  it doesn  t have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons . instead  it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts . secondly  it has susan george in the cast  i  ve always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch . also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn  t have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it  s one of the reasons why she was so popular . but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically . this isn  t a bad film but it  s never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two . the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career .

564 ===> dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a    year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred .  br    br   novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell . the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall .  br    br   one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned . the monk recounts the history of the house  which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence  and then the film simply cuts away to something else . earlier the monk had offered to help . well  where is the help  the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier   try to drive the spirits out of the house  although by this time it  s difficult for the viewers to care .  br    br   there are some  probably  unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts  i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director  s motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing  but on the whole this is a forgettable dud .  

=======================================================================================================

565 ===> as with all the other reviewers  this movie has been a constant in my mind after   years . i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story . i even wrote to the pbs station for more information . despite all this  all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the     s .  br    br   fastward to      after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was  a vhs copy of the movie . there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie . the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her . despite owning a copy  i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie . you can find it at http   www . johntopping . com  harvey   perr  war   widow  war  widow . html  

=======================================================================================================

566 ===> i saw this movie in      my first year of living in new york . i went on to live there for the next   years  but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie . it was part of a pbs series as i recall  and i  ve never forgotten it .  br    br   there are no sex scenes to speak of  just delicate  moving  extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement  all set within a conservative  boston  i think   world war  environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war  and did not seek out a career and financial independence . frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next   odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail .  br    br   there has to be a video of this movie  sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video   

=======================================================================================================

567 ===> this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don  t take it seriously . it is a bit dated and the effects are lame  but it is so enjoyable . there are giant crabs that attack a girl . oh  and the crabs sing japanese . it is amazingly bad . and the ending  which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome . predictable  but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat . don  t even give this film a chance and you will love it . susan george is fun to watch and yes  she does appear naked . her daughter isn  t quite worth putting up with  but she does get attacked by giant crabs . they are the size of large cats . this is a   but i love it . as a movie  my god  but for entertainment  i give it a  . did i mention there are giant crabs   

=======================================================================================================

568 ===>  . . it  s this one  very cool premise  right off the bat .  br    br   has an excellent first scene  gotta give credit where credit  s due .  br    br   has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever the ghosts appeared  which i really liked by the way how it was done  how it looked . . . the only thing was the ghost  s relationship . because of the way things went down in the first scene you  d think their dynamic would be different .  br    br   things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt  and the crab  spider scene was just not good . but then the ending is actually very good  sure   the grudge  basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai  s and that  s what i liked about this movie comparatively .  br    br   please  someone one with a tempered style remake this movie .  br    br   fans of  silent rage  would absolutely love this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

569 ===> it  s been a while since i  ve watched this movie  and the series  but now i  m refreshing my memory  this was a very funny movie based on the classic series  johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together . bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee . when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm  bo and luke sneak around hogg  s local construction site and find samples of coal . they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip  mine hazzard county  unless the dukes can stop him  with the help of their beautiful cousin  daisy . my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn  t right for the part of boss hogg  and sheriff rosco p . coltrane was way too serious . other than that  i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard     

=======================================================================================================

570 ===> what is wrong with you people  if you weren  t blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head . of course the film isn  t a masterpiece  i don  t think it was aiming to be . it was fun and funny  i never watched the show when i was younger  i only recently saw one episode  and when i watched the movie  i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere . the movie seats were practically shaking  and the car sequences were good because it didn  t bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in  fast  furious . and jessica simpson is plain hot  i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences . all in all  i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd . people  enjoy it for what it is .  

=======================================================================================================

571 ===> this could have been interesting  a japan  set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly  installed american family  but falls flat due to an over  simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director .  br    br   the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare  i . e . the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they  re expected to  besides  it doesn  t deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as  generally  the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way  such as susan george seducing diplomat  friend  of  the  family doug mcclure and edward albert force  feeding his daughter a bowl of soup   br    br   at one point  an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually  he  s called upon to exorcise the premises . however  history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure  possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors  engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death  at the end of the day  this emerges an innocuous time  waster  tolerable at just   minutes but  in no way  essential viewing .  

=======================================================================================================

572 ===> giant crabs cursing in japanese  what was in that drink  a terrible movie  but laughable . i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around . drink much beer before you see this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

573 ===> i  m a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show . and i really enjoyed this flick . i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters .  br    br   it  s funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like  lame plot  and  it  s much cruder than the show .  does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode  daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage . the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot .  br    br   and as far as the plot goes . it was the perfect dukes plot . in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen .  br    br   while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren  t exactly like their small screen versions  they do a great job and work very well together . i wasn  t too keen on burt  s boss hogg though . and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe . in the movie roscoe is a little . . . scary .  br    br   and who didn  t have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard   br    br   folks  allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia  bikinis and car chases  you won  t be sorry . it  s just a great dumb movie   

=======================================================================================================

574 ===> i saw this movie when i was a child . it blew me away . this was before the days of television  so a movie of this magnitude  could send a young kid into orbit . it so impressed me  that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days . the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its  time . sabu was a real delight  as was rex ingram as the genie . i found myself singing  i want to be a sailor  for months after the film left town . i would recommend this movie to any and everyone . i forgot to mention conrad veidt  who was as villainous a character as you  d ever want to meet . also  june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture . the color was outstanding . give this movie an aaa   

=======================================================================================================

575 ===> director kevin connor and wannabe action  hero  romantic lead doug mcclure  re  team in this ghost story set in japan . they had been moderately successful together in the      s  with the likes of  the land that time forgot          at the earth  s core        etc . without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though  the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way .  br    br   the film begins with a prologue set in the   th century  with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide . a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted  laura  visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place .  br    br   no surprises as to what happens next  with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex  mcclure  assuming the role of the wife  s lover .  br    br   everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant  to an inevitable  but surprisingly downbeat  conclusion . main points of interest are two feeble decapitations   the omen  has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set  piece   and the love  making scenes featuring the doe  eyed but extremely kinky susan george . the first is a long  don  t look now  inspired piece with her hubby  complete with piano music the second a much shorter  probably at her insistence  entanglement with mcclure  both looking pretty uncomfortable . anyway  every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost .  br    br   overall i can  t decide whether  the house where evil dwells  is rubbish  watchable rubbish  or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way . if you  re not into the genre there is nothing here at all  but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort .  br    br   best scene  in any other film the big  black  tree  climbing  japanese  muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show . they are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene  where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup . on seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is        to be told beef and vegetable  before uttering the immortal line  ugh  there  s an awful face in my soup  . if this wasn  t enough the reply is  c  mon  eat your soup for daddy .  laurel  hardy rest in piece .  

=======================================================================================================

576 ===> raising victor vargas is just a bad film . no amount of denial or ad  dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact .  br    br   maybe peter sollett saw he didn  t have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current  edgy film  making  . maybe he just doesn  t know any better . it  s hard to tell .  br    br   what  s not hard to tell is the result . except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film  making into an attempt at pseudo  realism  few will enjoy it .  br    br   i know i didn  t .  br    br   do yourselves a favor and pass on this film .  

=======================================================================================================

577 ===> next to  star wars  and  the wizard of oz   this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made . it  s a true shame it  s not as well  known as the former films  maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci  fi settings  and that it  s british  meaning a smaller market for films  but its wonderful to know that it  s deserved that reputation .  br    br   like all great family films  one can be a child  an adult  or even a teenager to enjoy this film  i  m currently     but one must appreciate classic films first . i absolutely adore this film . it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa  perhaps my favorite classic film score  that rivals any john williams  star wars  score  a fast but not flashy pace  beautiful sets  dialog  and use of color  both the sets and cinematography won oscars   and state  of  the  art oscar  winning special effects  for the time  and some are still stunning  . and  of course  june duprez  s sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta  jones   she even looks like jones in a way   .  br    br   in conclusion  this is one of my all  time favorite movie  next to  the adventures of robin hood   and it truly deserves more attention . it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout  and  along with  robin hood   it  s my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed .  br    br   stars   excellent   

=======================================================================================================

578 ===> it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages   to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful  colorful production  and  to adults  for a literate script  fine production values  good casting  acting  all bound together with a fine rozsa score . two roughly contemporary films accomplish this    thief of baghdad        and  the adventures of robin hood        . some of the back story on this production is fascinating . this production  commenced in england in the summer of      moved to hollywood  and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts  the producer  alexander korda  was subsequently knighted in     . here is a unique case of the intersection of art  commerce  and politics  by all means  secure a good cd of this film for your library   

=======================================================================================================

579 ===> i  ve seen the gator bait films  and this is almost exactly the same thing as those . a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them . the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones  although not very far  is that the sexual content is not glorified . there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film  but not for a second is it ever sexy . some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive  but that  s only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience  s need to see this woman seek revenge .  br    br   this is a weak film  it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers . i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral  but i was glad to see that  since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead  it was not meant to pass off as a ta film .  br    br   b  movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality  and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b  movie and contains more than its share of nudity  the nudity does not drive the plot . on the other hand  the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists . these men are evolutionary drop  outs just like they were in the gator bait films  and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them  but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b  movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind  but instead it simply satisfies the audience  s desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve .  br    br   the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks . oddly  the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity  although not by much   but it is by far the most painful to watch . we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible  it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller  staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord   but again  this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with .  br    br    spoilers  you know that this is all the movie means to do  since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed . the woman does not live happily ever after  she doesn  t write her book  she doesn  t leave and never return to that nightmare place  she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks . but hey  what more did you expect   br    br   oh  and did you read the tagline  if you decide to waste your time watching this  try and find any man getting broken or burned . i was really looking forward to those  

=======================================================================================================

580 ===> i  m not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there  s almost no plot  anyway . i  ve seen several reviewers call isoyg an  anti  rape  film or even a feminist statement  and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims .  br    br   first of all  what do we see on the cover of this movie  that  s right a shapely woman  s behind . whether it was zarchi  s attempt to make an anti  rape statement  and i absolutely don  t believe it was  is entirely beside the point . the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic  everything but actual penetration is shown  that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it .  br    br   the rape  s  in the film is uncomfortable  brutal and hard to watch . there  s something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light  but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly   minutes  none . there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed  mere moments before he  s murdered  so the scene isn  t at all engaging on an emotional level . really  it  s just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb  caligula  cannibal ferox  etc .  that it attracts only the exploitation crowd .  br    br   finally  a few reviewers have commended zarchi  s so  called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack . but considering how inept everything else in the film is  acting  script  etc .  i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn  caliber actors do their thing .  br    br   i  m not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg . i  m all for exploitation  horror and love video nasties . in fact  i  m giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films . however  it  s also poorly made and after the rape occurs  just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho  hum  mostly gore  less murders and wait for the credits to roll .  br    br   this is probably worth watching once if you  re a hardcore   s exploitation fan but i  m telling you  the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation .

581 ===> let  s cut a long story short . i loved every minute of it . a lavish fantasy in true arabian  nights style . there  s an evil magician  a pretty princess  a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after . modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic . only quibble the special effects are pretty dated  loved sabu with the djinn  s foot  though

582 ===> a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell . these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece  some of the most ravishing early technicolor  a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu  the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well . miles malleson who plays duprez father  the sultan of basra  also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose . don  t miss this one  since posting the above comments  i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i  d never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version  the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned  this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer . again  a must see

583 ===> with knightly and o  tool as the leads  this film had good possibilities  and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly  maybe some tension . but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants . it was of course totally superficial  beautiful english country and seaside or not . the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film  when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older  instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part . they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast  and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low  cost heartstring elements .

584 ===> quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom .  br    br   a group of top quality actors  in the main well cast  with a couple of notable exceptions   who give pretty good performances . penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana . all do well with the scripts they were given .  br    br   so much for the good . the average would include the sets . nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book  although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it . it is clear then that the dower house is far too big . in the later parts  the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk  presumably to save money  although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon .  br    br   now to the bad . the screenplay . this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it . edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives  blinded . he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide  why   loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer  s wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear  less emotional than brief encounter  . gus  a man besotted and passionately in love  is prepared to give up his love without complaint . walter  mudge in the book  turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man . jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won  t speak . aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification . the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers . whilst miss mortimer  s breasts are utterly delightful  i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward . the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson . the word limit prevents me from continuing the list .  br    br   there is a sequel  which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense  and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story . it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased .

585 ===> this was usually producer alexander korda  s advice on set to many of his underlings the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex  zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out  pushing it to six .  br    br   for john kobal  s     book   the top    movies   his survey of   film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach   th place . a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner  john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture  but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half  way mark .  br    br   the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie  s production shifted around england and america  eventually seeing completion in     and winning three technical oscars . like citizen kane  it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love .  br    br   the special effects  outstanding for the time  are still reasonable  and actually hold up if you squint . but it  s not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions . among them is an amusing horse  constructed out of a kit model  which  when a key is inserted up it  s rear end  begins to fly . there  s also a killer toy of the six  armed goddess kali   perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her  and a quite horrific  looking giant spider . also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet . but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as  in a superb moment of cinematic conceit  a djinn  genie  nearly a thousand feet tall  ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature  and adds an element of danger to the proceedings . and look out for the moment where he  s tricked back into his bottle   br    br   john justin does well as the arabic king who  for some strange reason  has an english accent and a stiff upper lip . sabu  the astonishingly muscled   year  old  is near  namesake abu  a likeably cocky thief . after they cross paths with the evil jaffer  conrad veidt   justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog . when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed  s  justin  s  perspective  we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues . in truth  the second half is someway the better  being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature .  br    br   three small songs pepper the piece  though as the film lasts for    minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient i wouldn  t classify this as a musical . it  s all great fun justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads  veidt is the boo  hiss villain  and abu is the youthful  irrepressible robber . it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of   s english movies  but once you  ve sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in . quite commendable .  

=======================================================================================================

586 ===> the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself  almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film . alexander korda nearly went broke making this film .  br    br   according to the citadel film series book about the great british films  adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as     and spent years of planning and preparation . but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle .  br    br   budget costs happen in us films too  only cecil b . demille always had a free hand at paramount after     when he returned there . but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film . part of the way through the shoot  korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon . he certainly wasn  t going to get scenery like that in the uk . korda also finished the interiors in hollywood  all in time for a release on christmas day     .  br    br   the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography  best artset direction for a color film  and best special effects . only miklos rosza  s original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category . korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it  s impossible to get bad color pictures from that place .  br    br   the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil . the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart  both belonging to duprez . this was veidt  s career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser .  br    br   of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source . beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star . literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features . sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant . not a bad message to be sending out in     at that .  br    br   the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today . it  s an eternal tale of love  romance  and adventure in any order you want to put it .

587 ===> simply not the quality i expected from morris  love brass eye and blue jam  . this is very much like a not so bad student film . what concerns me  in all this is why did it win a bafta    morris makes fun of  enshrined mediocrity   ayn rand  in much of his work  nathan barley  and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining   br    br   i just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle  the humanity of terrorism  four lions  that he isn  t going to cock that up  wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena .  

=======================================================================================================

588 ===> there  s nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets . it  s just that some are better than others . this is very poor . the acting is awful  the script dire and the special effects overrated .  br    br   why does hollywood treat it  s audience with such contempt  and why have they made a sequel   

=======================================================================================================

589 ===> this was a favorite of my childhood  i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time . now that i  m grown up and have a kid of my own  i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie . we watched it last friday  and he liked it . during abu  s fight with the giant spider  my son  s hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared .  is he gonna beat the spider  poppa   just watch  you  ll see . he has no historical frame of reference to speak of  eight years old   so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al  raschid might as well be oz under ozma .  br    br   i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring  do were perpetrated by the boy  thief  and not the grown  up king . in fact  if you deconstruct the film  s narrative a bit  the king is the thief  s sidekick  not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative  adventurous young boys .  br    br   it  s definitely a period piece  i suspect that by the time he  s eleven or twelve  my son will find it  corny  or whatever word the next generation will be using by then . the love story is barely one  dimensional  as a cynical friend commented   why does ahmad love the princess  because the narrative demands it .  the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy  repeatedly  for the clueless  love  struck deposed king is equally improbable . but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses  fifty  foot genies and the temple of the all  seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme . the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie  s climax is tremendous  as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his  stolen  magic carpet  seeking  some fun  and adventure at last    

=======================================================================================================

590 ===> i have seen this film several times  and watched it today  on tcm  solely because of geraldine fitzgerald . she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her  probably in  wuthering heights    or more years ago  . the real star in this movie  however  is paul lukas  and he deserved all the accolades he got . he makes it clear  whether we like it or not  that the end justifies the means . naziism had to be stopped  and anything that helped do it was good . he gave his children a line about being bad  and that they should not be bad  but as he said earlier when conversing with adults  he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation . lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation  and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do .  br    br   some people think his victim was a nazi  but i don  t think so  i think he was only after the money . his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him .  br    br   one interesting point in the film  and presumably also in the play  is the fact that muller  lucas  is a german . while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii  there was considerable anti  german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry . it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time  maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi  soviet pact   . after all  the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians . i think  however  that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later  after  watch on the rhine  was released .  br    br   the title is something of a play on words  as the  watch  is looking west  from germany . in fact  watch am rhein was a german army marching song  used in wwii  but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well . but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own  wach am rhein  .  br    br   all the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him . i am surprised he did not give his father  s secret away . in real life  he may very well have done so .  

=======================================================================================================

591 ===> this  film  is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seen .  br    br   please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction .  br    br   shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as  direction   which this film needed in droves . not that the writing was all the wonderful  rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way  the pseudo  documentary  style  prized by those who don  t know how to direct  .  br    br   this film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don  t know the first thing about film  making  which is most of them  .  br    br   just terrible . it says a lot about sundance and what it  s become that victor vargas was showcased there .  

=======================================================================================================

592 ===> without wishing to be a killjoy  brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichd films i  ve ever seen  this being one of them  and camp blood being another .  br    br   the acting is terrible  the print is shoddy  and everything about this film screams  seriously  you could do better yourself  . maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap   br    br   i bought this for    but remember  you can  t put a price on   minutes of your life . you  d do well to avoid this turkey  even at a bargain basement price .  

=======================================================================================================

593 ===> probably the finest fantasy film ever made . sumptuous colour  spectacular sets  incredible  spot  on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood . acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands  but here the poetic dialog is deftly  sensitively spoken  the humour is subtle and delightful as well  .  br    br   doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one . along with  the four feathers         one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films    and one of the finest motion pictures ever made .  br    br   a true  compelling classic   

=======================================================================================================

594 ===> words can hardly describe it  so i  ll be brief .  the thief of bagdad  was my favorite movie as a child  and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me . i loved this film from the first moment i saw it  when i was a boy of six who had started reading  the arabian nights .  i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu  s battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled .  br    br   rarely has so much beauty  magic  and wonder been captured on film . sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros  conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar  and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie . georges perinal  s photography is some of the best use of technicolor . one of the three credited directors is michael powell  a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films  including  a matter of life and death   aka  stairway to heaven   and  the red shoes .  he is one of the true masters of the camera  right up there with david lean  akira kurosawa  and orson welles .  br    br   as with all great works of art  the beauty of  the thief of bagdad  lies in the detail . every frame has its own magical charm . the story never lags  and the characters and their actions are always involving . here is a film that will never grow old .

595 ===> dear dear dear dear dear . . . me  i had the strength to see it through . . . but why    br    br   the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good . but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing . this was some kind of tremors for kids . i can  t believe this movie was made at all . . seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind  for kids  and they just did whatever they could with it .  br    br   what audience is this movie for  i can only think of      year olds . if you  re older than   you  ll have serious problems with this movie . it  s not only slow  but it  s so utterly boring . the characters are overacted  not just a little either  and so stereotyped it  s fun for a while . . but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen . you know everything that is going to happen too  cause yes . . . you  ve seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids . i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced . it  s so bad . . so wrong . . so . . . crap .  br    br   but ok  we did get a laugh now and then . not just at the silly plot holes  but some scenes where worth a replay or two . . . or one scene that is  where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys . . it  s really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly . still makes me grin when i think about it . but that only happened one more time sadly . . and that  s when the  badass  gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully . . . that and one comment  they spring from the ground like some demonic trout   at this point we where almost crying with laughter . but after that . . nothing could ever top that . .    . . so it  s pretty much downhill from there .  br    br   so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting . if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie . . . he  s either a  plant   vegetable or someone very evil . this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far . looking forward to seeing tremors   it  s bound to be box office hit compared to this . . . this . . . goosebumps no . . i  ll leave it at that .  

=======================================================================================================

596 ===> well . . . tremors i  the original started off in     and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch . however  they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii . trust me  those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one  i mean  ass blasters    now  only god himself is capable of answering the question  why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie   tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie  in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie  for it lives up to more than that . as i attempted to sit though it  i noticed that my eyes started to bleed  and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me . did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we  re from the wild west would make the movie  with the exact same occurrences  any better  honestly  i would never suggest buying this movie  i mean  there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well .  

=======================================================================================================

597 ===> this is an oriental fantasy about thousand and one arabian nights plenty of incredible adventures  fantasy witchery and wizardly . the malignant vizier jaffar  magnificently played by conrad veidt  with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince ahamad of bagdad  attractive john justin  who loses his throne  then he escapes thanks a little thief named abu  sympathetic sabu  . they arrive basora where ahamad and the princess  gorgeous june duprez  fall in love . but prince and thief are haunted by jaffar  ahamd is turned blind and abu is become a dog . the story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring  a flying mechanic horse  magic bow  flying carpet and of course the colossal genie  overacting performed by rex ingram  who gives three wishes to sabu  the magic eye  the figure of goddess kali with several hands  among others .  br    br   this remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time . produced by london fim  s alexander korda and directed by the definitively credited ludwing berger  michael powell and tim whelan with a stunning screenplay by lajos biro and miles malleson also dialogs writer and actor as sultan fond to mechanic games . the wwii outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting  then the three korda brothers and collaborators traveled usa continuing there the filming in especial on grand cannon colorado . the splendid visual and glimmer technicolor cinematography  setting and fx provoked the achieving three oscars  production design by william cameron menzies and vincent korda  cinematography by george perinal and special effects by osmond borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn  out . furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by miklos rozsa . this vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs  

=======================================================================================================

598 ===> despite having  different directors  this fantasy hangs together remarkably well .  br    br   it was filmed in england  nowhere near morocco  in studios and on a few beaches . at the outbreak of war  everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon .  br    br   notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song   i want to be a bandit  can  t you understand it  . it remains a favourite of many people .  

=======================================================================================================

599 ===> this  the direct  to  video death rattle of the tremors series  features sixty inspired seconds  sawblade you  ll know it when you see it  and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at . tremors  was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget . that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm  on  human violence  tops . the lackluster  cliche  spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors  experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long . only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through  much less enjoy this film . if you aren  t among them  don  t bother .  

=======================================================================================================

600 ===> the fourth  tremors  feature goes back in time  to the year     .  the legend begins  in the small city of  perfection   which was then  rejection  nevada  . as the story begins  seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly  graboids  . some of the characters in the present  day  tremors  films have ancestors  both figurative and literal  in the past . most obvious is the ever  returning michael gross  as hiram gummer  . unlike his descendant  mr . gross is inept with firearms so  he hires gunslinger billy drago  as  black hand  kelly  to shoot  em up some  dirt dragons  .  br    br   this one takes some getting used to  as it takes place in the distant past . it  s like a western with miniature versions of the original film  s monster  graboids  . these tamer  dirt dragons  are nowhere near as terrorizing as their  tremors        counterparts . consequently  in this film  the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground  which would not have happened in the original movie . and  it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly  when gross temporarily decides to leave town . why so helpless  why didn  t brent roam  as juan pedilla  immediately rally the people to fight without gross  disappointing .  br    br    tremors   the legend begins       s . s . wilson  michael gross  brent roam  billy drago

601 ===> abu  the thief of bagdad  helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer .  br    br   as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames  sir alexander korda  s london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights . replete with swords  sorcery  it gave audiences in     a short respite from the headlines . it also is a fine piece of film making  featuring good acting and an intelligent script .  br    br   conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it  playing the evil magician jaffar . his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days . here is a villain worth watching . as the boyish thief  sabu is perfectly cast in this  his third film . while not a hero in the typical sense of the word  his character is certainly heroic in deed  action .  br    br   the rest of the cast do fine work . john justin is both energetic  sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way sabu gets a significant part of the action  when he  s not transformed into a dog  but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must . lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra  coveted by two very different men . appearing late in the film  massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude .  br    br   allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller . miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra  forever dithering on about his mechanical toys  malleson was also responsible for the film  s screen play  dialogue  . aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend . mary morris  later an exceptional stage actress  plays the dual roles of jaffar  s accomplice and the six  armed silver dancer .  br    br   the film was begun in britain  but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california  which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast . the art direction  in vibrant technicolor  is most attractive  especially the fairy tale architecture in blues  whites  pinks .  br    br     br    br   born sabu dastagir in      sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore  s stables when he was discovered by korda  s company and set before the cameras . his first four films  elephant boy       the drum       the thief of bagdad       jungle book       were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed . after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career  but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films  black narcissus       being the one great exception . his final movie  walt disney  s a tiger walks       was an improvement  but it was too late . sabu had died of a heart attack in late      only   years of age .

602 ===> the story  line of  the thief of bagdad  is complex  owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together . the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points . the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas . he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar  s deeds and hate him . he is imprisoned by jaffar  where he meets abu the young thief . the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra . there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by . ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden . he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss . then he is captured . when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself  ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog . jaffar then asks for the princess  s hand  and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra . the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace  accompanied by abu as his dog . the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her . so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog  in hopes the prince can rouse her . he does awaken her . she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad  but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard . she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms  on his promise to restore ahmad  s sight and turn abu back into a thief . the princess sees a vision of ahmad he is in a boat jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island . abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle . abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel  then corks him in again . for freeing him  he gets three wishes . his first is for sausages . in the meanwhile  the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy  one of whose six arms stabs him to death . abu makes a second wish  to find ahmad . the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all  seeing eye . abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye  battling a giant spider  then scaling the goddess  s statue . abu gazes into the  eye  and sees ahmad in a canyon . he has the genie take him to ahmad . ahmad uses the eye to see the princess . she smells a flower and forgets everything at once . abu wishes they were in bagdad  but the genie laughs and leaves jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him  omitting mention of ahmad . ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess  but jaffar smashes the  eye  . abu finds himself in the  land of legend   where the old men who rule want to make him their king . he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead  to hurry to save ahmad and the princess . the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner  using his bow from the flying carpet  to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution . jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse  but another shot from the bow finishes him . ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess but when he tries to make abu his vizier  the young thief refuses  saying that what he wants is adventure  not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be . this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda . the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director  while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography . the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell  with tim whelan  alexander korda  william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating . the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong  oliver messel and marcel vertes . the production  apart from its gorgeous and expensive  looking visual splendors  i claim is dominated by two other elements  the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar . rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent  plus his usual intelligence and power . june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima  and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan . as ahmad  john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is memorably good in his winning role . this film has a spaciousness about it that is found  i assert  in other korda works also . its imaginative content stands in contrast to very  strong realistic sets  costumes and set  design elements . this is one of the most memorable idea  level fantasies of all time  worthy to be enjoyed over and over .

603 ===> i found tremors  the legend begins  to be dull and boring . all the action scenes were stupid . the so called  graboids  are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat  if not smaller . the acting was horrendous  and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga  because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed  the story is so dumb and useless . also  if you want to tell a story way back in time  make sure you use the same actor  michael gross   to be someone in the past  when he  s someone in the present in the other tremor movies . geez . . . if you haven  t seen this film  don  t waste your time . stick to tremors      and   for a good time . this film however  make sure you  re remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense .

604 ===> if fassbinder has made a worse film  i sure don  t want to see it  anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this  to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like  the bitter tears of petra von kant  . this film bogs down with so much arty  quasi  symbolic images it looks like a parody of an  art  film  . the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira  s prostitute friend channel  surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer  s endurance . but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex  wife and  or her daughter . these are the only moments that display any real human emotion  and prove that at the core of this horrible film  there was an excellent film struggling to free itself . what a waste .  

=======================================================================================================

605 ===>   the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful  but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad . the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with  but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her . jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog . this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa  restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess . during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds  a giant spider that  s really hungry  and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen .  br    br    this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses  genies  flying carpets  and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs . it doesn  t have any cheesy moments and the love story isn  t a waste of time . the production designs are just stunning in this movie . from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter . even though this movie is over   years old  the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today  s cinema . the music and songs are also well done . anyone who sees it will no doubt hail   i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas  as one of the great musical moments in movies . i  m usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i  ll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie .  br    br    what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don  t see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like  two towers  and  silent hill  . way before today  s modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place . one of my favorite shots in  two towers  is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates  the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor  and that  s what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie . they  re just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they  re all just fantasy beings .  br    br    it  s literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of  aladdin  got their inspiration . the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet . it  s not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it  s nice to know that i  m not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie . i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it  s amazing . that  s a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time . sure  the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the    s so give it a break . not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today  s standard .  br    br    if you ever wanted to see a live action version of  aladdin  then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won  t be their cup of tea .  

=======================================================================================================

606 ===> outstanding film of     with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened .  br    br   the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of     .  br    br   encounting treachery around them  lukas successfully deals with the situation . he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does .  br    br   davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn  like shedding of tears when they must part . resolute  she knows that her older son  must follow him on his path to liberty .  br    br   a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe .  

=======================================================================================================

607 ===> i can  t believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of   it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring  certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long  long time .  br    br   in a no  budget way  it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck .  br    br   this film should be avoided at all costs . it  s one of those  festival films  that only please the pseudo  intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it  different   therefore good .  br    br   bad film  making is not  different   it  s just bad film  making .  

=======================================================================================================

608 ===> this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues . that is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it .  br    br   i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin  elvira suicides at the end  but instead of this  in every scene somebody is trying to explain  when he was young  this happened . . .  and  he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there . . .   etc .  br    br   soon in the movie  erwin  elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute  certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat   and while telling her the story of elvira  s life  fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other . it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying . of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of  i have suffered much in my life  and am about to die  .  br    br   in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something  erwin  elvira encounters a former lover  that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys  as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality  is that he recognizes elvira .  br    br   there are some interesting shots and ideas  i must admit  such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin   but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder  s self  indulgence .  

=======================================================================================================

609 ===> an utterly beautiful film  one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do  in thief  s case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time . by the     s my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art  house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa  s stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again .  br    br   idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out  but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne . after escaping with a little thief played by sabu  ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures  although apparently not enough for sabu   and love not only conquers but annihilates everything . the special effects must have been mesmerising in      but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from   years later . anyway  if i  m requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies  flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects  favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall  s suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend  in fact  the stunning colours throughout sabu and rozsa  s triumphant but still wistful finale . conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever  this and casablanca  and then died . john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers  both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted  but the parts didn  t call for a huge range of emotions only pure love mattered .  br    br   there  s a couple of mildly violent images in it  but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a     positive message  it  s only a pity that nowadays little kids don  t watch this instead of the porn they prefer . one of my top   film favourites  i can  t recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time .  

=======================================================================================================

610 ===> the thief of bagdad is a treasure . first and foremost  it is a good story . though my four children  s primary exposure to this tale  the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights  comes from the disney corporation  the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end . the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability . sabu  who plays the young thief  abu  also measures up to any of today  s teen actors in appeal  judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say   he  s c  u  t  e    br    br   in      the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects . today  of course  those effects seem very dated   look  it  s barbie flying through the air   declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying  . yet they fit into the story well . the film is  after all  over   years old . the effects fit with the script . furthermore  what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state  of  the  art for the next twenty  five years . one need only compare the opening montage from a     star trek episode to see this . in that  it was quite an achievement .  br    br   this qualifies as a family film  though there are a few stabbings near the end . the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation .  br    br   all in all  a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment  or for the historical value of the effects . i recommend it .  

=======================================================================================================

611 ===> this film is in the mandingo  drum type  br    br   they were both dreadful but they are     better than this tripe   br    br   badly acted  made oliver reed is the main name  eartha kitt also is in it . tis a pity . rating is     about as low as yu can get  br    br   as always  br    br   jay harris  

=======================================================================================================

612 ===> there are no reasons to watch this movie . should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life  s every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill  like that would ever happen  then get this movie from the video shop  if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie . be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone  in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing  . oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk  go figure . but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie  claudia udy showing her chest  sadly no other reason than that   

=======================================================================================================

613 ===> i first discovered alexander korda  s       fantasy  the thief of bagdad in the early      s on a re  issue billed as  the wonder show of the century   both korda technicolor films  the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program . the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films . the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful  the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made . as the years passed  it became more difficult to enjoy the film  s color in the way it had originally been presented in . true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle      s . both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video . but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor . the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it   nice  but not as it should be . now comes the m  g  m dvd   dec      issue . the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning    it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once  i watched it a second time . the only  extras  are a spanish dubbed version  sub  titles in both english  spanish  and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer . thank you m  g  m for this exceptional dvd release . now  one can only hope that korda  s four feathers and a restored version of korda  s jungle book  to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation  will soon follow on dvd .  

=======================================================================================================

614 ===> three flash  backs introduce the main characters  abu  jaffar  and the princess  who will interact with ahmad three are the songs  each linked to those same characters . three times does ahmad pronounce the absolute word  time   in his declaration of love to the princess  answering her three questions at their first of three meetings . so strong is the impression he causes  that the princess will resist the three attempts by jaffar to conquer her  by three successive ploys deceit  hypnosis  and memory erasing . yet  jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman the whip  the power  and the sword . three is the number of flying entities the mechanical  horse  the genie  and the the genie and the magic carpet . the genie offers three wishes to abu at their first of three encounters three times does the genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges  and three are his considerations about human frailty  before he departs . abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn  armed guards  giant  spider  and giant  octopus  . three are the instruments of justice the magical eye that shows abu the future  the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save ahmad and the princess  and the bow  and  arrow to execute jaffar . there  s magic in the number three  and there is magic in this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

615 ===>   stars out of a possible    and that is being overly generous .  br    br   i thought with a cast of james woods  cathy bates  randy quaid  lou gossett  jr .  and henry thomas  how could it miss . i was wrong .  br    br   i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week  end he cranked out this piece of dribble . i  d long suspected sam s . of being kind of nuts  this film  based on his play  confirms it .  br    br   this is the kind of artsy b . s . that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote . however  for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash  there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie .  br    br   you haven  t seen dysfunctional families until you  ve seen this bunch . pa is crazy  ma is crazy  the son is crazy and the daughter is  oh yeah  crazy . they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush  especially the teenage daughter .  br    br   in addition to the above  as if that weren  t enough  the plot   and it  s so thin you could read thorough it   has a hole in it the size of alaska .  br    br   ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm . as it turns out so is pa . now i don  t claim to be a real estate expert  but the last time i checked  property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold . if only one of them owned the property  then the other could not legally sell it  so it would be pointless for that person to do so . mr . shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact  and therefore  his plot does not work .  br    br   not that anything else was really working anyway .  br    br   the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity  and i can  t imagine why anyone would want to .  

=======================================================================================================

616 ===> before seeing this movie  i would  ve said that i loved everything kathy bates has done . now it  s everything  minus  one . james woods is pathetic . . . not his character  his acting . someone should  ve told him that  poor  is not synonymous with dirty  nor ignorant  nor cliche . ditto for randy quaid  s stereotyping . the only redeeming feature is henry thomas  who isn  t a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess . if you enjoy the country  you  ll enjoy the scenery . that  s the best i can give it .  br    br   i  m a serious fan of both independent and quirky films  but this is simply terrible .

617 ===>   the thief of bagdad  is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar  conrad veidt  . he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad  and a gorgeous princess from her father . . .  br    br   he falls victim in the end  as all tyrants do  in books and legends  to love and of the common man whom he ignored  here embodied by the little thief  sabu  .  br    br   the armies of good and evil  black and white  are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms . . .  br    br   the script is poetic  simply and very beautiful . . . the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds  attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror . . .  br    br   the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes  and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues . . .  br    br   for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before  while through its use of color  it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before . . .  br    br   with flying carpet and flying white horse  with a giant genie  excellently played by rex ingram   with evil wizards  and with the good acting of sabu and veidt   the thief of bagdad  captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights . . .  br    br   the     version remains the screen  s finest fairy tale   

=======================================================================================================

618 ===> the story of the boy thief of bagdad  as it was once spelled  has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in      who starred douglas fairbanks in the first  silent  rendering of  thief of bagdad   to less imposing  more recent attempts . the best  however  remains      s version which for its time was a startling  magical panoply of top quality special effects . those effects still work their charm .  br    br   no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief  abu  john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch  ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier  jaffar  played by a sinister conrad veidt . the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram .  br    br   ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent  he and the boy  abu  suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates . ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt . their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work .  br    br   two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado  like black swirl lawrence w . butler and tom howard .  howard  incidentally  did the special effects for the     version of this film . both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry .   br    br   duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting . justin  s ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses . sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he  s very good . for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there  s a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind . still  i don  t think anyone under eight ought to see  thief of bagdad .   br    br   this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present . it was great to see computer  besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them .  br    br    thief of bagdad  is a pre  war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases . this is one of the best of its kind .  br    br       .  

=======================================================================================================

619 ===> this is not a children  s movie     br    br   this movie is like a  bad acid trip  for kids under the age of  . for a month my  year old from time  to  time would ask me  why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth  or  why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits   .  and that wasn  t the worst of it  . we stopped it about a    hour in but the damage had been done . intensely morbid  oppressive  violent . fortunately he  s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing . whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges . . . .  go ahead censure me  my conscience is clear .  .

620 ===> probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this  br    br    . they might not have read the book .  . they might enjoy gore and violence in a film .  . they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence .  . people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book .  . there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here .  br    br   the only thing i liked about this film is the song   bright eyes  .  br    br   if perchance  you happen to be one of those people who has read the book  enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence  you are sure not to like this . otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this .  br    br   like in the book  a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come . only a few rabbits  including his brother hazel  believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live . . .

621 ===> watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non  aggression pact signed in august of     . so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line  the line didn  t change until a couple of months later . lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work .  br    br   the play watch on the rhine ran from april     to february     for    performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler  eric roberts as the youngest son  lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas .  br    br   lukas pulled an award hat trick in     winning an oscar  a golden globe  and the new york film critics for best actor . probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well . the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against  humphrey bogart for casablanca  gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls  mickey rooney in the human comedy  and walter pidgeon for madame curie . every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was . lukas  s nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field .  br    br   jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas  s wife was given to bette davis . davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her  but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it . it  s the same reason she did the man who came to dinner  a much lighter play than this one .  br    br   davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days . after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe  davis lukas  and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war . they  re made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren .  br    br   the fly in this ointment are some other house guests  a friend of davis  s from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe  a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris . coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas  s anti  fascist background .  br    br   his suspicions are quite correct  it  s the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they  ve become . lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there . his health has not been the same since . his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes . those decisions affect all the other members of the cast .  br    br   adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman  s significant other . coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell  kurt katch  clyde fillmore  erwin kalser and rudolph anders .  br    br   coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count . he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad .  br    br   lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in      but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls . dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti  fascist classic  casablanca .  br    br   though it  s an item firmly planted in those specific times  watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti  fascist message that bears repeating infinitely .

622 ===> the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza . he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer  paired with dorothy kirsten  soprano of the metropolitan opera . indeed  i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso  check a  vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini  . the mgm art and music departments also did a good job . this movie could be perfect  were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best  dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before      unforgivable . lanza deserved a better leading lady  and blyth should stick to less demanding productions . also notice that ms . kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza  giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano .

623 ===> ok  i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a  classic  and a standard part of most people  s childhood  but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of    i must admit i really hated it .  br    br   we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it  and many people who whimpered at the very words  watership down   their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams  recommended it . to be honest  i wish i hadn  t bothered . i gave it the benefit of the doubt generally i don  t like to stop watching a film half way through . this was an exception . it was really  really  excruciatingly  sickeningly dull . this film was possibly the slowest thing i  ve ever watched  imagine a doped  up snail in space   and really didn  t  do it  for me . the art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee  yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced .  br    br   i  m not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area . generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment  it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across . for me  i kind of wished that they would get gassed  not because i  m a horrible sadistic person  but because the characters were uninspiring  annoying  dull and generally quite rude  oh i  m so terribly english  . i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film  and it took a whole   minutes or so before anything actually happened  and even that was a terrible anticlimax .  br    br   if i were to praise it in any way  i  d have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well  meaning . maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy  but the message it  s trying to put forth is good in its nature . the musical score was not bad  too .  br    br   so  to conclude  this film is pretty poor . i couldn  t watch it the whole way through  or i  d probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom . granted  it isn  t  torque  bad  but it still doesn  t rate highly in my eyes  so i  ve given it a     .  br    br   hope this helps .

624 ===> i saw this movie as a very young girl  i  m   now  and it scared me witless for years . i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to  obviously  the violence . my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie . i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it    i am currently reading the book  out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it  s a classic  and it is really a great story . however i don  t think that it should have been made into a cartoon . ever . well  maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way . gives me a little heart palpitation every time . yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids  read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content . not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there

625 ===> mario lanza  of course  is  the great caruso  in this     film also starring ann blyth  dorothy kirsten  eduard franz and ludwig donath . this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary  world  renowned tenor whose name is known even today .  br    br   the film is opulently produced  and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza  kirsten  judmila novotna  blanche thebom  and other opera stars who appeared in the film . if you  re a purist  seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from  lucia  will strike you as odd  even if caruso  s wife dorothy just had a baby girl . also it  s highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia the role lay too high for him .  br    br   in taking dramatic license  the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso  s life . what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire  yet this is never mentioned in the film . these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in  girl of the golden west   there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga . the reason for that photo  his only shirt was in the laundry . he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking  machine company  later rca victor  . he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake .  br    br   instead  the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha  which never happened . he had a hemorrhage during  l  elisir d  amore  at the met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the met  his last role as eleazar in la juive . what killed him  the same thing that killed valentino  peritonitis . his first role at the met was not radames in aida  as indicated in the film  but the duke in rigoletto . so when it says on the screen  suggested by dorothy caruso  s biography of her husband   that  s what it was  suggested . what is true is that dorothy  s father disowned her after her marriage  and left her   of his massive estate . they also did have a daughter gloria together  who died at the age of   on           . however  caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy .  br    br   some people say that lanza  s voice is remarkably like caruso  s  but just listen to caruso sing in the film  match point    caruso  s voice is remarkably unlike lanza  s . in fact  from his sound  had he wanted to  caruso could have sung as a baritone . he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes  further evidence of baritone leanings and the role he was preparing when he died was othello  a dramatic tenor role  which lanza definitely was not . lanza  s voice deserved not to be compared with another . he made a unique contribution to film history  popularizing operatic music . he sings the music in  the great caruso  with a robust energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career . his acting is natural and genuine . ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself .  br    br   really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans  which are probably one and the same .  

=======================================================================================================

626 ===> yes  be my love was mario lanza  s skyrocket to fame and still is popular today . his voice was strong and steady  so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso . lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso . having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza  he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza . there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story  but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood  i used to practise singing his songs years ago  and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema  asthma ten years ago . reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful   

=======================================================================================================

627 ===> so . . . it  s really sexist  and classist  and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie  like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change . well  he certainly changed his tune  and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit . what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers . the end of the movie does not make her a hero  it makes the whole thing sad . and its sad that people think it makes her a hero . perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away . positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience . yuck .  

=======================================================================================================

628 ===> i should love this movie . the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me . the movie makes working class people look low and cheap . the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy . barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family . i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it . again the acting was very very good and worth watching . i really don  t like the story line . just a personal preference . thank you  

=======================================================================================================

629 ===> the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in     and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most  movergoers  were stay  at  homes watching their new   motorola televisions . almost all recent box office figures are false    because they fail to adjust inflation . obviously today  s    movies will dominate . in     it cost   c to   .   at radio city   c to   c first run at loew  s palace in washington dc  or   c to   c in neighborhood runs . what counts is the number of people responding to the picture  not unadjusted box office  media spin .  the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso  really not a great story anyway  and threw it in the trash . instead     of the movie  s focus was on the music . thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best  ever historic opera singer enrico caruso . the result was a wonderful movie . too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating . too fat to play the student prince  edmund purdom took his place    with lanza  s voice dubbed in  and with the formerly handsome and not  fat lanza pictured in the advertising . if you want to see the great caruso  it  s almost always on ebay for   .   or less . don  t be put off by the low price  as it reflects only the easy availability of copies  not the quality of the movie .  

=======================================================================================================

630 ===> i like it because of my recent personal experience . especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite . the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their  real  lives  but they did enjoy themselves  i . e . what they were . the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory . a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city  but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life . many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those . before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way  which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film . before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head . it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities . this made the conversations between the characters interesting  not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas . you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story . the end was not quite important after all . you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie . movies are supposed to be enjoyable . this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it . i am on a journey too . the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions .  

=======================================================================================================

631 ===> i hate this movie . it is a horrid movie . sean young  s character is completely unsympathetic . her performance is wooden at best . the storyline is completely predictable  and completely uninteresting . i would never recommend this film to anyone . it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see .  

=======================================================================================================

632 ===> well  they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied . i don  t know if stella james  sean young  qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac  but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men . she  s still exploring  trying to find  more data  so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it  though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now .  i can  t agree  however  with anyone who says young is too old for the role . if she is  we should all age so nicely .  for the most part this film left me cold  though it  s by no means the worst of its type you  ll ever see . and unlike the recent  eyes wide shut   at least something happens in this one .  

=======================================================================================================

633 ===> amazing movie that  in theory  should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding . instead of relying on clichs and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments . the lead characters are not perfect  and so relating to them as people you could know is easy . the movie is not trying to pull laughs  or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance .  br    br   i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel . a moving  thought provoking  funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany  s . will soften even the hardiest heart .  

=======================================================================================================

634 ===> i  m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good . i was stunned . easily the most romantic thing i  ve ever seen in my life . stunning . brilliant  sweet  funny and full of heart . the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing .  br    br   ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they  re a couple .  br    br   the movies grabs you right away and doesn  t let go . you can  t look away nor can you stop listening to them . even the little moments just melt your heart .  br    br   this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever . a masterpiece .  

=======================================================================================================

635 ===> the first half was ok  but the last half really  really disappointed . it  s funny the producers even admitted they didn  t have a clue for the ending  and it really showed . whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this . i really didn  t want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn  t really worth that effort . when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake  it didn  t happen that first season border on being space porn . they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama  so i started watching again . but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel  same with baltar and six was pretty dumb .  

=======================================================================================================

636 ===> first of all  write the script on a napkin . who needs more than that  after all we  re not a hollywood film .  br    br   then get amateur actors . it will be good for the festival hype . after all  who needs people who have spent years honing their craft  then  hire a cinematographer who doesn  t know how to light . you see  if it  s well  lit  it won  t look  real  and the festival people won  t like it . who needs to have professional level photography anyway  then hire a ten  year old who has never held a camera to be your operator . it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for  reality  and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people  critics and a small sliver of the audience who over  intellectualize will scream  genius  because they won  t believe this was just complete amateur  hour .  br    br   once you  ve done that  buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance .  br    br   what a sad waste .  

=======================================================================================================

637 ===> i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago . having saw it twice  i couldn  t help but missing before sunrise  not because the sequel was not as great  but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did  every time i finished watching one of them  i feel the need and yearning to see the other . so  i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly  i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly . the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other . it sounds so simple  the growing of the chemistry  i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development  but to me  who doesn  t believe in nora ephron  before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it . when i saw it for the first time  about  year ago when i was    i already liked it . but  i didn  t rate it as a  great film   it still seemed to me like another thinking persons  feel good movie  linklater was too smart to make it more realistic  it was   minutes too long  the characters was too well fabricated  i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations  etc . etc . . but now  thanks to before sunset  i feel that  s more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before . i saw the elements more clearly jesse  celine  vienna  their conversations  everything . how each of them are separated element by itself  and they have a chance to mix  the story is just a frame of time  i am no longer feel manipulated . and the freedom that every scene has  as well as its refusal to be overly efficient  how blind i was that those qualities didn  t strike me as exceptional when i first saw it  now   year have passed  the more movies i  ve seen  the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending  even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters  s own slackers included . the jesse and celine tale avoid that  maybe before sunset is a better example in this case  but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time  not a destination  every single scene has its own life . i don  t know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise  but to me  one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other . before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes  seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine  the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it . meanwhile  i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset  and celine  s first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i  ve seen in a beginning of a film  and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don  t know with a sadness in me  no matter how beautiful paris is  and no matter how happy i am that they meet again . i  m sorry that i go on this long with my limited english  before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts  and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it .  

=======================================================================================================

638 ===> i  m not even sure what to say about this film . it  s one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic . to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa  like dancing about architecture  . it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again . this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write . the ending is left open and ambiguous  no happy ending here  just mystery . no profound life lessons  just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings . . . . . . romantic love .  br    br     out of   watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

639 ===> i loved the first season . the quality went down a little bit in the second season  which however had a great middle  pegasus   . third season was fairly novel and original and was ok . fourth season started going downhill fast  because they never even began giving us any explanations  when by now we were really starting to need them . what the hell was the cylon plan  why were there two cylon factions  what was the point of angel  kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth    what kind of a past did the last five cylons have  and how did they survive  or were they reincarnations  questions everywhere  answers nowhere .  br    br   and then comes the end . earth    our earth  in the past . well  okay . but destroying the fleet   giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life  and spreading a few thousand people paper  thinly across the planet   that  s not only anti  science  it  s anti  reason and anti  life . and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a . i . that ruins everything . it is without vision  without hope for a grander future for humanity  and it is antithetical to proper science fiction . and don  t even get me started on the angels  religious claptrap of the worst kind  the ultimate disappointment    br    br   the whole  all this has happened before and will happen again  thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series  not just to earth as we know it . making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius . frakkin shame .  br    br    out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

640 ===> horrible ending  and i can  t believe moore spent a year coming up with it . smacks of l . ron hubbard and dianetitcs  which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks . this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first  .  years . now  the first  .  hours were action packed  though absurd in the premise  and then it deteriorated into a slow  painful  sophomoric dissolution of the series . unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was . were we to think more deeply  if i wanted a lesson in a  materialism  i would reread daniel quinn  s ishmael . absurd to think   k people would give up everything for a  fresh start  . absurd to throw in a disappearing kara  and a reappearing baltar and six . absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve . just absurd .  

=======================================================================================================

641 ===> american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa . on the train he met a french girl celine . although they met the first time  they talked like good friends . when the train stopped at vienna  jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna . then the romantic story unfolded .  br    br   at first they were cautious . the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store . they peeked at each other  though their eyes did not contact . after in  depth conversation  they relationship became close . then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend . their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words .  br    br   love is a strange thing . when you really want it  it will not come as you wished . love needs mutual understanding . without it  love will not last long . spiritual harmony is the most important for love .  br    br   excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie .  br    br   one of the best romance movies .      

=======================================================================================================

642 ===> the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people . presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart . a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions . the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation . the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed . ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch . a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love . by far the most romantic  at least one of them  movie of all times .  

=======================================================================================================

643 ===> did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak     god was behind everything  what has god got to do with sci  fi  god is only the answer when you can  t think up a sensible explanation for something . in fact  this is exactly the problem with the series finale  they obviously couldn  t think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper  how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth   why baltar has an imaginary  in his head  why  has an imaginary baltar in her head  etc . so they explain it with  angels  or just don  t explain it at all .  br    br   the plot of the last  episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through . for example  why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl  hera   particularly after adama said there was no way he  d attempt a rescue  because they found out the location of the cylon base  that  s not a good reason to sacrifice the crew  s lives . and how did anders know the location  and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters  lives before the war  it  s like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment .  br    br   the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series . feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread  the word  . forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot  the important message the writers wanted to get across is don  t put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation  tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment  .  br    br   imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no  force  . . . instead  a jedi actually gets his power from jesus . then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks . would this be a good ending  no it frakken  wouldn  t .  

=======================================================================================================

644 ===> with these people faking so many shots  using old footage  and gassing animals to get them out  not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors  what  s to believe  old film of countries is nice  but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films . i know  racism is ok in these old films  but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility . portrayed as fliers  they never flew their planes  martin johnson was an ex  vaudevillian  used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties  denying his wife  s apparent depression  using her as a cute prop  all this makes these films unbearable . they were by no means the first to travel to these lands  or the first to write about them . he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer  but that  s about it .

645 ===> i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of  before sunrise        and  before sunset         and saw both films in a row  without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately . after sleeping it over  i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter  and i shall explain why .  br    br   before sunrise introduces us with then young actors  ethan hawke  reality bites  dead poets society   only   at the time of the film  s release and julie delpy  the three colors trilogy   then    although looking much younger  . he is a promiscuous american writer  touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend she is a young french student  on her way home to paris . they meet on the budapest  vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together . the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna  exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love .  br    br   the film has      s written all over it back then  technology was leaping rapidly  the new millennium with all it  s hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner  and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future . the characters of jesse  hawke  and celine  delpy   with all their flaws and inconsistencies  celine  s accent  if by mistake or on purpose  was half american  half french  and it swinged from one spectrum to the other  breaking the character  s credibility   were a mirror of the time . watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement  acting all clichd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well  is what really made this movie work for me . the fact that the director doesn  t let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while .  br    br   all in all  sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna  a well told classical romantic rendezvous  and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future .

646 ===> this is a slow moving story . no action . no crazy suspense . no abrupt surprises . if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking  about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey  dovey romance  don  t waste your time and money .  br    br   on the other hand  if you  re into dialog  masterful story telling  thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie . i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert  though  because the pace  the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood . it  s truly fantastic . i really mean that .  br    br   ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but  thankfully  the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural  warm and tender . they act and feel each other out from the very beginning  making you feel as an intruder .  br    br   in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner . i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence . still it did not ruin the movie .  br    br   the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it  s charm and ultimately it  s power .  br    br   bottom line the movie  s flow is slow . the dialog is fascinating . the story builds gently  systematically and substantive . the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding .  

=======================================================================================================

647 ===> admirably odd  though mean  spirited comedy  drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome . robert altman  directed quasi  comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight . some of the cinematography is evocative  shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide  and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud cort  s vision of a  mother bird   imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her   . in the lead  bud cort is   once again  after  harold  maude    a true original not off  putting like  say  michael j . pollard  cort manages to be geeky  wacky and inoffensive  a tough act to pull off . unfortunately  this is one of altman  s misfires . he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else  but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward .  from   

=======================================================================================================

648 ===> the movie sucked  it wasn  t funny  it wasn  t exciting . they tried to make it so bad that it would be good  but failed . and thinking it  s cool to like this movie  next to the hype  are the only reasons that this movie is a success . . .  br    br   the fact that at this moment    voted a   out of   for this movie seems pretty concerning to me  either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes  and should be dealt with . anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising . it  s success can only be described as a marketing marvel .  

=======================================================================================================

649 ===> when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in     via a free advanced screening  i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it . i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended . i  on the other hand  felt completely the opposite . i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else . people i talked to said there was too much talking  plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters . i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie  going public seems to have a tendency to want easy  to  follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused . they also like to be spoon  fed tidy endings   happy or sad . this disgusts me . nobody wants to be challenged anymore    and as for the ending  and i don  t want to be a spoiler   i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again . it  s all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny . it  s a very personal film that doesn  t speak to all people . but it certainly spoke to me . give it a chance  be patient with it  richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna . watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters . as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass . it  s very intimate . plus  ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life . they must have improvised during some parts and it works well . they have a great chemistry in their roles . their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses . i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr . linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made . it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much . bravo for romance

650 ===> ever since i can remember and i  m only   my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run  but hey don  t get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the   s and   s  anyways  now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv . of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson . but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed . the children . . . did not act like children in the slightest . but there is good reason for that  having had to hid and run most of your life  seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence . so people saying  oooo i hated how the kids acted . . . blah blah blah  read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see .  br    br   paul lukas . . . dear paul did an amazing job    now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn  t but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way . but lukas  performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears . i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone     d  

=======================================================================================================

651 ===> what a bad  bad film    i can  t believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious  amateurish excuse for a real movie   i left the theater before the end  stunned by how bad the direction and camera  work of that movie were   and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry .  br    br   at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film  making than anything else .  br    br   avoid at all costs . you  ll want your time back  i know i did .  

=======================================================================================================

652 ===> unless you are between the ages of   and    except for the r rating   there are very few things to like here . one or two lines from kenan thompson  david koechner  we really should see him more  and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings  but sadly  that  s it . poor plot . poor acting . worse writing and delivery . the special effects are dismal . as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke  the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible . if we consider the action portions  well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan . this movie only contains the latter kind . this leaves little left . i  m so glad i did not pay for this .  br    br   despite any hype  i can read and think  so as i sat down to watch  i did not expect anything good . i had no expectations  but was somewhat worried going in . yet  like a train wreck  one cannot merely look away . and even with no expectations  i was let down . bad . not even  so bad  it  s good  material . i  m  very  tolerant of bad movies  but this makes  six string samurai   which i liked  oscar worthy .  br    br   no  this piece of over cgi  d rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth  little man and gigli . how this is currently rated a  .  completely mystifies me . brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers .  br    br   i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight  i witnessed a train wreck . i need to go wash my eyes .  of    

=======================================================================================================

653 ===> before sunrise has many remarkable things going on  almost too many to fit into one review like this  but it  s suffice to say that it  s one of the most observant character studies of the nineties  maybe even in all of contemporary cinema  to be observant not about love  per  say  so much as it  s about a human connection . how does one fall in love at first sight  no one does  at least that  s deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film . and yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection  of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time . linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie  a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna  and on the way there start to talking about things  at first arbitrary  then personal  jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather  . jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the  town   in vienna  until his plane the next morning .  br    br   before sunrise gives jessie and celine  in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance  and in a sense is about the act of having conversations  of what it  s like to watch people having one leading into another and another . here it  s often about relationships and commitments  as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential  or seemingly so  and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities . we hear confessions of desires for other loves  or what weren  t really loves  of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you  ll love your life  of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form  or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul  i loved the bit about the quakers in the church   and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism . jessie may be more responsible for that last part  but what  s fascinating about the film is that it  s never exactly cynical itself  just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives .  br    br   meanwhile  it  s always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles  where they  re not incessantly annoying in that   s generation  x mode  but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film  which isn  t a bad one at all but a necessary one  one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere . the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter  only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other  where sweet asides are actually acceptable   i have to tell you a secret   jessie says  and then leans in for a kiss  ho  ho   or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way . i loved the scene with the poet  where it  s very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal  or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share  but really are seeing them do it first  hand . all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly  we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives  as it may lead off into the future . . .  br    br   featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness  however self  contained  as it may lead into something more . who  s to say you can  t suddenly be attached to someone  if only for less than   hours  and be that much more attached than a married couple  this is perhaps linklater  s thesis  but there  s more to it than just that . it  s a very dense film  and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly . one scene especially  which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking  on the phone  in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other  s friend . a  

=======================================================================================================

654 ===> this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i  ve ever seen . closely followed by none other than  before sunset   which technically isn  t another movie at all  since it  s about the same two people and the same romance .  br    br   this is  love  in the real world . ok  that  s only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie . reading the other reviews  it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog  based movies as well . and this is what makes  before sunrise  so good . the dialog is perfect . it  s so real  so engaging and funny . it  s hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love   coz you fall in love with them at the very same time .  br    br   my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop  where they pretend to phone their best friends  with the other pretending to be said best friend . it  s perfect . brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life .  br    br   i must say that if you have a choice  do watch  before sunrise  before watching  before sunset  . if like me  you watched  sunset  first  it  s hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show .  br    br   once again  the greatest romantic movie in my books . wonderful acting  excellent script  and beautiful locations . young love  at it  s best .  

=======================================================================================================

655 ===> all internet buzz aside  this movie was god awful . i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything . instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller  horror movie  and they completely missed . there were only a few good parts  and a couple good lines by samuel jackson . other than that  it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes . all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie . now that the movie has actually come out  hopefully this joke will die . don  t waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash . if you  re looking for something that  s funny and entertaining  then just go to snakes on a blog .  

=======================================================================================================

656 ===> i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i  along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience  were vastly disappointed . the movie wasn  t even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake  bite victim . samual l . jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame . it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies  except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy . it all seemed worn  flat  and overtly formulaic . i  m shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun . it  s easy to understand that soap realizes it  s a piece of sit and plays along with it  but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense . it  s the worst kind of lame movie it  s joyless .  

=======================================================================================================

657 ===> sweet and charming  funny and poignant  plot less but meaningful   before sunrise         the third movie of richard linklater  is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love  is in love  or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it . it is one of the very rare movies that is  should  will be equally interesting to teenagers  their parents and even grandparents . it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects  car chases  or long and steamy sex scenes . two young people in their early   s  two college students  american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne  meet on a train . they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking  they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night . they talk and fall in love . that  s it  that  s the movie . it could  ve been boring and silly but instead  it is a lovely  believable  clever  and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing  at least  for this viewer  . high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters  superb writing  always interesting and witty dialogs  two awesome performances  and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is . julie delpy  who looks like a botticelli  s angel  is great in portraying smart  independent  and incredibly attractive young woman .  

=======================================================================================================

658 ===> first let me say that before sunrise  like all movies  is not a movie for all tastes . it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact  but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people . for me  like most folks here  before sunrise struck a deep chord in me  i was truly stunned  moved  inspired by it . this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing . it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine . it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it .  br    br   the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other . it is very intelligent and inspiring  not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine  s discussions  but rather the little nuances  the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other . it captures an honest  romantic  yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world . and what happens after that night is open for debate  but i never doubt that they won  t each other again .  br    br   the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie .  br    br   see it and it may change your way of life .  

=======================================================================================================

659 ===> this must be one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen  the graphics are ridiculous  and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process .  br    br   i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie  so i can  t say i  m picky . i have been struggling to find something to compare it to  but i just can  t think of anything that matches this  maybe starship troopers  . witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player  but compared to this its effects are great . the acting superb and the script should be awarded . you know when a movie is bad in a funny way  well folks this isn  t one of those this kills your soul minute by minute .  

=======================================================================================================

660 ===> b movie at best . sound effects are pretty good . lame concept  decent execution . i suppose it  s a rental .  br    br    you put some olive oil in your mouth to save you from de poison  den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen . you gonna be ok tommy .   br    br    you stay by the airphone  when agent harris calls you get me    give me a fire extinguisher .   br    br    weapons  we need weapons . where  s the silverware  all we have is this . sporks     br    br   dr price is the snake expert .  br    br   local ers can handle the occasional snakebite . alert every er in the tri  city area .  

=======================================================================================================

661 ===> there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime  but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives . these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don  t meet these people anymore . we don  t always even know their names  as we are never presented to each other  and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are . it  s funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such  because reuniting might spoil fond memories  or we don  t know do they . we are too afraid to check that out .  br    br   the movie  before sunrise  just caught me watching it . i never had intention to watch it through  but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting  i gave a look for the rest of the film . i didn  t know what to expect from it  but nor did the young couple . they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate . i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through . it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives .

662 ===> if you are a traveller  if there is a fire burning into your heart  if you  d call  home  every place on earth  but none of them can give you enough  if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there  see this movie and you  ll find out a little  but wonderful  piece of life sitting next to you .  

=======================================================================================================

663 ===> oh dear lord  how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone  it reeks of cheese from start to finish  but it  s not even good cheese . it  s the scummiest  moldiest  most tasteless cheese there is  and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually  truly enjoyed it . yes  if you saw it with a load of drunk  stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way  but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen . i watched it with an up  for  a  few  laughs guy  having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film  s expected crapness . we got the crapness  plenty of it   but not the chuckles . it doesn  t even qualify as a so  bad  it  s  good movie . it  s just plain bad . very  very bad . here  s why  look away if you  re spoilerphobic   the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death . ok  i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was  but i think i grasped the  this guy is a bit of a badass who you don  t want to mess with  message behind the ingenious scene . oh  and a guy witnesses it . so  we already have our ultra  evil bad guy  and wussy but cute  apparently  good guy . cue hero . big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion  saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish  i . e . hero is immune to bullets  everyone else falls over rather clumsily . cue first plot hole . how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was  or that he  d watched the murder . perhaps this  and the answers to all my plot  hole related questions  was explained in the  minutes before i got into the cinema  but i doubt it . in fact  i  m going to stop poking holes in the plot right here  lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese  which we all know is good cheese  . so  the  plot   a very generous word to use  . good guy must get to la  evil guy would rather he didn  t  hero sam stands between the two . cue scenery for the next vomit  inducing hour  the passenger plane . as i said  no more poking at plot holes  i  ll just leave it there . passenger plane . next  the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie  and what makes it everything it is  snakes . yay  oh  pause . first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have . hot  horny couple  see if you can guess how they die   dead  before  any  snakes  even  appear british guy  those pesky brits  eh    cute kids  and jo brand . for all you americans that  s an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness . now that we  ve met the cast  let  s watch all of them die  except of course the cute kids  . don  t expect anything original  it  s just snake bites on various and ever  increasingly hilarious  really not  parts of the body . use your imagination  since the film  makers obviously didn  t use theirs .  br    br   so  that  s most of the film wrapped up  so now for the best bit  the ending . as expected  everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face . yep  ice  cool sammy included . but wait  we  re not all off the plane yet  the last guy to get off is good guy  but just as he does he gets bitten by a  you guessed it  snake  of all things  . clearly this one had been hiding in mr . jackson  s hair the whole time  since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier  despite the    ft constrictor  the one that ate that pesky british bugger  being unable to . so  sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop . at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much  needed u  turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort . but no . in a kind of icing on the cake way  but with stale cheese  remember   it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest . how anyone can think that an audience   years ago  let alone in     would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me  but it did well in summing up the film .  br    br   actually  we  re not quite done yet . after everyone has sucked face  uncle sam with leading actress  good guy with tiffany  token black guy with token white girl  and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia   it  s time for good guy and hero to get it on . . . . in bali    nope  it wasn  t at all exciting  the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll . yes  the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred  and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times . that  s it . this is the first time i  ve ever posted a movie review  but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography . if you like planes  snakes  samuel l . jackson  air hostesses  bad guys  surfing  dogs in bags or english people  then please  please don  t see this movie . it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you  ll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again . go see united   instead . that was good .

664 ===> this is not a film you can really analyse separately from it  s production . the audience became the film  makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend . how is it possible to be objective  this is our movie  isn  t it  or is it  there may be nothing more disingenuous than a film  maker who promotes himself as the audience  s friend  giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them . just look at that prime self  publicist eli roth  promising gore  hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films  only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like  hostel  .  br    br   david r . ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film  but he was  quite understandably  quick to engage with it . he took the carnival  huckster school of film  making to a new level  getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy . so many have enthused over this interactive  democratic approach to film  making that they seem to have missed the point  that this is the most cynical form of film  as  marketing . nothing is included that the film  makers know the fans won  t buy  and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated . the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know .  br    br   isn  t this just the evolution of the focus group approach  individual creativity  talent  craft  ideas  all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses . it  s a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don  t make for good movies  why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different  because we happen to be film fans  well  thank god for us  because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake .  br    br   so  yes  i had fun at the movie  a midnight showing  fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice  cream  but it actually had relatively little to do with the film  and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere . like christmas  everyone seemed determined that they would have fun  no matter what . there was laughter  but i don  t know if it was with the film  or at the film . with a film as calculated as this one  is that even a meaningful distinction  there are some genuinely good aspects to the film . samuel l . jackson gives a well  judged performance  pure self  parody but with a real sense of pleasure . rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles  and there are one or two inspired moments  the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate .  br    br   the stock characters are to be expected  but the total lack of suspense isn  t . what  s the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there  s no creeping menace  there are several snake  jumps  out moments  but they  re incredibly badly staged . only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene  the other killings are oddly flat . the demise of the honeymoon couple  for instance  is shamefully botched . most of the actors fail to make an impression it  s a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired  when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller  coaster  she could be talking to the audience  the film falls far short  .  br    br   there are worse movies  but there are many  many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with  lake placid   and it  s as apt a contrast as any i can think of . that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent  the jokes were funny  the suspense sequences were scary  and it wasn  t devised by committee . that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus . i don  t need a post  pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film .  br    br   this film will  in time  fade to become a mere footnote in film history . if it sets a precedent  however  i  m genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time . in all probability  nothing much will come of it . perennial popcorn favourites   raiders of the lost ark    alien    halloween  and of course   star wars   just aren  t produced by group  think .  br    br   in the mean time  i  ll tell you what  i haven  t half got a craving for some ingmar bergman .

665 ===> many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with  the mortal storm  or  casablanca  . everyone is entitled to compare films they choose  but the similarities of  the mortal storm  and  watch on the rhine  are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut  while the main comparative point brought out with  casablanca  is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in     by the academy of motion picture arts and science  because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar . it does not strike me as totally wrong . lukas had a good career in film  both here and in england  he is the villain in  the lady vanishes    and this performance was his best one . bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine  for instance  he was ignored for sam spade in  the maltese falcon  and roy earle in  high sierra  two years earlier  both of which were first rate performances  and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c . dobbs in  the treasure of sierra madres   the writer  murder suspect in  in a lonely place   and captain philip francis queeg in  the caine mutiny  afterward  he got it for charley in  the african queen   . i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs  but it did not happen . but lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career . few can claim that .  br    br   to me the film to look at with  watch on the rhine  is based on another play  script by hellman   the searching wind  . they both look at america  s spirit of isolationism in the     s and     s .  the searching wind  is really looking at the whole inter  war period  while  watch on the rhine   set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii  deals with a few weeks of time . therefore it is better constructed as a play  and more meaningful for it  s impact .  br    br   the film has many good performances  led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti  nazi fighter  courier  davis as his loyal wife  wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play  s activities   coulouris as the selfish  conniving  but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck  lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald  as coulouris  wiser and sadder and fed up wife   and kurt katch  who delivers a devastating critique  as the local embassy  s gestapo chief  about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis . it has dialog with bite in it . and what it says is quite true . it also has moments of near poetry . witness the scene  towards the end  when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis  and says   the new world has left the scene to the old world  . hellman could write very well at times .  br    br   given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films .

666 ===> it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other . ethan hawke  jesse   tape     and julie delpy  celine   er    tv series  nicole  . this gal and guy  will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years . jesse and celine have great conversation  and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them . i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in     and if you have viewed this film  you will feel the same way .  

=======================================================================================================

667 ===> this movie was the worst movie i have seen since  date movie .  i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared . it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example  the eye  the tongue  the butt  the breast . if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite . for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person . i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior . i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie . so i don  t recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it .  

=======================================================================================================

668 ===> i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie  rocked  . it is pure cg over  acted crap  don  t send an assassin  it  s much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored  aggressive  venomous snakes on a plane  the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to . it is not  so bad it  s good  it  s so bad i  d rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again . i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane  a spoof  was i wrong . it  s that whole  it sucks  get it   or samuel a . jackson yells  snakes on the plane  thing . well i  m sorry  i don  t get it . it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard . if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung  s cd  still live in their mommies basement  and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn  then rush to the theater and ask for one  since i doubt you have a girlfriend  ticket for snakes on a stupid  butt plane . to hell with movies like full metal jacket  pulp fiction  true romance    monkeys  clerks  etc . there  s no irony in watching good movies . the true decline of the western civilization . calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man  or even orgazmo . i  ve said enough here .  

=======================================================================================================

669 ===> i want cline and jessie go further in their relationship  i want to tell them that they were made for each other  that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other . their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached . this is about love but not stupid things like in  notting hills  or those kind of movie . this is life and i did believe in them  i did believe they were falling . . . this was so clever and touching . i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there . . . i want to go to vienna . i want to see them as soon as possible again .  br    br   i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake  a concept  but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere  somehow and some when  something could really happen .  br    br   i  m french and didn  t know very well july delpy despite kieslowski  three colors  white  . . . now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting .  br    br   i saw  before sunset   the sequel in paris  a few days before i saw  before sunrise  and their is no matter . they are both masterpieces . proof that you don  t need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings . i  m sorry for my english which i m trying to best .  br    br   franck in france

670 ===> while traveling by train through europe  the american jesse  ethan hawke  and the french celine  julie delpy  meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria . on the next morning  jesse returns to united states of america  and celine to paris .  br    br    before sunrise  is one of my favorite romances  indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen . it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline  but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect  and the dialogs are stunning . the direction is amazing  transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer . i have just completed my review number      in imdb  and i choose  before sunrise  for this significant number because it is a very special film for me . i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar  with such a magnificent screenplay  direction and performances . yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time  and i still love it . my vote is ten .  br    br   title  brazil    antes do amanhecer    before sunrise    

=======================================================================================================

671 ===> this movie deserves more than a  . but i  m giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a   resulting in it getting a rating that  ll take it into the top    list . seriously it  s not that great its not that bad . its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it  s ridiculous . these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say  i  m rick james b  tch  no matter how old or annoying it gets . i dread having to hear  i  m tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane  months from now from idiots trying to be funny . its crappy plot crap acting etc . its okay to love a bad movie  but you still gotta admit its a bad movie .  br    br   wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie  

=======================================================================================================

672 ===> when discussing a movie titled  snakes on a plane   we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot .  br    br   what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes . snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy  they crawl they slither . these snakes do nothing of the sort . they glide along like they would in a video game . they are cartoon snakes . i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary  br    br   why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures  why not rely on suspense . . the whole  less is more  ethic . or better still  why not just make them look good in the first place  and then maybe still use them sparingly  br    br   take one look at john carpenters  the thing  . here we have real slime  and gore of eerie proportions .   years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap  snakes on a plane  . when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee  special effects are going backwards   br    br   sure you could say . . but the movie is a joke  get it  sure i  m with that idea  but do it well  in addition to the above  this movie has crap dialogue . and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way .  br    br   i could handle every other actor being part of this movie  except for jackson . what was he doing there  the man who starred in pulp fiction   years ago . is this career progression  are you offering people value for money  no . i  d like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie  br    br   the current generation seem to have very low expectations . and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want . on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including . . . doa dead or alive   another  cgi animal film called  flushed away   and another crap looking comedy named  click  . in addition to that i saw some awful trailers  including one for  another  crap british horror  comedy . i  ve truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time  br    br   expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for   in  months time . and if you  re expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes  and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips . forget it .  

=======================================================================================================

673 ===> this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy  meets  girl movies ever made . while  rebel without a cause  and  say anything  deliver nice portrayals  this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences . this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance . you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people . you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine  and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it . this movie is mostly all dialogue  based . but  every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing . what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is . how in all that conversation  while often having no real bearing on anything critical  you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other . this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone . and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe . this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random . and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place . it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests . and no matter how many times i watch this film  i don  t think i will ever tire of that .  

=======================================================================================================

674 ===> this movie is not about entertainment  or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time . this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god . one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie . we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie . there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed . god  s love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal . there is the love in a marriage . while the main character grapples with his wife  s disease  he realizes through god  s love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine . he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated . finally  you have the love of child and parent . the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear . dear friends  love is not love unless it comes from god  because god is love and love comes from god . talk to someone and let them know you love them . love does no good unless it is given to another . i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it . amen    

=======================================================================================================

675 ===> i  d give this a negative rating if i could . i went into this movie not expecting much  but i had an open mind . the whole thing is stupid  the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson . oh how original if i were a   year old boy i might laugh at that . i have no idea how this movie became so popular . seriously  the worst thing i  ve ever seen . i wasn  t entertained  it wasn  t funny  i wasn  t even bored  i wasn  t anything . it wasn  t even so bad it was good  it  s just bad . ridiculous actually . please do not waste your money on this movie . don  t even rent this movie . no clue how it  s getting such a high rating .  

=======================================================================================================

676 ===> what can i say  i  m a secret fan of  over the top  action and horror films . especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo  but i  m not a fan of snake on a plane .  br    br   there are three potential draws to this film  the comedy of the situation  the horror and  the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane .  br    br   firstly  this film isn  t written as a tongue  in  cheek horror or a comedy  and there are only  or  points in the film where you  ll smile to yourself . if you want to get the feel of the film  the trailer genuinely represents the movie  a horror .  br    br   secondly  if you  re expecting a film full of action and shocks  you won  t be disappointed . it doesn  t stand out above other movies  but it always keeps your attention .  br    br   thirdly  although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn  t wear off  but you  ll leave the cinema thinking  what was all the fuss about  .  br    br   i know this movie has a high rating  but it doesn  t add up . a  many of the reviews where written before the film was released and  b  the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal    of people rating the movie       with only   of people giving it      why such an enormous gap   

=======================================================================================================

677 ===> this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today . as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer  s or who are in the formative stages  i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease . the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle . casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line .  

=======================================================================================================

678 ===> i wasn  t expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you  d expect to be living next door . they are ordinary flesh  and  blood people  not like the typical hollywood fare . they face an all too common problem   debilitating illness . but the story  line grips the heart with a powerful lesson . casting  script  direction  and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story . give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire .  

=======================================================================================================

679 ===> disjointed  unclear  bad screenplay  poor photography and direction . . . all in all very obviously an ill  conceived first effort at commercial film  making by the good people at tbn .  br    br   tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring  china cry   the story of nora lam  to the big screen . but  the omega code  is an unfortunate miscue . as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved  china cry   i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone . they do much good with their ministry  but this isn  t an example of it . don  t waste your money . . . go rent  china cry  instead .  

=======================================================================================================

680 ===> raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real . unfortunately  there is no reality to this film . the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake .  br    br   the reason  bad directing . peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal . it seems mr . sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel . wrong  it just gives it a badly  made feel . similarly  shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film  it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what  s on screen instead of enhance it .  br    br   of course  what  s on screen is so painfully fake  as if mr . sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look  hip  to his sundance buddies and show how  edgy  a filmmaker he is .  br    br   overall  the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr . sollett is . next time  how about taking a few writing and directing classes   

=======================================================================================================

681 ===> this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption . i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family . well  acted and well  directed . if there were any flaws  i  d have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again . what about all people of all cultural backgrounds  i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown  like in real life . nevertheless  the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker . loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes  

=======================================================================================================

682 ===> a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie . it  s based on a novel of the same title  which was equally good  though different from the film . really made you think about how you  d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters . recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent  spouse  or family member   in other words  everyone   br    br   though the production isn  t quite hollywood quality   no big special effects   still  the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it . and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members  and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill .  br    br   you don  t want to miss this   

=======================================================================================================

683 ===> interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code . . . many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts . . . the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video  to be stocked besides the three  part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the   s . . dont remember it  you wont remember this one either in a year or two . this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls . . . very shameful . . . this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist  s son  you too can play high  roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money . . .  

=======================================================================================================

684 ===> what was this about   pre  destination  you can not change the future cause it has already been written    br    br   i  ll give it this much . i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie . this movie took a concept and made it watchable .  br    br   if you  re looking for a recommendation  see it at matinee prices . no thrills but an interesting concept . they should have left the y  k reference out . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

685 ===> when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas  its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film . yet  having read the content  i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie . the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me . a vow to cherish is  without any doubt  one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema . here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema .  br    br   first  the entire content is particularly educational . it has something to offer to the modern audience  pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions . is there a need for christ in our times  does love still matter  what for is there faith  what is the logics of burden and suffering in life  is there really someone by my side i can always trust  the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us .  br    br   second  the movie is exceptionally humane . the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions . is it better for kyle david denman  and teri  megan paul  to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home  is it better for john  ken howard  to leave ellen  barbara babcock   his sick wife  and start a new happy life with julia  donna bullock   a woman he falls in love with  in fact  ellen no longer recognizes him . . . yet  he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity . had john  s rebellious brother  phil  d . david morin   better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life . phil  s prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity . these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where  when or how they live .  br    br   third  the movie is a great portrayal of family  not very popular nowadays there are problems  yet  there is always something more powerful that gets these people together . this  something  is love and trust . i know that it may seem a bit idealistic . not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that . nevertheless  it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one .  br    br   fourth  the entire film focuses on people  s mutual help . if we want to live happy lives in our society  we must understand one thing we have to help one another . alexander  ossie davis  is an example of such attitude . at the beginning of the movie  we see him talk to john about praying . later  he helps his brother . alexander is a kinda  angel  that is sent to john and his family . isn  t it possible that we may become angels to one another   br    br   fifth  the artistic features are also worth attention . performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role  she does a perfect job . consider  for instance  the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again . ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband . picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves  autumn  while the sunshine  love  spreads everywhere . i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow  this can always be illuminated by light and joy . . .  br    br   a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love  what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe . at the end  i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do  br    br   kyle to his uncle phil yes  he  john brighton  lives according to the bible . but nobody forces you to do so . yet  according to what rules do you live   

=======================================================================================================

686 ===> for all of you that don  t speak swedish the swedish original title of this film  rnarna  translates into something in the line of  the robbers  . this fact is the main problem i have with the film  cause it  s not really about the robbers at all . it  s about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies . a regular desk job one would think  but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands  as the story goes  even shooting one of the robbers . . . exactly we  ve seen this before . the fact that there  s a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn  t really help as the ending is just as clich as the first two thirds of the film .  br    br   what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it  s masterfully executed in all ways  that the actors are as great as they are and don  t overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story .  br    br   one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it  s music sets the right mood when it  s needed  but is absent for the rest of the time  which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car  chases spread throughout the film . a nice touch  the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he  s not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background  but that  s something you have to neglect .  br    br   all in all it  s an entertaining film that steals more money in it  s plot than time from you .      

=======================================================================================================

687 ===> this movie is not based on the bible . it completely leaves christ out of the movie . they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ . let alone talk about it . it does not quote from scriptures . the end times are called the great tribulation . the movie does not even show bad times . the seven bowls  seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a   second news cast of the sea changing it  s structure . the anti  christ was killed     years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended . the only part they got correct was there was two prophets . the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures . the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie . i wanted to take unsaved people to it . i feel that the movie is evil . it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does . i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books .  br    br   the second problem with the movie is it was just bad . bad acting  bad special effects  bad plot and poor character development . i have seen better episodes of miami vice .

688 ===> i truly wish i was not writing this review . i  m a christian  so i waited anxiously to see this movie . it seemed great   a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing  not that i buy the bible code itself   you can make it say anything you want . i do  however believe everything inside the bible  . so i  m sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews  when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes . i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater  i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes  i  m sure  . once the final credits began to roll  however  i could reflect . there were many parts of the movie i liked   some mostly unexpected plot twists  some effects that were indeed special  i  m not counting the visions . those were poorly done   and some interesting technical work   fades  sets  that type of thing . unfortunately  i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour  i could  ve gotten a better script . and the music was beyond cheesy  even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue  . so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater   like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was   but i  m not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it . i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies  and this just didn  t have either . i  m sorry  but i wouldn  t recommend this film to anyone . and that  s the tragedy . when will we see some intelligent christian fiction  it has to be out there somewhere . . .

689 ===> that certain thing is the story of a gold digger  viola dana  from a tenement house . her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers  but they are a loving family . although dana  s character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor  she refuses and holds out for a millionaire . everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy  but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire  son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain . the two marry hastily  but the girl  s dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger . however  she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own .  br    br   a rare glimpse of movie star viola dana  this film is a lot of fun . dana  s role is accessible  natural  and entertaining . she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama .  br    br   the mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too . the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility . the title cards are also incredibly clever .  br    br   if you like films like my best girl  it  or the patsy  you will enjoy this film .  

=======================================================================================================

690 ===> but sadly due to rights issues  that almost certainly will never happen . transcripts of joe bob  s commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet  but they don  t quite capture his twang inflected delivery  which was a real hoot . nowadays  joe bob  real name john bloom  is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as  i spit on your grave   featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time   and jason x  one of the most reviled friday the   th sequels of all time  the series was never the same once it left paramount  . all i could think when they canceled it was  damn  where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping  blonde jokes  and horror trivia every saturday night  does this mean i have to get a life now   sadly  it does . but there  ll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for  monstervision .  long live the drive  in   

=======================================================================================================

691 ===> if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become  this one would take the prize . the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power  seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world . just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be   br    br   the acting was bad at best . casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film . michael york  s work was a fair match for the role  since he was the center of the film  and did a good job .  br    br   this plot was sickening and very disturbing . no tender or immature minds should see this film . this is how a basic good vs . evil plot can go astray .  br    br   there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles  who look for ways to market this type of junk . there must have been something censored out to get a pg    rating  but it was still awful .  

=======================================================================================================

692 ===> i didn  t know what to expect from the film . well  now i know . this was a truly awful film . the screenplay  directing and acting were equally bad . the story was silly and stupid . the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film  but he didn  t . i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad . where was the focus to the film  where was anything in this film  christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it . it was shabbily done and a waste of my money . do not see this film .  

=======================================================================================================

693 ===> i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in     . i was  at the time  and now at the age of   it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it . the    s all of a sudden seem so far away  what a great decade . anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time  as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films . it was like the    s version of chiller theater . if mst  k can get dvd  s why not joe bob  s show  at least monstervision was more interesting and informative . a lot of joe bob  s comments and info on the films were just hilarious . most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen . many were oddball flicks that you wouldn  t see anywhere else like the the japanese sci  fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell . with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors  i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up  since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show . i  m sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day  i guess will have to wait and see . until then  thats great television    

=======================================================================================================

694 ===> probably my all  time favorite movie  a story of selflessness  sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause  but it  s not preachy or boring . it just never gets old  despite my having seen it some   or more times in the last   years . paul lukas  performance brings tears to my eyes  and bette davis  in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles  is a delight . the kids are  as grandma says  more like  dressed  up midgets  than children  but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mother  s slow awakening to what  s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs  they  d all be  up  for this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

695 ===>  . . . . this movie basks too much in its own innocence . it doesn  t tell a story it  s more a big time snooze fest . while the actors are all personable  the story is so trite and goes nowhere . i think victor rasuk has great charisma  but deserves a real film from a real storyteller .  

=======================================================================================================

696 ===> what else is left to say   br    br   i  ve read all the reviews here and most are right on . . however  one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it  or something along those lines  . evil   wow  what a shocker . . i mean  tbn basically made this film . open your eyes please .  br    br   anway  this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years .  br    br   the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it . if this movie can be made  there are no limits  and therefore  we have no choice but to get ready for  yentl    and  ernest loses the omega codes .   br    br   for those of you who are into the biblical stories  the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started .  

=======================================================================================================

697 ===> i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy  i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business . . . who are now still trying to become adults . . . . no more fans  groupies  money etc . . . and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life . . . as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight . . . it is almost like they have to begin anew . . . this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the    s and    s are going through now . . . . and that  s where i find the film sad and depressing . but it portrays the life of an old rock star  abandoned and lost  in a believable way . the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren  outrageous  . . . and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for . this film is a must have for folks in their    s who have seen the rise and fall of bands  people who knew the members  and have watched them hurt as age creeps in  and popularity fades . this is an almost perfect movie . . . . sad but in a way positive . . . . because of the whales . a must see   

=======================================================================================================

698 ===> anyone who loves the rheostatics  music is going to enjoy this film . i have some minor complaints  mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors  not maury  who aren  t really convincing in their roles  but i don  t have time write a detailed review . i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader  s digest version of whale music    don  t watch it . it cuts out entire scenes and subplots  if you can them that  from the film . the cbc  which presents most of films untouched  took half the guts out of whale music . i don  t know why . it  s horrible what they did to the film . rent the video or watch it in a theatre  but don  t watch it on cbc television .  

=======================================================================================================

699 ===> i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character . words cannot describe  nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was . but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting  terrible dialog  corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force  fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network . its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep  religious message attached to it . they failed miserably . it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time .  

=======================================================================================================

700 ===> i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about   people . we all expected a good piece of christian film  making . what we got was an excruciatingly painful  drawn  out  and pretty boring attempt at a film . it has good looking production values but also has poor acting  a weak script with lousy dialogue  and no real sense of direction . from the first   minutes we all knew it would be a long night . we all hated it  and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than  anaconda .  none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than  hours . flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can  t save this bad  bad movie . i  d give it a  out of    and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable  movie  werewolf       the night before i saw this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

701 ===> i was amazingly impressed by this movie . it contained fundamental elements of depression  grief  loneliness  despair  hope  dreams and companionship . it wasn  t merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music . he finds a companion who comes with her own issues . claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst .  br    br   des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star . yet he has musical genius . he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate  while things around him literally go to ruins . his focus is creating his whale music  in fact it becomes an obsession for him .  br    br   claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay . she finds hidden talents while being in des company . she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her . she learns to trust him over a period of time .  br    br   these two find love with one another . not the mind blowing  sex infused kind of passion  but a love where friendship and understanding means more . for two people who have been hurt  they find trust together .  

=======================================================================================================

702 ===> a friend of mine recommended this movie  citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl  the movie  s main character . i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more  i  m not very sure whether or not that  s flattering portrayal .  br    br   this is a pretty unique work  the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance  not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue  whale music is just so much more  well  relaxed .  but instead that they both represent modern love stories .  br    br   in general i  m a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians  for example i highly recommend hard core logo  and this film in particular . it has an innocent charm  des is not always the most likeably guy  but there  s something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy .  

=======================================================================================================

703 ===> i am a youth pastor  s wife and we took some youth to see this film . we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them . they didn  t get it and i didn  t enjoy it . it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world  the bible code  the torah code and the code in the koran  and is so questionable as to be laughable . this is not a step forward for christians in the arts  it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door .  

=======================================================================================================

704 ===> i  m a christian . i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians  however . as a rule  they are  know  nothings  when it comes to movie production . i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen . however  they did a hideous job of it . the acting was horrible  and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion  one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across . not only was the movie terribly made  but the people who made it even had some facts wrong . however  in this  critique   those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into . in short  the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen  and i would not recommend it to anyone  except for comic relief from the every day grind .  

=======================================================================================================

705 ===> walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema . how do you get laughs out of other people  s misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long   br    br   well  this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs  beautiful scenery  and quite a good buzz as well . i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it  and marijuana illegal  since  those other races  used it . . . undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world .  br    br   an extraordinary  dvd extra  commentary . . . two of them in fact . . . run thru the whole movie with both the actors  and then again with the writers . i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie  but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take . what a hoot  don  t miss it      stars  

=======================================================================================================

706 ===>   br    br   this is definitely a  must see  for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide  out  trying to avoid being caught by parents  teachers  the police  etc . . . the protagonist is a lady in her forties  living in her mansion  breeding orchids  and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so  called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her . when he all of the sudden dies  she is confronted with the truth . the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt . she doesn  t know what to do  until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain . she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead . . . the story is quite original  the performances outstanding  i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one . still  the melodramatic touch is present . the film is typical british the jokes aren  t vulgar  there is no violence involved . it shouldn  t be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching  saving grace  . it will be so much more fun  especially the scene with the  old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious . i thought my jawbones would burst .      

=======================================================================================================

707 ===> i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry . the first   minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society  men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do  the movie falls . becoming boring and not funny at all . they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable . i didn  t like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either . i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed .  br    br   i don  t recommend this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

708 ===> i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons . for the first half hour it  s actually pretty decent . although the acting isn  t any better then that which you would find in a rap video  its kinda funny and the production value doesn  t seem half bad . in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao  another recent dominican film  which turned out to be much much better than i expected . the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole  which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic . unfortunately i don  t think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter  and they f  ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them . about   minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits . not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge  space age  cgi effects dating to what i  m guessing would be the    s  but the whole plot just goes down the drain . the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations  and clever one liners . to top it all off  and i guess i should warn you now spoiler alert  it all turns out to be a dream . oh my who didn  t see that coming  oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie . well after about an hour into it i start thinking  hmmmm something just doesn  t seem right about the sound track but what can it be    and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter   .  br    br   when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art     perhaps a comedy to match france  s amelie  or an action flick to match thailand  s ong  bak  an animation as akira was to japan  a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england  or a socio  awakening journey as waking life had here in the states .  br    br   . . . i would give it a  but i  ve seen much worse come out of dr  search los jodedores and you  ll know what i  m talking about .  

=======================================================================================================

709 ===> it may  or may not  be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca       role for the best actor oscar .  i still would have given the oscar to bogie  but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination  at least .  well  i  m glad i did check this movie out  because i enjoyed it immensely . i think the movie did preach a little  but not only did i not mind  i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them .  br    br   the acting was outstanding in this movie . i especially enjoyed paul lukas  lucile watson  rightfully nominated for an oscar   bette davis  wrongfully not nominated   george coulouris and  oddly  eric roberts  who plays the middle child . i really enjoyed his character an odd  looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher . he just cracks me up . even the characters name  bodo  is funny .  br    br   the ending  in which lukas  s character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons  worked for me as well . i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did  and i understood why he couldn  t quite explain it . the message this movie makes is a good and noble one  the scenery  meaning the house  is beautiful  and the acting is the excellent . watch this movie if you ever get a chance .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

710 ===> this is an hilarious movie . one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor . from the largest role to the smallest  each character is vivid  unforgettable and so understandable . it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve .  

=======================================================================================================

711 ===> it has a great name  but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money  in fact the first      mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone .  br    br   and yet the producers  roberto angel salcedo  calls him an actor  but i don  t think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting   . . . . period . the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing .  br    br   for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it  but they didn  t   and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad  i don  t buy it .  br    br   but hopefully this is as bad as it gets . to make people accept those dvd  s to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it  that might work out .  br    br   maka  

=======================================================================================================

712 ===> the film is poorly casted  except for some familiar old hollywood names . other performances by unknown names  i . e .  jennifer gabrielle  are uninspiring . i have seen other films by this director  unfortunately this is one of his worst . perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay   br    br   in a positive note  kim bassinger  s and pat morita  s performance saved the movie from oblivion . i enjoyed pat more in karate kid  though . there are many good movies to see  and in short  this one is not one of them . save your money and the celluloid .  br    br   jason vanness  

=======================================================================================================

713 ===> i love this film . it  s one of those i can watch again and again . it is acted well by a good cast that doesn  t try too hard to be star studded .  br    br   the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller . either would have killed the film completely .  br    br   the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel  good factor throughout .  br    br   it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes . . .  no that  s not a spoiler    

=======================================================================================================

714 ===> yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award  material . but then it doesn  t try to be anything it is not . a fun  filled romp with real funny one  liners  a stellar and very funny performance by peter o  toole  a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright . the band  s performance was on the spot  each one playing their role in a deft  comical manner . the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely . from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads . a good example is the comment about the  strange baseball  like game   well my dear american  that was cricket  from which baseball is derived  and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket . also no  you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window it was funny how lord foxley said  oh yes   to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time  oh no  also referring to the money . jeez  it seems that every joke must be explained to some people . . . all  in  all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs  well worth seeing .  

=======================================================================================================

715 ===> i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight . it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer . the plot had potential  who wouldn  t love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets   but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing . towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he  s going to return  then a group of stars moves together to form an  elvis  constellation  which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators  sending them crashing through the roof . bad . . . really bad . which is the theme for the whole movie . i  d avoid this one at all costs .  

=======================================================================================================

716 ===> being an elvis fan  i can  t understand how this proyect could be done . is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time  totally unfunny  silly and plenty of mistakes about the king . come on  elvis  grave in a public park  a mention about suspicious minds in      . . . and these are just two examples . some people in the cast tries to do their best  mike starr is funny  specially as an impersonator   the tom hanks cameo is a surprise  but the guy playing the young elvis sucks . overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute . if you want to see an ultra cheap  insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis  i truly recommend you  bubba ho  tep  instead of this mess .  

=======================================================================================================

717 ===> i saw it last night on tv  and was quite delighted .  br    br   it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart  and believe that there is still some goodness in the world  all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her  the old policeman is my favourite   although you know that this story is not quite realistic .  br    br   i loved acting  they all seemed just as ordinary  common people  living in small picturesque english coast town  but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has  just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their  tea     br    br   perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing  but it didn  t stop me from really  really enjoying the whole story   

=======================================================================================================

718 ===>   saving grace  is never riotously funny  but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree . brenda blethyn is a fine actress  and does a good job at portraying widower grace  who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts . the supporting cast also does a fine job . french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role . the premise alone is appealing . the idea of an over  the  hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough . and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then . of course  there are flat moments  like one where two elderly women mistaken grace  s marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work . that was a mindless gag that didn  t quite take off . the film  s tone is downbeat and occasionally dull  but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation .  br    br   my score   out of     

=======================================================================================================

719 ===> my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie  impressive cast  even for the supporting characters  none of which helps this movie really . i have to admit though  tom hank  s cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about tom  did you lose a bet  the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though  by far a classic  the premise is good . basinger  s character  struggling with existence as a pink lady  is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales . this happens as corbett  s character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex  wife motivated by . what else . extortion . as they both make their way  they have numerous run  ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas . soon  the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer . unfortunately  premise doesn  t mean the movie was good .  br    br   when watching this movie  imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren  t really important . it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn  t really make sense . the movie tries hard  but ultimately falls way way way short . ultimately  it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny .  br    br   it isn  t the worst  but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one don  t say i didn  t warn you

720 ===> omg  the only reason i  m giving this movie a  instead of a  is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis  in  the  box . apart from that  how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie   maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time . . . there are no laughs to mention  the stereotypes are pathetic  the cast is wasted  the direction is amateurish . now that i think about it  most of the blame probably lies with the director  joel zwick . he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved . don  t waste your time like i did but then  i enjoy a good train wreck . geez  now the system is telling me i need more lines   here ya go this movie should be called return to sender . okay  now that was funnier than anything in the movie . . .

721 ===> after her oscar  nominated turn in  secrets  lies   brenda blethyn starred in the equally great  saving grace  . and let me tell you  this is not the sort of movie that you find every day .  br    br   after her husband commits suicide  grace trevethyn  brenda blethyn  discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt . fortunately  she finds a way to make ends meet marijuana . that  s right  grace starts cultivating it .  br    br   every aspect of this movie was played to great effect there isn  t a dull moment anywhere in it . and i sure didn  t see that end scene coming  but anyway  you gotta see this movie . you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it . if nothing else  it might function as a good lesson about knowing one  s finances . but of course  there  s a lot more to it than that   

=======================================================================================================

722 ===> this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value . it gets quite hysterically funny at times  but if you haven  t spent any time on  that  side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts .  br    br   the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles . how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played . she  s a true lady . and  my favorite is grace  s white pimp suit that she wears .  br    br   i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud  who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different .  

=======================================================================================================

723 ===> i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if toms midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . when i was a child i wasnt really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count  br    br   judging by this film version of toms midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didnt have in the     s so i guess theres some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . theres also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories  perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative  br    br   this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . its inoffensive but im surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters . i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were   year olds whod just seen the lord of the rings trilogy

724 ===> raising victor vargas a review  br    br   you know  raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big  steaming bowl of oatmeal . it  s warm and gooey  but you  re not sure if it feels right . try as i might  no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn  t quite feel right . victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director  s part . apparently  the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side  and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof . he was right  but it didn  t fool me . raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen  year old boy called  you guessed it  victor vargas  victor rasuk  who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they  ve toured . the movie starts off in ugly fat  donna  s bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her  but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best  friend harold  kevin rivera  comes  a  looking for him . caught in the attempt by harold and his sister  victor vargas runs off for damage control . yet even with the embarrassing implication that he  s been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood  nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat . on a hot  new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor  s eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy  judy marte   who  s not just pretty  but a strong and independent too . the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film . the story also focuses on victor  s family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita  altagracia guzman   his brother nino  also played by real life brother to victor  silvestre rasuk  and his sister vicky  krystal rodriguez  . the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family . victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp  daddy  his feelings for judy and his grandmother  s conservative catholic upbringing .  br    br   the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few  but glaring errors . throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky  nino  grandma  judy and even judy  s best friend melonie . the problem is  we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood . we know that he knows how to lick his lips  and comb his fro  and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack  but that  s all . we know that nino plays piano  and quiet well  you could see it by the awards on the family piano . we know his sister nicki  is a gossip  loving girl with an invested interest in watching tv . we know that grandma is a hard  working traditional latina woman who  s trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption . yet where is the titular character  victor vargas  he  s in this movie somewhere  but we only know what the movie tells us . this is by far the film  s biggest flaw . victor vargas isn  t so much a character but a ping  pong ball  bouncing between scenes with judy and his grandmother  but we never get to know who victor vargas really is . this is important because as i  ve mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that he  s a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of manhattan . he  s a total alpha  male . victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . why should anyone  so by the end of the movie  in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has attained any depth and learned the errors of his ways  how could such a two  dimensional character have any depth  if only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand  held shot .  br    br   raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino inner  city neighborhood to the big screen . something that few films have done before in the past . the film has been complimented for feeling so real  and i won  t  br    br   argue with that . i haven  t seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor . seriously  although the movie has some nice shots of the city  the writer  director peter sollett was way too dependent on close  ups and hand  held shots . this problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep  breathing exercises to keep from passing out . as the film continues  the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen you can practically smell victor vargas  s cheap cologne . the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . the indoor scenes of inner  city apartments make them look small and cramp  which is not true . i  ve been in those type apartments i used to live in one . they  re not splendorous but they have high ceilings and they  re decent living spaces . by the movie  s standards you  d think that these apartments were  x  cells of brick  and  mortar  chipped paint and cracked walls . unfortunately  sollett  s constant use of close  ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom  in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . but raising victor vargas is only sollett  s second film  and his most well known  a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . one review i read summarized the movie as  ethnicity for ethnicity  s sake   and i cannot agree more . if victor vargas were truly a great film and story  then the characters  applicability wouldn  t matter whether they were latino  chinese  etc . yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle  class suburbia with a bunch of teeny  bopper white kids the results wouldn  t be such glowing reviews  and we  d see the film  s flaws more clearly . indeed  some other aspects of the use of latinos in this film bother me . while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question . for example  victor  nino and vicky all share the same room to sleep . this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . any self  respecting latino family wouldn  t have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen  year old girl . at first i was unsure  perhaps i was wrong  but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . considering how conservative the grandmother is  you  d think that vicky would have been sleeping in her room .  br    br   as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household  raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full  time  i could relate to the movie in many ways  which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie . unfortunately  my lack of respect for victor vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film . maybe it  s because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my sega genesis when i was seventeen . maybe it  s because without any further introspection by the film  victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hot  blooded latino  who  ll just end up shouting to girls from his car  hey bay  bee  ju want to get into my luv mah  cheen   either way i don  t like him  so ultimately how can i like a film about him  so if you  ll excuse me  i  m going to go stick my hands into a bowl of grits .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

725 ===> yet another example of what british cinema can achieve a simple story  told and acted well . brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace  ably assisted by a solid supporting cast . the  quirky small town  card gets played to the hilt  similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british isles in recent years  ballykissangel  hamish macbeth and others come to mind  . like the forementioned  this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery  in this case the wet and wild cornish coast .  br    br   some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging  others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe . but it  s an enjoyable spliff  to be sure .  

=======================================================================================================

726 ===> a delightful gentle comedic gem  until the last five minutes  which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce . the last five minutes cost it  points in my rating . despite this major plot and style flaw  it  s worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting . many fine little bits to savor  like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card . . . made more piquant when we  re not  quite  sure the card is not maxed .  

=======================================================================================================

727 ===> if you like bad movies  this is the one to see . it  s incredibly low  budget special effects  you  ll see what i mean  and use of non  actors was what gave this film it  s charm . if you  re bored with a group of friends  i highly recommend renting this b movie gem . it  s mulletrific   

=======================================================================================================

728 ===> i would love to have that two hours of my life back . it seemed to be several clips from steve  s animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script . don  t go  if you must see it  wait for the video . . .  

=======================================================================================================

729 ===> this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam  whether financially or emotionally . you will definitely laugh  which is the best medicine    left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies  grace has to find a new way to make some money and it  s not exactly legal which adds to the humour . even my boyfriend liked it so don  t think that it  s a chick  flic .  

=======================================================================================================

730 ===> excellent view of a mature woman  that is going to lose everything  even the pruner has a mortgage  . the way she gets involved into this special  business   the innocence  and the true love that exists between the people of a little town  it  s mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh  light and funny comedy . i couldn  t stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore .  br    br   i love european films  and with movies like this one  my opinion grows stronger . a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed  in this same genre  is waking ned devine .  br    br   saving grace  a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself . you will love it .  

=======================================================================================================

731 ===> on steve irwin  s show  he  s hillarious . he doesn  t even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn  t even what i would call a movie  i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he  s just saying  oh  this is one nasty bloke   and looking straight into the camera . he put his face in the camera too much  and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn  t you expect him to be dead  and terri had the worst acting i  d ever seen  like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says  steve  . she didn  t sound scared or anything  it was just  steve  . i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing . i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid .  

=======================================================================================================

732 ===> i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy  i know i wouldn  t have the nerve to go even  feet away from a croc .  br    br   but  everything in this movie is bad . farting jokes  people getting eaten  and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time .  br    br   it  s a really bad film that you have to stay away from . all the  jokes  are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid . the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is  years old .  br    br   i  m surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this .  

=======================================================================================================

733 ===> great actors  an oscar nominee actress  stunning scenery  good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag  and thats quite big  . this film was brilliant . it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were . . well  side splitting . i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much  and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the  stoned ladies in the tea shop  scene . well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year  if not of all time .  

=======================================================================================================

734 ===> i just thought it was excellent and i still do . i  m grateful we  re still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with . saving grace is smart and enjoyable  those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america  s bride sort of movie .  br    br   saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn  t have to be stupid . i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband  s debts .  br    br   in a nutshell  a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing . you couldn  t ask for more .  br    br       .  

=======================================================================================================

735 ===> so  steve irwin . you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs  snakes  lizards  tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles  and mud  not only daily  but with enthusiasm . he was never able to make me want to do it  but he managed to make his wife come close .  br    br   this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category  the films for people who just had their teeth drilled  have a migraine  or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity  currently well populated by disney films  . it  s too noisy . well  steve is too noisy . he  s just so happy all the time  and would cut right through the blas  teenager  i can hear it now  that movie was so stupid   or the tylenol with codeine . i  d say his enthusiasm is catching  but if it was  i would own a room full of snakes  and that hasn  t happened yet . i agreed they  re beauties  but i  m still not going to pet them .  br    br   plot was indeed predictable . bad guys were so bad  for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore . but the movie was filled with animals  and steve and terri  which is why i watched it . that plot  if you could call it that  was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck . my expectations were low and stayed that way .  br    br   i was hoping  though  that there would be a bit of a sequel  where steve and terri  having worked on their acting skills  have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur . i still can  t believe we won  t see steve anymore . i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel  at least . i can  t imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is . crikey   

=======================================================================================================

736 ===> i caught this at a test screening . all i can say is what . . . the . . . hell  this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for  scarface .  it  s bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car  the film is still so bizarre that it isn  t even funny .  br    br   the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to  save  a crocodile which contains a cia probe . the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back  irwin mistakes them for poachers  and sets out to  stop  them .  br    br   that  s about all the story there is the rest is over  the  top lampooning of australian culture   didja see dat   and  crikey    and strangely choreographed action sequences . at one point  irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it . yes  that  s right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv . let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film .  

=======================================================================================================

737 ===> mario  s first foray into the world of   dimensions is incredible . miyamoto  s masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo   when it was released in     and it still holds all of it  s charm today . this game is an instant classic that set the standard for  d adventure  platform games .  

=======================================================================================================

738 ===> sisters in law will be released theatrically on march   th in sweden . a good occasion for our nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary . it was shown in gteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to kim longinotto   director in focus  of the festival . she gave a master class  very much appreciated  telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice  the first version got lost for good  so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end . a pretty awful problem happened  in this case  to create the possibility of a very strong movie .  

=======================================================================================================

739 ===> this movie has a very broadway feel  the backdrop  the acting  the  noise   and yet that  s all it has . some  sense  of a broadway without the bang .  br    br   the movie is slow  paced  the picture disjointed  the singing  pops up  on you so that you suddenly are reminded it  s a musical .  br    br   disappointing sinatra  br    br   intolerable sinatra  s fianc    surely  the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary .  br    br   tolerable mr  i remember the numbers on my dice   br    br   delight brando  s understated singing  very biased    br    br   surprise how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes . it  s the bone structure  how i would  ve killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again .

740 ===> en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track  but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway   a female reporter runs into a strange hitch  hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination . the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story  an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman  s husband  but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story  a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on .  br    br   the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea  but with only two stories  it falls woefully short . and that  s not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy  with joe haggerty  as the tale  telling ebenezer jackson  giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen   the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there  s a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending . . . . well  that beggars belief .  br    br   to be fair  some of sykes  creative camera  work is effective  although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused  and joe castro  s cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off  eyeballs are plucked out  a face is removed  brains are squished  and there is a messy decapitation . these positives just about make the film bearable  but be warned  the zombie chronicles ain  t a stroll in the park  even for seasoned viewers of z  grade trash .  br    br   i give the zombie chronicles      but generously raise my rating to  since i didn  t get to view the film with the benefit of  d  although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn  t have made that much of a difference  .  

=======================================================================================================

741 ===> although super mario   isn  t like the rest of the games in the series  it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games . games with this much replay value are few and far between . plus  this game has so much variety . there are   levels each with several different tasks you can do  and many other hidden tasks . the game isn  t very challenging  but its lack of challenge doesn  t take away from the game at all . once you beat it  you  ll want to erase your game and start again . and its just as much fun the second time  or third time  or two hundredth time . a must own for any nintendo   owner  and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo   .  

=======================================================================================================

742 ===> super mario   is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created . it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break . i  ve beaten the game  times  but i  ve never gotten all    stars . . .  i  ve gotten     . . . but i hope to achieve them eventually . even though i didn  t officially play this game until i was seven in  i loved watching my sisters play it . now i am   and still play this  erasing games and starting over again .  br    br   the graphics are unbelievable for an early n   game . the gameplay is addictive . the controls are great . the levels are tough  but not impossible . the bowser fights are challenging .  br    br   i would like to tell you more  but why don  t you just get it for yourself  put the x  box     ps   and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo   and play this amazing  wonderful game .

743 ===> some people say steve irwin  s larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act . watch this film it  s obvious he can  t act .  br    br   steve irwin  dangerman star of the small screen in his crocodile hunter diaries  croc files and eponymous crocodile hunter series  you see a naming trend here  or is it just me    rockets his larger  than  strife persona to the big screen with crocodile hunter collision course  yup  there  s a definite trend of words beginning with  c    basically an episode of crocodile hunter mashed together with a b  movie .  br    br   on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer  magda szubanski   steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies  lachy hulme and kenneth ransom   out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed . will it hurt my credibility to say  they  re on a collision course with wackiness    what credibility   ed note .   br    br   the plot is irrelevant  as it is steve  s animal magnetism that propels the film . if you find his persona trying  the film is a failure  but if you  re a fan of either him  as a businessman  conservationist or just plain ass  klown  or his television shows  expect more of the same on a wide  screen budget .  br    br   john stainton  faithful liege  best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter oeuvre  can it be called that with a straight face    writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jester .  br    br   the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve  one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks  and terri  steve  s spouse of   years  fiercest ally and closest friend  treat it like it is one of their documentaries  breaking the  fourth wall  and speaking directly to the camera  whilst all the other characters behave as if they  re in a bad movie  well  . it wouldn  t be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the bad americans constantly threaten steve  s life  we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn  t at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics  or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting  crisp audio and seven action angles .  br    br   while terri is unfairly painted as steve  s mildly incompetent sidekick  her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear  shaped  buttock  hugging jeans  for the last  i  m not complaining   steve goes about his business  as  usual of show  and  tell with creatures intent on killing him  doing all his stunts himself because  well  to him they  re not really stunts  just a day at the office .  br    br   of course  watching this madman  s koo  koo adventures after his tragic death in september     casts a strange detachment over the proceedings . but to those of us who never met him  this kind of malarkey  as well as various incarnations of the crocodile hunter series in constant re  runs  keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows . the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him . and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints  br    br   so enjoy this diversion for what it is  a half  baked movie featuring a full  on legend . he died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife  and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that .  br    br    movie maniacs  visit poffysmoviemania . com   

=======================================================================================================

744 ===> the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters . the different story lines don  t feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times .  br    br   it may sound weak and clich but it  s true you  re way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin . it  s more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is . i  m sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn  t give us the viewers much pleasure . for a comedy it simply isn  t funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren  t good actors  not even when they play themselves  their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene  s feel long  distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times .  br    br   the movie had quite some potential  i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch  so when i first heard that they were making a movie about  the crocodile hunter  my first reaction was brilliant  the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters . the movie does has a certain entertainment value  at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still  i must certainly wouldn  t recommend this movie .  br    br   watching this movie felt like a waste of time . still this movie might be watchable just once  when it gets on tv  on a rainy afternoon . it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential .  br    br

745 ===> when i first got my n   when i was five or six  i fell in love with it  and my first game was super mario   . and i loved it  the graphics were great for it  s time  a good plot  great courses and above all  the best music i heard in a nintendo game .  br    br   i don  t remember the plot completely  but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser  and mario has to rescue her . the object of the game is to get    stars from the curses in the castle . each had about five or six challnges to get the stars . there are secert parts of the castle  where you can get more stars . but of course  you have beat bowser . i think there are three levels to beat bowser on lets start with the characters . mario is the main character  and gets helpful advice from toad  so he is basically one of your only alliances . i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end . the main villain is bowser  and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba . the characters are really great .  br    br   next  how about the graphics  people say gameplay is more important then the graphics  and i agree completely . but with he great plot  there are great graphics . especially for it  s time . i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like    and their graphics don  t compare to super mario . bright colors  great effects and awesome sound effects . i found the graphics in the water courses very very good . next to the bowser world ones  it has the best graphics in the game .  br    br   now  the music . this is my favorite part of the game . growing up  when i played this at a young age  i  d gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep . especially the music from jolly roger bay  which was peaceful and wonderful . there are others that are great too  especially in  once again  the worlds with bowser  are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites .  br    br   this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer  and i love it . this game gets      or          go play the game   

=======================================================================================================

746 ===> or at least one of the best . i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n   . bowser is up to his usual shenanigans  yeah it  s a dumb word but the only one i can think of  and mario must stop him again . this game is very fun to play  and contains lots of nostalgia to me . the only bad thing about it is the graphics  which are awful to today  s standards  but everything else is pretty good  especially the little mini  games you can unlock  it  s the second best n   game  the first best is conker  s bad fur day  that i recommend to any mario fan  or any fan of platform games . it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day .  br    br       or a  

=======================================================================================================

747 ===> i couldn  t watch more than   minutes of it . it  s a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing . the shots used are disgusting  they broke the    degrees angle all the time . my head hurts try to watch that load of  you know what  . dirt on the  mystery machine  window make you see light from the lighting on the windows . . . annoying . what else . . . it  s so badly framed all the time it  s just make you want to scream at that lady directing there . i only directed short films  but i  m pretty sure i  d be way better than that directing a feature film . . . . the story is unbelievable  just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it  s gonna be pretty awful . so pretty much  try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost  it  ll save you the  bucks or so for the rental  and that  h   hour of your life you  ll never get back . . .  

=======================================================================================================

748 ===> if you liked  blair with  you  ll like this one . it has the same lousy camera  work and soundtrack  and it has the same non  existent plot and suspenseful moments .  br    br   it also has tom savini  so if you like romero  s  dawn of the dead  or tarantino and rodriguez   from dusk till dawn  you  re in for a treat . he is an icon and a very good actor as well .  br    br   no  seriously . this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i  ve seen in a long time  and i  ve seen quite a few movies   bad ones as well . i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect  but this was just a pure waste of time .  br    br   the only reason why i gave this movie  instead of   was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp  looking plastic teeth . . . no  i  m just kidding . i must have missed before i hit  submit  on the vote form .  br    br   stay away  even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover   

=======================================================================================================

749 ===> rated e  br    br   i never actually owned a nintendo   but i have played one many times . in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day  super mario   is one of the best video games for the nintendo   system . i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time . if you have an n   and don  t have this game you should try to find it . the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario   has a  d mario in a nice  d environment . the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game . you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the    power stars from bowzer . now you can do it in a  d environment . super mario   is a very fun and good n   game and i recommend it .  br    br         

=======================================================================================================

750 ===> this game is amazing . really  you should get it if you don  t have it . although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out . i believe that this game will always be a classic . it  s just as good a super mario world or so . when i was young  my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did . it  s not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy  but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential . it  s fun entertaining and challenging . everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics   well it did come out in     .  rock on  eva mario luigi and yoshi    nintendo is the best

751 ===> ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b  movies since we do them ourselves . anyway  the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff . . . and tom savini  there is just no way this movie can fail  right  wrong   it just seems like such a waste  there was really no story  the dialog was terrible  is anyone there  x          the characters were . . well  they really lacked any kind of personality . . . the effects were terrible . . and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing . . with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff  we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something . . . anything to happen . . . but no . . .  oh  here comes the nymphs  great  oh . . they  re kissing . . . again . . . and now for the violence  ok . . . nothing really happens . . . again . . . oh  now they run around . . . and the closeups of eyes . . . again . . . oh  heres tom savini  oh . . . he died . . . right . . . ok  maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen . . no . . oh  cool  a severed head  the end . . . oh crap . .  and finally  since i  m so full of myself . . i  ll tell you this  give me a van  six actors  a weird looking house  tom savini  a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you  ve ever seen . . . i  ve made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects  better acting and a better script than this . . . what is this johannes guy doing   making cool movies is easy  it could have been so great . . . i  m really upset

752 ===> i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with  book of shadows   i was wrong . this film makes that look like  the magnficiant ambersons  compared to this piece of shameless  unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie . i  d write more but i  m still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend   renting it  bobbins .  br    br   and were these people english  and where is the forest  i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands . the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation . those angels looked like anorexic pornstars  turned most of them were  did my research  . i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces .  br    br   p . s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act  

=======================================================================================================

753 ===> i have not read the novel  though i understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that i rather enjoyed this  coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre  leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book . having not read a single word of austen  s writing  i really can  t compare this to any of her work . what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever  witty  and well  delivered  as well as the biggest source of comedy in this . this made me laugh out loud a lot  with perfect british and verbal material . every acting performance is spot  on  and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker . the characters are well  written  credible and consistent . i did find a couple of them extremely irritating  however  and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny  it tended to get repeated excessively  and it honestly wasn  t amusing the first time they appeared . the editing and cinematography are marvelous  and everything looks utterly gorgeous . plot and pacing are great  you  re never bored . it does end in a really obvious manner  but maybe that  s what the audience of these prefer . i can  t claim that this did not entertain me  it did from start to finish  and i  d watch it again . there is brief language in this . i recommend this to any fan of romance stories .

754 ===> this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in cameroun  s judicial system   policewomen  lawyers and judges . despite tremendous difficulties   lack of means  the desperate poverty of the people  multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious  ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants   these brave  strong women are making a difference .  br    br   this is a rare thing   a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind . despite the atrocities we see in the movie  justice does get served thanks to these passionate  hardworking women .  br    br   i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states . the more people who see this film  the better .

755 ===> nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc  but the heat is on and he can  t find a secure location . he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can  t make a prim missionary  sarah brown  go out to dinner with him . sky takes up the challenge  but both men have some surprises in store   br    br   this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour  with big sets  loud music  larger  than  life roles and performances to match broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing  which i don  t . my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music . i like all kinds of music  from albinoni to zz top  but broadway show tunes in swing time with never  ending pah  pah  tah  dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren  t my cup of tea . this was written by the tag team of frank loesser  mankiewicz  jo swerling and abe burrows  based on a couple of damon runyon stories   and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak . blaine  s two numbers for example are identical  unnecessary  don  t advance the plot and grate on the ears  and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you  . there are only two memorable tunes  luck be a lady  sung by brando  not sinatra as you might expect  and sit down  you  re rockin  the boat  nicely performed by kaye  but you have to sit through two hours to get to them . the movie  s trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful  laid  back performance he also sings quite well and even dances a little  and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons . the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise  bustle and vowel  murdering of noo yawk . fans of musicals may dig this  but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show .

=======================================================================================================

759 ===> i rented this flick for one reason tom savini  i respect his work but this was a real let down  i had horrible clichs  half of the film was naked women so called  fallen angels  running around trying to act scary  oh and then there was the occasional  blair witch  black and white motion sicken camera scenes . tom  s character was really awful  horrible script . and you got to love these lines they use .  is anyone there  who is out there  this isn  t funny  no but your acting was . i wish i could give this flick a   oh the names of the characters . judd  molly  ally  emilio  but they did leave out anthony  the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting .  

=======================================================================================================

760 ===> this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time . i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies  but this movie was a disappointment . the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures . when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them . he doesn  t really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents  and unless i missed something the didn  t say how he managed to escape either . . . not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience . it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the  cross incident  .  

=======================================================================================================

761 ===> emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel . i have not read the book so i really didn  t know that much about the plot  and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot . there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing . the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it . of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny . gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma . the film also stars toni collette  who has okay but has been much better  ewan mecgreger  who has also been better but he is still very good here  alan cumming  who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here  and jeremy northam  who  s performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle  even if that was not what it needed  there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching .  

=======================================================================================================

762 ===> a slight  charming little movie to be sure  but a superbly  crafted one . gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent  and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue . this came out around the time of sense and sensibility  and i  m sure i don  t know why that one garnered all the oscar attention . emma is jane austen  s most accessible and least stuffy story  told well .  

=======================================================================================================

763 ===> well this is a typical  straight to the toilet  slasher film .  br    br   long story short  a bunch of teenagers  young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons .  br    br   this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage  br    br    naked women   teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky   gory death scenes   the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff  but never bra less   a creepy  crazy man who knows about the evil   lesbian kiss scene   sex being a killer   no plot  br    br   even then for a cheesy slasher film  it was really terrible . the atmosphere is totally dead . nothing  not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity  was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested . watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold .  br    br   give the demonic . . . . .     .

764 ===> forest of the damned starts out as five young friends  brother  sister emilio  richard cambridge   ally  sophie holland  along with judd  daniel maclagan   molly  nicole petty   andrew  david hood   set off on a week long holiday  in the middle of nowhere   their words not mine . anyway  before they know it they  re deep in a forest  emilio clumsily runs over a woman  frances da costa   along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they  re travelling in won  t start  they can  t get any signals on their mobile phones . they need to find help quickly so molly  judd wander off in the hope of finding a house  as time goes by  darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone  that there is something nasty lurking in the woods . . .  br    br   this english production was written  directed by johannes roberts  having looked over several other comments  reviews both here on the imdb  across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it  other  s not  personally it didn  t do much for at all . the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with  additional screenplay material  whatever that means  the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre       with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest  kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction . then there  s stephen  played by the ever fantastic tom savini  who is never given any sort of justification for what he does . is he there to get victims for the angels  if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in  the story is very loose  it never felt like a proper film . the character  s are poor  the dialogue not much better  the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that  s going on . having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace  there are a couple of decent scenes here .  br    br   director johannes doesn  t do anything special  it  s not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at . there  s a few decent horror scenes  the tom savini character is great whenever he  s on screen  although why didn  t he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly    it  s a shame when he gets killed off . there are a couple of decent gore scenes here  someone has their head bashed in  there  s a decapitation  someone gets shotgun blasted  someone throat is bitten out  someones lips are bitten off  someone is ripped in half . there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity  not that it helps much .  br    br   technically forest of the damned is ok  it  s reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye  catching . this was shot in england  wales  it  s quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror . the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this . horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end  proves he should stick to writing rather than acting .  br    br   forest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film  it seems to have fans out there so maybe i  m missing something but it  s not a film i have much fondness for . apart from one or two decent moments there  s not much here to recommend .  

=======================================================================================================

765 ===> lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen  s satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial   th century england . northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other . good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material  which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism  . i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up  and i thought it didn  t rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the   s and   s do . very good results .

768 ===> i  ve seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie    but this movie was beyond terrible .  br    br   the acting was terrible  the plot was ridiculous  the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying . usually when i watch scary movies i think it  s dumb when the characters hears a noise in house  forest  school  etc and then yells out  hello is anyone there    but at least they  re believable when they do it . . this movie couldn  t even get that right .  br    br   this is a movie that  ll make other b  horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces .  br    br   i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who  s thinking of watching this movie will think again . it  s awful   

=======================================================================================================

769 ===> this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon . the  sisters  in law are female lawyers and judges who in     successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council . it is rather long   about two hours   but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges . it will leave you  as it left me  with many questions about exactly how this change occurred . how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon  have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses  was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court  against the express wishes of the husband  a one time event  i  m not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions . they made the movie two years ago  not yesterday . and the movie they made deserves a wide audience .

770 ===> i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well  this transposition is simply accurate  intelligent  delicate  careful  tactful  respectful  intense  in a word  perfect   br    br    emma  is one of austen  s most delightful and funny novels  thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters . the movie respected this subtle irony  not disregarding the comic element  miss bates above all  . what engaged me in the novel  and the movie renders it clearly  is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist  and the modern look with which women  men  and their relation are handled  and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the   th century  who lived almost a secluded life  could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me . we can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes  and use a more current language but the situations  the feelings  the ideas would be extremely modern . i think of the morbid interest in other people  s lives  or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women  s relations  and still the difficulty in revealing  and giving expression to one  s feelings  especially love every situation gets a universal and out  of  time value .  br    br   the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role  nowadays she would be probably too mature for it   toni colette is simply great . and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear  and then  the breathtaking english countryside  where every situation gets such a magic and dream  like dimension . . . a really enjoyable and deserving movie .

771 ===> angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens . talk about high concept . on the plus side this little mother gives us tom savini  but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen  time  his five minute presence seems a tad long . the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie  but though they might have the body of an angel  their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day . mediocre acting and amateurish gore  effects don  t help and the night scenes fatally recall paris hilton  s most famous movie . so bad that it is really bad .  

=======================================================================================================

772 ===> this movie is a terrible waste of time . although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to  . i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose . this is also a  horror  film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight . my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared .  br    br   the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries . it cannot be that high in demand .  br    br   the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie  half of the time she is british and half the time she is american .  

=======================================================================================================

773 ===> this is a good adaptation of austen  s novel . good  but not brilliant .  br    br   the cinematography is inventive  crossing at times the border to gimmickry  but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes  given that the entire story is dialogue  driven .  br    br   the acting is competent . ms paltrow is aloof  as her character requires  but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions . in other words  she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match  making endeavours . some of the supporting cast is guilty of over  acting  very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures . personally  i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton  to no fault of his own  except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley  dolly in  the high life  that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part . acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth  and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level .  

=======================================================================================================

774 ===> emma is a true romance . if you love the soppy stuff  charged with wit and folly  you will love this movie  its true to the novel  which is very important  with a few twists added for pleasure . gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades . she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to .  br    br   jeremy northam  as the hero . how shocked are you  i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck  what the right role can do for you  he looks so good as the sensible  regal mr . k  that i am literally looking at him in a new light . he makes and excellent romantic lead . the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful   br    br   ewan mcgregor  greta sacchi brings in the rest . a good cast . a good movie . if you are a fan of jane austen  see this movie  along with pride and prejudice  and most importantly  buy the books . it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary

775 ===> for the first forty minutes  empire really shapes itself up it appears to be a strong  confident  and relatively unknown gangster flick . at the time i didn  t know why  i thought it was good  but now i do .  br    br   one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful . i don  t mind films with psychos and things  to prove a point  take jackie brown  for example  but they  re all so terribly shallow in this  but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment . you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach . another major problem is the protagonist . he is smug  arrogant  yet  ironically enough  not that bad . he doesn  t seem tight enough to be a drug  dealing woman killer . the fact is  at the end of the day  this film is completely pretentious . not slick  not clever  just dull  and meaningless  this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs .  br    br    out of    out of    

=======================================================================================================

776 ===> i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre . it was actually sold out . i actually went to see solaris instead  which actually was the worst movie to be released in     .  br    br   victor rosa  john leguizamo   a tough  streetwise  street pharmacist   freaks out when he sees a kid get shot  so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack  peter sarsgaard  . things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish  denise richards  . this happened very late in the movie  so had they not revealed this in the preview  it might have been an interesting twist . but they did  so it  s not .  br    br   in fact  there  s not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview . if you saw even one preview  you saw the whole movie  so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps . go to the website  download the preview  save yourself   .   . there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film  other than how terrible the soundtrack is .  br    br   i hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired . twice . most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets  and  i may shatter the fabric of the space  time continuum with a concept as mind  numbing as this  they both had less talent and musical ability .  br    br   the acting is at best poor  the script is at best a crime against humanity  and denise richards is at best    styrofoam and    ziploc bag . you know things are bad when john leguizamo  he was in the pest   upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities .  

=======================================================================================================

777 ===> i have no idea how a texan  the director  douglas mcgrath  and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms . paltrow was in the first place  i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar  winning  shakespeare in love  performance but she gets all the beats right here   she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse . she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this .  br    br   of course  she  s surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette  greta scacchi  juliette stevenson et al . . . jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest  even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow  in the process  allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship   several years on  ewan  s hair is a little easier to take than it was in    and  personally  i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays . but the standout is  without a doubt  sophie thompson  sister of emma thompson  daughter of phyllida law  as miss bates what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates  as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn . the film is worth watching  again even  for her performance alone .  br    br   all in all  this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system . well worth a rental  because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again   but we  ll always have emma  .

778 ===> romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england  in this light  hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue  the ladies were charming and elegant  and the gentlemen dashing . emma   based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath  stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role . a self  appointed matchmaker  emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another . coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage  she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend  harriet  toni collette   but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying . meanwhile  her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr . knightley  jeremy northam   whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma  s  and lend some needed balance to the proceedings . and emma  so concerned with what is right for others  neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all her own . the world goes round and love abounds  but emma is about to miss the boat . luckily for her  however  the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings . now  if she can but stop long enough to realize it . but as everyone who has known true love knows  matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant  depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for emma  she must first recognize it  and seize the moment .  br    br   mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful  feel  good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world . there may be an air of frivolity about it  but in retrospect  this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is   in all honesty   to just about anyone love . and with mcgrath  s impeccable sense of pace and timing  it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable . it  s a pleasant  affecting film  with a wonderful cast  that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place . it  s light fare  but absorbing and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well  being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow .  br    br   the winsome paltrow  who won the oscar for best actress for shakespeare in love  two years after making this one  seems comfortable and right at home in this genre . she personifies all things british  and does it with such naturalness and facility that it  s the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether . she  s simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy . she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner  very reminiscent of audrey hepburn . yet paltrow is unique . as an actor  she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated   with such films as hard eight   hush  and a perfect murder    that she can play just about any part effectively  and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own . but it  s with characters like emma that she really shines . she is so expressive and open  and her personality is so engaging  that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch  regardless of the part she is playing . and for emma  she is absolutely perfect .  br    br   jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley  and like paltrow  seems suited to the genre   in the right role  that is his performance in the more recent the golden bowl   in which he played an italian prince  was less than satisfying . here  however  he is perfect he is handsome  and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real . like colin firth  s mr . darcy in the miniseries pride and prejudice   northam has created a memorable character with his own mr . knightley .  br    br   also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette  as emma  s friend harriet smith and alan cumming  as the reverend elton . respectively  collette and cumming create characters who are very real people  and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film . and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema  and to films of any genre .  br    br   the supporting cast includes greta scacchi  mrs . weston   denys hawthorne  mr . woodhouse   sophie thompson  miss bates   kathleen byron  mrs . goddard   phyllida law  mrs . bates   polly walker  jane fairfax  and ewan mcgregor  frank churchill  . an uplifting  elegant film  emma  is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness . and even if it  s only through the magic of the silver screen  it  s nice to be able to escape to such a world as this  if only for a couple of hours  as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit . and that  s the magic of the movies . i rate this one     .  br    br    br    br

779 ===> tedious girls  at  reform  school flick  which plays somewhat like a prison movie . chris  linda blair  is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father . once in the de facto jail  she is gang raped by her fellow female  inmates  .  br    br   overlong  even at   minutes   with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless .  br    br     year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed  but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene .  br    br       out of   

=======================================================================================================

780 ===> i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop  s . and this one surely is an oop . one year after the exorcist she  s back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out  she never became a mega star . that  s one of the reason  s many of her films are oop . she gives a good performance in this movie . it  s about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn  t have any friends . played at an age of   playing a girl of    that  s funny . the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity . in most editions it  s cut out  why  i don  t know  no blood is involved  okay  blair is butt naked but nothing is shown  no ta so nothing to offend people . but the movie is slow  extremely slow . it doesn  t happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep . it  s just about that   year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows  no gore no nothing . why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me . if you  re a fan of blair  buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is .

781 ===> i was so impressed with doug mcgrath  s film version of the jane austen novel  emma   and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much  that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re  united for  nicholas nickleby  i immediately rented it without any other consideration .  br    br   i have read the book  and for those overly  critical fans of this jane austen adaptation  i don  t know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen  s work  especially given the limitations of a two hour movie  which some have complained about being too long   . and as far as gwen paltrow  s accent is concerned  i must confess i wasn  t too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially  and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress   br    br   i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery . that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside . the film  s beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success . if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker  then perhaps you should rent something like  death wish iii    br    br   the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast  and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings . mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story .  br    br   this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex  violence or even a villainous antagonist . the story is often amusing  endearing  and at times  quite touching .  br    br   i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite .  

=======================================================================================================

782 ===> by no means my favourite austen novel  and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress  but i found the film almost totally delightful . paltrow does a good job  and cummings  stevenson and the one who plays  miss bates  are all absolutely terrific . the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right  in fact . but the real  find  is jeremy northam as mr knightley . there could not be more perfect casting  imo . i hated mr k in the novel  but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film . northam  s good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment  either  highly recommended . anar  

=======================================================================================================

783 ===>   st watched            out of    dir  walter lang   disappointing musical from a character development standpoint  in my opinion  from this much  heralded rodgers and hammerstein piece . there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal  at times  of the king of siam by yul brynner   but the movie doesn  t really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings . i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don  t fully understand the character  s and their situations . i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing  but even this part didn  t stand out a lot for me . the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things . we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil . there is a side forbidden romance between the king  s newest wife  played by rita moreno  a latino as an arab   come on    and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though . deborah kerr  as the main female character annie   is ok but not that convincing either . the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does . this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really .

784 ===> this review may have spoilers  but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well  known story  br    br   the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale . the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale .  br    br   the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale . this cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing .  br    br   this cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches or rather  is never transformed into a swan .  br    br   all the production value that money can buy  cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development  or good acting .  br    br   the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done  there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery .  br    br   the writing made me very nervous  too . the prince charming was the most undesirable of memory . why would any girl want to marry a boorish  self  absorbed prince who disliked women   br    br   turner  s turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one  liners more than acting nuance .  br    br   even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy .  br    br   perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt so cheaply     s   br    br   what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography  matte work and production design . it was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes  sets and settings as the story unfolded .  br    br   for some cinderella storytelling  go for two gems  br    br     rodgers and hammerstein  s cinderella musical with lesley ann warren . even with the obvious stagey tv     s look to the sets  this is the best version on celluloid  bar none . an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment . engaging  diverting and memorable writing and music . this is the classic .  br    br     ever after  this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective  alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale . the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well .

785 ===> what a delightful film . . .  br    br   accompanied by oscar  winning composer rachel portman  s lush  emotional and dreamy music  this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year .  br    br   incredible casting . . .  br    br   gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma . toni collette was great as harriett smith .  br    br   the character who stole the film was miss bates    she was mesmerizing to watch  one finds oneself on the edge of ones  seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her . one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages . from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr . woodhouse for sending  that lovely quarter  hind of pork . . . pork  mother     she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother  mrs . bates  played by emma thompson  s mother  phyllida law  who looks forlorn and lost .  br    br   the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut  wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart . we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one  s heart ripped out to her on her behalf . it is a classic scene  one to be rewound and played over  over . . .  br    br   the ending is right up there with  sense  sensibility  and provides one of life  s greatest lessons about how one should marry one  s best friend . . .  br    br   i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself .  br    br   i adored it

786 ===> i love this movie . my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film . we had no idea what it was going to be about  but it turned out spectacular .  thumbs up . i liked how the film was shot  and the actors were very funny . if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie . i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won  t . this movie is definitely on my top   list of good movies . do you really think nothing is bouncy   

=======================================================================================================

787 ===> this is a kind of genre thing  meaning you either like the     s musicals or you don  t . if you do  you  ll love this . personally  i prefer the     s and most of the    s musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers  and eleanor powell  bill robinson  ruby keeler  james cagney  shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the    s  the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off .  br    br   this film is a case  in  point . the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me . by then  the story didn  t have much appeal  either . the presence of deborah kerr is another minus . i don  t think i  ve seen a movie she starred in that i liked  including this one  where the goody two  shoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam .  i which she had   .  br    br   however  divorcing myself from likes  and  dislikes  there is no denying this rogers and hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks  particularly those who liked  the sound of music  a decade later . there are similarities in the rh musicals . thus  if you liked the julie andrews flick  you should like this  too .  br    br   this is a lavish production with  yes  a capital  l .  this is the kind of big  production musicals you rarely saw after that generation . you also get the dubbed singers  unlike today  where the actress isn  t able to really sing so marnie nixon comes to rescue of kerr  as she did with natalie wood in  west side story  and audrey hepburn in  my fair lady .   br    br   yul brynner is  king mongkut  and is the stereotypical traditionalist  the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way . he isn  t  progressive   as the left wingers like the say  but the education teacher  kerr  as  anna leonowens   will set him straight . secular  progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer  however  yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more  bark  than  bite character . justifiably  he is the big star of this film . brynner had magnetism . even in  the magnificent seven   yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience .  br    br   in summary  it  s a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it . i  ll leave it at that .

788 ===> madison is not too bad  if you like simplistic  non  offensive   family  friendly  fare and  more importantly  if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing . if  like me  you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson  muncey  cantrell  slovak  etc .  prepare to be disappointed .  br    br   professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports clich in the book . i needn  t repeat what they  ve said . what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the  glory years   which many would argue were already past in      .  br    br   yes  it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast  though it was clear that the restored versions  hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum  were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed . but where was the sound  much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind  numbing roar of six allison or rolls  merlin aircraft engines  wound up to rpm  s never imagined by their designers  hitting the starting line right in front of you . you didn  t hear it  you felt it . real hydro buffs know exactly what i  m talking about . there  s none of that in madison . instead  every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a  heroic  musical score .  br    br   and then there are the close  up shots of the drivers  riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines  in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home  town hero . or  in one particularly ridiculous shot  taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a  rocky  salute from a bridge pier . in reality  some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock  hard water at speeds above    mph .  br    br   as one reviewer so aptly put it   the sport deserves better than this .   br    br   finally  since another user brought up anachronisms  i  ll add one the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field . neither existed in      

=======================================================================================================

789 ===> i totally agree that  nothing  is a fantastic film  i  ve not laughed so much when watching a film for ages  and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this  they really work well together  this film may not appeal to some people  i can  t really say why without spoiling it   but each to their own  i loved it and highly recommend it   br    br   the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever . it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it   br    br   although there are really only main  characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch .  

=======================================================================================================

790 ===> whether it  s a good movie or not  films of this kind has to be made  i think . it remembers me of  i love huckabees   a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond  in a merry sadistic  masochist way         . i hope the director will go on stepping across the border  as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made  were not always subtle  some of the scenes were unhappily kind of  tarte    la  crme   like a childish slapstick   speaking about script and cinematography the color of  cube  was black   nothing  is white  more cheerful  surprisingly  than the former films of natali .  

=======================================================================================================

791 ===> perhaps it  s because i am so in love with the william holden  kim novak version  or because i  m not a gen  x  er  but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen . without the original  s soundtrack  it just seemed like another typical tv movie . . . yes  about as bland as kraft cheese .

793 ===> yes . . . i  m going with the    on this and here  s why . in the last few years  i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget . then i stumble upon  nothing  . looked interesting  wasn  t expecting much though . i was wrong . this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch . dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember  but not over complex to the point of missing the joke . i don  t want to remark on any of the actual scenes  because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once . with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies  you know  like killer military jets and  fresh  remakes that are ruining old classics   this movie will make you happy to say it  s ok to laugh at  nothing  .  

=======================================================================================================

794 ===> this movie was very funny  i couldn  t stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of  days  the movie is distinctively unique in it  s humor and visuals  both are terrific and on par with natali  s other  more serious  movie gems cube and cypher . i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything he  s made is very interesting .  br    br   very likable about this movie are the music and  loser  characters dave and andrew  portrayed by david hewlett and andrew miller  co  writer of the story   actors i both like very much . also cool are the x  box dead or alive fights  you even see dave playing halo at a point  and andrew  s amazing guitar solo  among many other things .  br    br   all in all a great feel  good film about friendship . you have to see this   

=======================================================================================================

795 ===> well  what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation   br    br   there are some amazing actors in this  oliver reed  sarah miles  christopher plummer  but they clearly are clocking up the money .  br    br   lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics  anthony with hugh grant  who looks suitably embarrassed  and gilbert with helena bonham carter .  br    br   if you really want to see a  watchable  adaptation of cartland  the bonham carter one is the one to go for   a hazard of hearts   what a title    . gilbert is the weak link in that  but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act  and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek  edward fox  diana rigg   

=======================================================================================================

796 ===> the first power       was a terrible film that came out during the late    s  early    s era of cheaply made horror films . i found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts . this movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain  t even funny . the swift justice system in this film makes texas look weak by comparison . lou diamond phillips is in way over his head with this role  he plays a hard  boiled cop  and tracey griffith  melanie  s more attractive sister  plays a psychic . don  t waste your time with this one because it  s bad . what a minute  i take it back . this movie makes a great party film . check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun  she has the nicest legs i  ve ever seen on a nun that wasn  t in a jesus franco nunsploitation flick . yeow   br    br   this marked an end of an era for l . d . p . his star was tarnished and he couldn  t draw flies to a dung heap . it was d . t . v . for him until his  ressurection  a few years later .  br    br   not recommended unless you  re desperate .  

=======================================================================================================

797 ===> this is a good movie  but it is not recommended if you don  t like intelligent movies . it  s about two guys that wish that the world would go away  and that  s exactly what they get . the acting is great  the ending was not predictable  and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days . people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring . i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger  i actually like b movies  or the grim adventures of billy and mandy . one note if you notice this  this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors . make it two notes wait after the credits  trust me on this one  . enjoy the movie .  

=======================================================================================================

798 ===> sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating  divorce  iranian style  which was as exactly as it stated  as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran . now they  ve turned their attention to the court system in cameroon  africa . what  s great about this court is that  of the magistrates are women  which is unusual for such a country like this . anyways  they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women  but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society  with divorce legal and women  s rights being recognized . so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times . not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment . one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt . the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury . and who said that justice isn  t served anymore  with these  behind the bench . they often carry out maximum penalties  ya  you go girl   

=======================================================================================================

799 ===> bizarre take on the cinderella tale . terribly poor script  but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step  mother performance .  br    br   visually stunning in some parts  but that  s about it . the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the     s . fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full   minutes of drivel .  br    br   if you  re really in the mood for a cinderella story  i suggest  ever after a cinderella story  or  the glass slipper  .  

=======================================================================================================

800 ===> patrick channing  jeff kober  is a disciple of satan  serial killer who possesses the  first power   even after being captured by detective russell logan  lou diamond phillips  and executed in the gas chamber  he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will . with the help of attractive psychic tess seaton  tracy griffith  melanie g .  s half  sister  he attempts to stop channing .  br    br   this concept probably had some possibilities  i think  but ultimately  the first power  suffers from routine scripting and film  making . this is nothing we haven  t seen before  sometimes done better . there is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers . more to the point  it  s not very thrilling and it certainly isn  t scary . phillips is a hard sell as a tough  as  nails  cynical cop stereotype  and griffith doesn  t seem to be trying very hard best cast member is probably the distinctively featured kober  doing his best to be supremely creepy .  br    br   the climax is rather silly and the ending very weak .  br    br   not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind  therefore  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

801 ===> i thought this was an awesome movie . the theme song is sweet    anyway  the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning  when everything should have been normal . it was very weird and unrealistic . the big cable company is mainly what i  m talking about . apart from that  the movie was very creative . i think that all the acting was well done  the actors acted out their characters  personalities perfectly . everything fit together well . it really is a shame that their isn  t a soundtrack . that would have been great  because this is a canadian film  and because it is one of my favorites  i give this movie a   out of     

=======================================================================================================

802 ===> tweaked a little bit   nothing  could be a children  s film . it  s a very clever concept  touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes  and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of . . . what goes against everything more than  literally   nothing   nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives . all that  s left is what they don  t hate  and a big empty white space . it  s hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film  especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot . it focuses on pretty much one subject  but that  s prime vincenzo natali territory . if you  ve seen  cube   you know already that he tends to like that type of situation . the  nothing  in this movie is apparently infinite space  but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic  if only because there  s literally nothing else  and nowhere else to go . the actors sell it  although you can tell these guys are friends anyway . two actors from  cube  return here  worth and kazan   but are entirely different characters . they change throughout the story  and while they  re not the strongest actors in the world  they  re at least believable .  br    br   the reason i say this could be a children  s film under the right tweaks  is because aside from a few f  bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence  the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids . so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore  especially considering there isn  t very much of it . this could  ve gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue . there is very little objectionable about this film  but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it . i only say that  s a shame because not because i support censorship  but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure .  br    br   at any rate  this is a reasonably entertaining film  albeit with a few dragged  out scenes . but for literally being about nothing  and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing  they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film .  

=======================================================================================================

803 ===> detective russell logan  lou diamond phillips  has a major problem on his hands . the serial killer  patrick channing  jeff kober   for whom psychic extraordinaire tess  tracy griffith  helped him capture  has been resurrected with the first power  . . given to him by satan after his execution in the gas chamber  and can possess the bodies of the weak . somehow  russell  who joins forces with tess  . . who has an understanding of what they are up against   will have to stop channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands . they will seek help from sister marguerite  elizabeth arlen  who has tried to inform her superiors in the catholic church of the first power  but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop channing . . a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of channing ridding the world of his evil . she  ll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to russell  who  ll need all the help he can get when channing kidnaps tess preparing her for some sort of satanic ritual  ceremony .  br    br   in the film  mykelti williamson  always a reliable welcome supporting actor  gets the partner of russell role . . so you know what will happen to him . as in films of this type  everyone around russell is dying  but when he attempts to kill channing  he  s merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses .  br    br   pure occult rubbish . . stupid from the gate to the finish line . phillips and griffith try  i  ll give them that  but in a flick like this they don  t stand a chance . kober  who is normally often always effective as the heavy  is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips .  

=======================================================================================================

804 ===> the only thing that the first power really has going for it is that it affords jeff kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that he  s done so well in the last   years . kober is a worthy successor to lyle bettger who specialized in those parts back in the fifties .  br    br   but it  s not enough  the first power is a souped up slasher flick that has lou diamond phillips wasted as an lapd detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers . kober is his latest catch  but kober  s in league with a lower power and they  re going to team up and make lou  s life miserable for him . even after kober is given the gas chamber  his spirit comes back in all kinds of guises .  br    br   mykelti williamson is on hand as lou  s partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and tracy griffith as a psychic and elizabeth arlen as a nun with insights are around to help lou . will he succeed in battling forces from beyond   br    br   by the time the film ends  you no longer care . lou really got trapped in a turkey . maybe the devil made him do this film .  

=======================================================================================================

805 ===> well   cube         vincenzo  s first movie  was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that i  ve ever seen when talking about movies . they had just one scenery  a bunch of actors and a plot . so  what made it so special were all the effective direction  great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth . his second movie   cypher         was all about its story  but it wasn  t so good as  cube  but here are the characters being tested like rats again .  br    br    nothing  is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his  cube days   locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room . but instead of a thriller sci  fi  even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that    nothing  is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we  re living . once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing .  actors and a blinding white scenario  that  s all you got most part of time and you don  t need more than that . while  cube  is a claustrophobic experience and  cypher  confusing   nothing  is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate .  br    br   this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget . of course that the movie fails sometimes  but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws . there  s nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since  cube  .  

=======================================================================================================

806 ===> having seen cube  i  ve been a fan of vincenzo natali  s work . natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline  and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster . instead  he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways  so much in fact  that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape  or in the case of nothing  a large empty expanse where there is . . . nothing  the advert had me hooked instantly . it seemed so simple  take two characters who no one likes  and send them to a world where there is nothing . natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist . in fact  the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film . there  s nothing there  but also  something  there .  br    br   it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading . i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so . therefore upon watching the film  i laughed every now and again  whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused .  br    br   if i may take a minute to give the film some praise  where the film excels on is the concept . it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing  and to put two characters there  not two brilliant minded characters  who will philosophise and work out their surroundings  but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are  another strong point is the film  s cinematography  though at first this may not seem it  where each wall  north  earth  south  west  up and down is just a white plane  a perception of depth becomes faulty . it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis  en  scene . the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens  but for the most part  the camera is placed so that two characters  or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background  allowing a sense of depth to be realised .  br    br   however  this film does lack in certain areas . the film is relatively short  but even so  after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull  and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot . we can also argue that the acting is once again  questionable . these two characters are in a sense  unlikeable  therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters . however  on a flip side of that  the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough  but there is something lacking .  br    br   even so  i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film  do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science  fiction horror film . it is much more of a comedy than that  it is indeed worth watching though  purely for the concept itself   

=======================================================================================================

807 ===> an annoying experience . improvised dialogue  handheld cameras for no effect  directionless plot  contrived romance  ick  to the whole mess . ron silver was the only real actor . gretta sacchi was terrible  henry jaglom did better with eating which suited his style much more .  

=======================================================================================================

808 ===>   br    br   i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program  and i thought it was awful  as i said in my tagline  it was pretentious  trite  petty and phenomenally self  important .  br    br   i consider myself a fan of film  and all the things that film has to offer . if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival  i will watch ae . . . . and they would probably be alot more objective about it .  br    br   i dont recommend it  period .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

809 ===> i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film  and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed . it made much of the fact that the film was  by the director of cube  and made it look like a horror film  when in fact it is an absurdist comedy  imdb  s spell checker doesn  t seem to think that absurdist is a word  but it is   reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead .  br    br   i love the way the story builds up slowly at first  then gradually escalates . i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film . that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube . i recommend it .  

=======================================================================================================

810 ===> director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character  based sci  fi flicks with his     short film  elevated   wherein  people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building . his follow  up feature project  cube   released later that year  had a very similar premise  this time with  people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps . both were admirable attempts to take the sci  fi genre a step further  by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation  choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element  how the characters act  react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions . after his exploration into the mainstream with      s  cypher   natali has come back to his bizarre character  film trend to bring us  nothing   his latest  and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of  what if    br    br   dave  david hewlett  and andrew  andrew miller  are life  long friends  brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with . dave  who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature  lives rent  free with andrew at his ill  located and ill  constructed house  where he often takes advantage of andrew  s neurotic and antisocial mentality . despite all this  the two misfits are happy together  until one day their deep character flaws  coupled with some astronomically bad luck  land them in the middle of some pretty serious  jail  sentence  worthy trouble . on top of this  they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset  so in the hazy  nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them  they wish that the whole world would just disappear . and it does .  br    br   going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film  s slow  occasionally too slow  reveal about what  s happened to dave and andrew  and how they deal with their new reality . natali  s fascination with studying human behavior under duress  ala the birds  is here in spades  but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers  he  s able to break away from the thriller  horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level . it  s almost as if he  s made the aphoristic opposite of  cube  .  br    br   of course  the film is not   minutes of laughter and sunshine . in keeping with fundamental realism  our two anti  heroes  dynamic often becomes antagonistic  sometimes with rather nasty results . like the  desert island  game  the film looks at how even best friends  when left alone together  can fall apart  but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence . in a very twisted  sci  fi way  this is a feel  good flick  with good heart and good intentions .  br    br   however  there are a few qualms to be had with  nothing  . while the two lead actors  hewlett and miller  do well with their parts  their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been  considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour . there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew  some background is given  but ultimately not enough . a generous viewer will sit through the less  engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end  but cynics will probably give up pretty fast .  br    br   acting  as mentioned  is adequate  and considering the amount of  green  screen  work that would  ve been needed  reasonably convincing . david hewlett and andrew miller  who both wrote co  wrote the screenplay  have been long  time friends of vincenzo natali hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made . perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction . nonetheless  the story could have been a lot more involving . granted  it is relatively entertaining considering that  no pun intended  nothing really happens  but you get the impression that  in more experienced hands  a lot more could  ve been done with this premise .  br    br   in all fairness   nothing  is an impressive piece of work in many ways . the concept is interesting  the direction is inventive  the script works on a human level and  most of all  it shows a progression in natali  s creative mentality . for fans of his work  this will be a delight  and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time . it  s just a shame that the director  s fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great  fun film it could have been .  

=======================================================================================================

811 ===> awful  awful  awful  no  i didn  t like it . it was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the wheeling and dealing of the  movers and shakers  who produce a film . in some cases  these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are . i didn  t need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are . i suppose i  m at fault really because i expected something like  roman holiday  .  br    br   i  m not a movie  maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of  two  shots   in the main  where the actors    had been supplied with a loose plot  line and they were to improvise the dialogue . henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors  cognisant of the general direction of the film  extemporised the dialogue  and it was not always successful . such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didn  t flow along the line of the conversation  and i  m not going back to look for it   and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation  because silver  s remark was such a non sequitur . you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to  wrong foot  the other actor and break his  her concentration . another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to  bring the  documents    times  . silver looked literally lost for words . i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too   br    br   the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi  no stranger to australia   ron silver  anouk ami  and maximilian schell suggests it was a  slow news week  for them . peter bogdanovich had a  what  the  hell  am  i  doing  here  look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say  look  i  m a director and screenwriter  not an actor   which would have been unnecessary to state  faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son  liam . apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue  the hand  held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude  as i suspect the  natural  dialogue was  and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot . that at least approached cinema verite . so that  along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button  made for a generally disappointing    odd minutes .  br    br   i think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this . trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided . there was really nothing avant  garde about it . it didn  t come across as a work of art and yet it wasn  t a documentary either . i know  it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining . i was bored out of my skull  it did have one redeeming feature it pronounced  cannes  correctly so i gave it     .  

=======================================================================================================

812 ===> movie industry is tricky business  because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life  too . that  s the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an  insightful  film about film . and indeed  no better proof of the industry  s trickiness than seeing anouk aime and maximilian schell trapped in this inanity . the insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like  should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self    do the latter  please .  or  our relationship is not only professional  it  s private as well . it  s a rather complex situation to handle  isn  t it    yes  it is  my dear .  between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees  hotel lobbies and american movie posters  no sign of non  american film presence on the croisette  . recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable  making the    minutes of the film feel like ages . jenny gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame .  

=======================================================================================================

813 ===> if you want mindless action  hot chicks and a post  apocalyptic view of seattle  then this is the show for you   br    br   the concept of dark angel isn  t anything new  in fact  there  s controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book   but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish .  br    br   jessica alba is smoking and max  friends  original cindy  kendra  are just as hot .  br    br   the fight scenes are getting better  but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better  the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it  .  br    br   in my opinion  dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for  but if you  re looking for hard hitting  award  winning drama  go watch  the west wing  or something .  

=======================================================================================================

814 ===> i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk . well actually  it doesn  t  because this film is everything a hollywood film isn  t  original  creative  quirky and humorous . it seems that today no  one really wants to see this type of movie as  in the simplest terms  it doesn  t conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film .  br    br   i haven  t written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention  even if it is during my   minute break between classes  essentially  it is about nothing  as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world . the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise  en  scene consists of half a house and a vast white  empty space . this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors  both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles .  br    br   i  d love to write some more but am on quite a time limit . however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try . a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well  executed fashion  with the combination of good performances  a strong script  nice sound design and  fairly  impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie .  br    br   it  s just a shame so few people know about nothing . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

815 ===> after being a big fan of the ten minute t . v episodes of  stella street   i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation . unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed .  br    br   i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t . v episodes  and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing  as if the actors had said them once  and couldn  t be bothered to say them again . i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again .  br    br   spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street  a normal english street in surrey   gradually being populated by  some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years   including michael caine  al pacino  jack nicholson and the rolling stones . all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster  and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people . there are some nice moments  but on the whole  the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring . end of spoilers  br    br   in the t . v episodes  all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell  including females   but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast . i think this was a mistake . her impersonations weren  t funny  and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do .  br    br   if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street  you may find this film entertaining . but if you were a fan  i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated .

816 ===> apparently  the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self  mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood . i use the word  apparently  because without listening to a director andy copp  s commentary  which i didn  t have available to me  or reading up on the film prior to watching  viewers won  t have a clue what it is about .  br    br   gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real  life footage  but unless they  re also fond of pretentious  headache  inducing  experimental art  house cinema  they  ll find this one a real chore to sit through .  br    br     minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis  chordant sound  terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue  this mind  numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one  s sanity if you  ve still got all your marbles  you  ll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead  i watched the whole thing  but am well aware that i  m completely barking   .

817 ===> nothing is fantastic  simple as that  it  s a film that shouldn  t work  yet does . natali stays in the realm of sci  fi  however this film is also a comedy . cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali  at   .  million  woo  hoo pa   so with nothing he scales down again . this is low budget  independent film  making at it  s best . simple  good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood  s usual reasons for mostly financial gain . nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask  no it is not anything like seinfeld  basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers . they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways . andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out . dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with . by bizarre mis  fortunes however  dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work  place incriminating dave  and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout  canadian humour people   . as it turns out andrew  s house is to be demolished as well and he can  t stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on . both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling . they are desperate and can  t escape  and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white . what has happened  have dave and andrew died  they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet . no police  no demolition team  no angry girl scout mother  what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to  wish or hate away .  as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world . they are left alone . the house is surrounded by nothing  which is portrayed as pure white . so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white . the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water  they begin to tire of each other . they discover they can hate away hunger  which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say . i can  t reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold .  br    br   this film is quirky  funny  interesting . the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube  david hewlett  and andrew millar to lead the film . they have chemistry and also work very well . they have to hold    of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background  yet it works . certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states . nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers .  br    br   natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature . i prey to god he doesn  t do the proposed necropolis  written and directed by add sufferer  the ever crap paul anderson . vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad  run    run like the wind   i hope and prey this guy doesn  t take to hollywood like alex proyas did  with the enjoyable yet pussy  footed  sugar coated  helium light i robot   . keep your eyes peeled for this guy .

818 ===>  . . . than this    what would happen if terry gilliam and douglas adams would have worked together on one movie  this movie starts with a touch of brazil . . . when  at a certain point  the story moves straight into the twilight zone . . . bringing up nothing new  but just nothing . . . and nothing is great fun  when dave and andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable . . . bouncing heads  well . . . yes     br    br   anyway . . . this movie was  imho  the biggest surprise at this year  s fantasyfilmfest . . .  br    br   just like in cube and cypher natali gave this one a minimalistic  weird but very special design  which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time . . . timeless somehow . . .

819 ===> i bought this movie for  euro  not knowing what it was all about . i thought  hmmm  a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore  . it wasn  t funny alright . it was disturbing . very disturbing . and i don  t mind disturbing movies but this one just didn  t mean anything  except that child abuse is not a good thing to do . hmmm . . . the quality of the images were terrible . the acting . . . there was no acting . just some fcked  up fcker mutilating himself for over   minutes . this is probably material for sicko  s jurking off on extreme gore .  br    br   don  t watch this . it  s not worth your time . its just awful . i wish i never bought this .  br    br   they should mutilate the guy who made this

820 ===> an avent  garde nightmarish  extremely low  budget  film  that has delusions of grandeur . hard to sit through . i get the message that child abuse is wrong . wow big revelation . i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this . yes that  s sarcasm . don  t watch this  film  if you  re offended by nudity of either the male or female gender . don  t watch it if you  re the least bit squeamish . don  t watch it if you care about acting . on second thought just don  t watch it period .  br    br   my grade d   br    br   dvd extrasmaking the movie  the premiere  interview with kristie bowersock  deleted scenes  movie stills  director  s commentary   versions of the teaser trailer  music video by the azoic   a classroom video experiment  

=======================================================================================================

821 ===> the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now . we  ve all heard or read about it in some kind of con  text . what would you do if you were all alone in the world  what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes  in fact  the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew  two room  mates living in a run  down house in the middle of a freeway system . andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society . that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along  because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed . just until . . .  br    br   straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them . both of them get involved with crime  andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn  t dare going out of the house . dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues don  t treat him very well and with the respect he deserves . the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it . this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away . . . and of course that is exactly what happens .  br    br   the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness . at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment  but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left .  br    br   nothing features an incredibly small cast  in fact  besides the first couple of shots from the film  we only see dave  david hewlett  and andrew  andrew miller  in the entire film . it is clear that in order to pull this off  the cast has to be more than up for the task  because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way . vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close  up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well . director of photography  derek rogers  also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information  especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it  but we don  t see it right away .  br    br   obviously  this can  t be an event driven film and it  s not . much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void . and that  s where some of the most hilarious scenes take place  especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar .  br    br   now  one could be thinking  how does nothing look like   well  it looks like nothing indeed . the entire world of nothing is white . . . white no matter in what direction you look . this is the weakness of this film . . . after an hour or less it  s getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it  s more interesting to look at . thank god  there are some . for example at times when the two lads  due to the properties of nothing  are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of . . . tofu  as andrew claims  . it  s fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society .  br    br   one of the best parts of the film is the set . . . production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film  the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at  still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this . all in all  the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching . . .  br    br   however  the very best part of the film is the acting . both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are . the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said  there are just about no props in the film  they are really on a bare stage . with plenty of character development and some decent one  liners  clever dialogue  at times hilariously stupid   it all works to that end  and this really moves the movie away from the low  budget area to well  crafted handwork .  br    br   let  s talk a little about the visual effects  because they are definitely worth mentioning . nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film . there  s a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film  and although the drews have milked that scene completely it  s still fun to watch . one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment  they have the abilities to wish everything away  so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear   br    br    nothing  is a bright and well  lit movie  it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead  this is in fact one of their theories   but  nothing  is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory . we don  t know where they are or what has happened to them . we don  t know if they will ever get out  because the movie ends before we see anything like that . the ending  by the way  is not as good as it could  ve been . it  s rather easy to predict what is going to happen  still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end  it  s a reasonably satisfactory one .  br    br   take  hollow man    kill bill    cube    epoch  and lots of other films and you have  nothing  . it really is an amalgam of different styles  still there is no other film  at least that i know of  nothing is really like . for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube . he talks about him and andr bijelic having been room  mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out   nothing  could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story  and to that end  it  s almost like one of the cube prequels .  br    br   what can i say  i enjoyed  nothing   it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well  made with tons of intelligent ideas  still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is . . . maybe if we have a  nothing   i can answer that question .  nothing  is a great film  but not as good as i expected it to be .  br    br   final rating  .      

=======================================================================================================

822 ===> i wasn  t sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this . a smart  slightly twisted comedy that makes you think . i wasn  t quite sure how a director can create  nothing   but leave it to mr . natali and the brilliant individuals at c . o . r . e . to create another low budget set that looks real  as real as nothing can be  . well worth your time and money  if you have the opportunity to see this  please go . you  ll be glad you did .  

=======================================================================================================

823 ===> this is a good example of how not to make a film .  br    br   there is very little meaningful dialog  no context for the events  and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes . the result is a confused  clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director  s commentary .  br    br   this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is  with an emphasis on child abuse . it includes some stock footage of real  horrible acts of violence  including war time executions . although it works in the context of the movie  i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content . this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended  and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors .  br    br   the climax is anti  climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie . if you  re not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it .  br    br   the director  s commentary was a one  shot   sit the guy down and let him talk  no cuts  type of commentary . while this isn  t necessarily bad  the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college  filming conditions  co producers  bad film  and a dozen other things . the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie .  br    br   the movie was shot many years ago on   mm and super  film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget . because of this  the video and audio quality is poor . that alone does not make it a bad movie  but it does make a bad movie worse .  

=======================================================================================================

824 ===> it  s a hideous little production  apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches . it  s an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop  motion animation . it  s weird  but it  s not the kind of fun  weird trip anyone optimistic might expect . it  s the cold  inhuman  unfriendly  sickening  even creepy kind of weird . there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie . after all  disney did a fantastic job with the same source material . and cosgrove  hall did far more attractive things with stop  motion .  br    br   interestingly  this is a french production . as such  it re  enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary .  

=======================================================================================================

825 ===>   br    br   charlie kauffman has made weird metaphysical angst popular  but this canadian gem makes it hilarious .  br    br   like most weird films the less said about plot the better but let  s set the scene  two friends anthony and dave have been together since childhood  they can  t cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to . but that is where even more problems begin .  br    br   i loved this film  it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of  nothing  out there .  br    br   don  t miss this .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

826 ===> i haven  t written a review on imdb for the longest time  however  i felt myself compelled to write this  when looking up this movie i found one particular review which urged people not to see this film . do not pay any attention to this ignorant person  nothing is a fantastic film  full of laughs and above all . . . imagination  aren  t you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubble  gum trash movies  sometimes a film like nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before . i don  t even care if you dislike  even hate  the movie  but no one has a right to discredit the film . imdb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that . just say you hate it and why you hate it . . . but don  t try to tell people that they shouldn  t watch it . we have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank you .  br    br   if my judgment is any good  i  d say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it .  br    br   treat your mind to a bit of eye  candy  see nothing   

=======================================================================================================

827 ===>   i don  t understand . none of this makes any sense    exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder . having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie  i know exactly how he feels . the story  by the film  s director aristide massacessi  good old joe d  amato using his real name for a change   is a clumsy mix of the supernatural  murder  mystery  and pretentious arty rubbish  the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy   s garbage such as jess franco  s more bizarre efforts  but which had me struggling to remain conscious .  br    br   opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister  with whom he had been having an incestuous affair  before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor   death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman  played by ewa aulin  who stars in the equally strange  death laid an egg   is seen alive and kicking  the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbrck . after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home  where she is tended to by creepy dr . sturges  klaus kinski in a throwaway role   the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr . and mrs . ravensbrck  meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin   .  br    br    so far  so good   i thought to myself at this point   we  ve had hunchbacks  incest  some blood and guts  and gratuitous female nudity  all ingredients of a great trashy euro  horror what follows  however  is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings  ghostly goings on  and even elements from edgar allan poe  s  the black cat   to tell a very silly  utterly bewildering  and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave .  br    br   this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb  but given the choice  i would much rather watch one of the director  s sleazier movies from later in his career i guess incomprehensible  meandering  surreal   s gothic horror just ain  t my thing   .  out of    purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness   rounded up to  for imdb .  

=======================================================================================================

828 ===> spoiler warning  br    br   first of all i rated this movie  out of   .  br    br   the idea is good  but there are too many stupid errors in the movie  failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been . first of all she never fights alone . after an initial very strange doubt from her mother  which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie  the rape victim is not alone .  br    br   she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew  s strange traps .  br    br   her friends are unbelievably nasty .  br    br   the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon . ethan is very much the leader of the crew  hey  they even say so  and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk  but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn  t manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong . everyone just simply hates him . . . why   the movie provides no explanation . how did he ever become the leader   br    br   a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in . two actors from the same successful tv  series . . . . a cheap way to get viewers

829 ===> jimmy cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage  producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming  talking  movies .  br    br   this story of love  deceit  women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment . the direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done . the story never really got lost in this frantic pace .  br    br   some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn  t matter because when you look at this in a     time  frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time .  br    br   jimmy cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film  never loosing his composure as the ever  working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros . in this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business  he was a broadway producer before he started this . joan blondell is fabulous as the neglected love  interest  nan  she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time  so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change .  br    br   the only problem i had with the film were the enormous productions at the end . these were magnificent in itself  beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced  but they just didn  t seem to fit in the story . the only link they have to the main story is that cagney had to put on  previews in  days to get a contract and that  s what he did . i had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater . in this way the  sitting on a backyard fence  was much more appropriate to the story .  br    br   the productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing . i was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then i realized there were another two coming up . these sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well .  br    br   all in all a great film with a sour ending .  br    br

830 ===>      footlight parade        released           viewed       .  br    br   the ice cream cone is invented in new york .  br    br   kevin after a long and busy break  we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros . this time it  s the ultra  fast paced footlight parade  starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent . i am     certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent  who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute . joan blondell is also excellent as the acid  tongued secretary  turned  love interest . the ruby keeler  dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable . one thing that baffled me was berkeley  s performances themselves  which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage  let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards . obviously busby doesn  t let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over  the  top musical numbers he can possibly conjure . i liked nearly all of this movie until the end  with the shamelessly offensive number  shanghai lil   which  as one can guess  is about as stomach  turning as racially distasteful performances come .  br    br   doug six movies in three months . got to be a new record . anywaythis completes warner bros .  musical trilogy of      preceded by    nd street  and  gold diggers of     .  i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row . i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie  or if that the role as written was inspired by busby . i hope it was it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does . the funny thing about cagney was that he didn  t really look like a leading man in the traditional sense . he was      square  headed  and talked with an odd new york accent . but the guy was quite versatile  going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast  talking producer  types we see here . and he could dance . basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor . the rest of the cast has some familiar faces joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagney  s loyal and lusting secretary dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple  but seem to get less screen time than before billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp . the movie is typical of the more racy and adult  oriented musicals of the pre  code era  as opposed to those of the    s and    s that were more family oriented  and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year  the  shanghai lil  number not withstanding  with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese  .  br    br   last film dinner at eight       . next film i  m no angel       .

831 ===> i saw this movie in its own time period  when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life  but stamped your child as a bastard . in these days of  single mothers  that may seem very far  fetched  but it was very true . and i  m not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering  either . between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny . at that time i didn  t know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had . i did know who betty hutton was  and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic . i loved  bringing up baby   but i find this movie just embarrassing . i  m sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked  but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again . the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to  get married  and get pregnant just added to the misery . an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances  so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part . of course  shoot me  i don  t like  it  s a wonderful life  either .  

=======================================================================================================

832 ===> this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget . dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid  chase scenes are uniformly boring  and most of the on  screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film  s last five minutes  a briefly glimpsed port  a  potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film  s chief villain   no prop is here without a purpose  . the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman  s studio when he  d give a first time director a few bucks and a camera   but without the discipline corman would impose .  

=======================================================================================================

833 ===> wow . . . what . . . a whirlwind . the    s is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine  especially during the early talkies phase . there were movies which are painfully static and dull  like  dracula  with bella lugosi  and there were those that just don  t give it a rest  sometimes in a good way and other times not . this is one of the films that don  t stop for a minute  and that is both a wonder and a pity . lloyd bacon  who also directed    nd street   must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema  for he filled this picture with it . there mustn  t be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking . it  s completely crazy  i was thinking the movie deserved a   or a   tops  because the pacing was very poor  since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn  t know what was happening and what to think . the characters seemed to just running to and fro places  talking about things which didn  t interest me and probably no one else . i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache . i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in    nd street   ruby keeler  and    nd street  was a movie whose ending was the best part of it . and you know what  it happened the same thing with  footlight parade   the ending is absolutely incredible  it has become  hands down  the most impressive musical i have ever seen . the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are  believe me  something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth . the numbers are flawless  there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one . suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work  beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache .

834 ===> the wit and pace and three show stopping busby berkley numbers put this ahead of the over  rated   nd street . this is the definitive    s musical with a knockout frenetic performance from jimmy cagney . one of the last releases before the motion picture production code was strictly enforced . a must see .

835 ===> the real shame of  the gathering  is not in the bad acting  nor is it in the despicably shallow plot . the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun  even though it did have one main attraction takashima . i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova  even for just five minutes . she has that sarcasm  that wit  that double  edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable . sadly  though  the  babylon   pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination . patricia tallman   who never seriously returned to the series until much later   fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander  who here is little more than a whiny  tiresome telepath . i shall leave you with one final thought   why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outer  space frog man  even though she is a woman   thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show .  

=======================================================================================================

836 ===> you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget  but the movie is still sub  par . dont get me wrong  b  the series is by far the best tv series ever  but if i was an exec seeing this movie  i wouldnt have ordered the series . i dont like o  hare as an actor  the costumes are silly  and there are tons of cliches . the same can be said for most of the first season  with the exception of babylon squared and survivors   bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle . if you are a b  fan and havent seen this movie  see it . if you arent a b  fan  dont . . . you wont want to watch the series .  

=======================================================================================================

837 ===> never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely dick powell   scott blair  who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler   bea thorn  . james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater  s during the      s . chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows . this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs . joan blondell   nan prescott  gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty . dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career . enjoy .  

=======================================================================================================

838 ===> a wonder . one of the best musicals ever . the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular  but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non  stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell .  keeler is also lovely  even though she may not have been a great actress  . there  s a freshness in the movie that you don  t see in flicks today  much less in the usually stilted   s films  even though the plot  involving the setting up of movies prologues  is quite dated .  

=======================================================================================================

839 ===> i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part . since i am a filmmaker  i give it a  for consistency .  br    br   the problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most  if not all  previous successful war stories . the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story . i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with  but did not find that information .  br    br   it seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged . the actors weren  t bad  but the plot needs more innovation .  

=======================================================================================================

840 ===> wow . i have seen some really bad movies in my time  but this one truly takes the cake . it  s the worst movie i  ve seen in the past decade  no exaggeration .  br    br   as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan  i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film  not because it brought back memories  far from it  but because there was absolutely no attempt at  authenticity  to be found anywhere in the film . not so much as the tiniest little shred . it seemed like it had been written by an  year  old child who got all his notions of war  and soldierly behavior  straight out of comic books . the film was made in honduras  which should have been a clue  but even that can  t fully explain the atrocious production values of this clich  ridden piece of trash .  br    br   i could try to list all the endless technical flaws  but it would take virtually forever . from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii  and the character  s name tags  like  colcollins   worn by the character  colonel collins    which was actually spelled using the reversed  mirror  image  n  of the russian alphabet  not the us alphabet  the list just goes on and on . the uniforms  the equipment  the plot  and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves   every single scene was just chock  full of ridiculous flaws  inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichs .  br    br   neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable . it was all laughably childish  in the extreme . this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre  pubescent boys  and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd .  br    br   in short  this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all . it  s a total waste of time . i  d strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by it  s truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for .  

=======================================================================================================

841 ===> clever  gritty  witty  fast  paced  sexy  extravagant  sleazy  erotic  heartfelt and corny  footlight parade is a first  class entertainment  what the movies are all about .  br    br   the realistic  satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking . to think that they only started making feature talking pictures  years before this  the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today  especially considering that  realism  has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema .  br    br   this film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh  self  referential  critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age . i  d recommend watching any film from this period  that is           for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be .  

=======================================================================================================

842 ===> how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me . i loved this show before i even saw it . for  reasons   . the story intrigued me   . jessica alba and  . james cameron  please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that it  s bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season  as well as season  on dvd and then join the campaign to get season  made   br    br   i hate fox and i  m sure a lot of you  dark angel  fans hate them too . they have a thing for canning good shows  don  t you all agree   

=======================================================================================================

843 ===> diana guzman is an angry young woman . surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas  she takes her anger out on the closest targets .  br    br   when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club  she knows she  s found her home .  br    br   the film progresses from there  as diana learns the usual coming  of  age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing . michelle rodriguez is very good in the role  particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism .  br    br   the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors  who pale in comparison to the older  more experienced cast . there are too many pauses in the script  which detracts from the dramatic tension . the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity .  br    br   this is a good picture to see once  if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power . its limitations prevent it from being placed in the  see it again and again  category .  

=======================================================================================================

844 ===> dont let the mpaa fool you with their  rated r for extreme violence  there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of st . i expected some cheap rambo  type action that the trailer promised  however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense . avoid   

=======================================================================================================

845 ===> james cagney is best known for his tough characters  and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot  soft  characters in his career . this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in .  br    br   cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing . and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it . he plays the role with a lot of confidence . he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time  so it actually isn  t a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career . he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in .  br    br   the movie is directed by lloyd bacon  who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre . his earliest     s musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as    nd street  . his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really .     s musicals never were really about its singing  this was something that more featured in     s and later made musicals  mainly from the mgm studios .  br    br   as usual it has a light and simple story  set in the musical world  that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way . it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch . so do the characters and actors that are portraying them . sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie  when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines .  br    br   the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done  even though i  m not a too big fan of the genre itself . once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty . he often played little boys  babies  mice and whatever more early on in his career  including the movie musical  gold diggers of       of one year earlier .  br    br   a recommendable early genre movie .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

846 ===> i have a feeling that the warners bros depression  era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years . yes  we are in the economic doldrums  or have you been living under a rock  and times look bleak . but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles . in the    s  film  going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom .  footlight parade        was one such film that audiences flocked to . while this lloyd bacon  directed musical doesn  t quite capture the social issues of the time as  gold diggers of            does  it  s still a wonderful showcase of talent . we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers  but boy  are they worth waiting for me . yes  little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress  and her tapping is so  so  but busby  s magical  by a waterfall  whisks her  and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls  into a dizzying water wonderland . of course busby  s numbers could never really be performed on a stage  they defy limits of gravity  for one thing   and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough  wisecracking non  musical scenes . and  footlight  also has james cagney in at the one of his all  too  few musicals  really  what couldn  t this man do   . he even gets to take over from the leading man  don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil  who is really little ruby in china  girl wig   . he co  stars with joan blondell  his adorable  adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women  until the final reel  that is  . apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife . and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene .  

=======================================================================================================

847 ===> slight spoilers  br    br   a hunchback    year  old boy kisses a very cute    year  old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time . after the act  he lays in the bed with her not touching her . the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years .  br    br   this is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality  or perhaps a medical drama about a post  pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency .  br    br   however  as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a    year  old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother .  br    br   at one point  his mother preaches to her co  workers who are not as understanding as they might be   every step of the way in this  my son has been amazing . . . i have never been more proud of him . . .   br    br   the young father  s older sister  who otherwise is cold towards her brother  begins to show pride in her sibling   you have been cool about this   as she gives him an encouraging warm hug .  br    br   the    year  old father wants to be a father . he wants to be a parent .  br    br   why not  we see the  new  baby a few minutes after birth   it appears to be a healthy  happy   month  old infant . just as babies were born on tv in the      s and      s .  br    br   once the young father is a parent  he has found happiness . he insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper . we see the    year  old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen  s busybody mother is peaking over his shoulder . fade to black .  

=======================================================================================================

848 ===> i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school . as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new . though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through . it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn  t live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original . we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him  we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust  then we have the father who is always gone . then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does . on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling . everything about this fell into clich the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl  they get together  have sex and then boom we have a little kid . perhaps it could  ve been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i  ve seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that  s pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted . so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie i  ve seen was juno . so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message . like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity . i really hope someone decides to either re  make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential .  

=======================================================================================================

849 ===> this is a wonderful film . the non  stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate . the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated . i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts . joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together . some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today  s movies . put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is .  

=======================================================================================================

850 ===> fast  paced  funny  sexy  and spectacular . cagney is always terrific . blondel charms you with her wit and energy . it  s obvious that this is a pre  censorship film by the innuendo in the script  the costumes  and the way they touch each other . and bikinis before there were bikinis  this is no holds barred fun for everyone . i don  t understand the john garfield issue though . does it matter whether or not he  s in this film  if he is  he screen is so short that he  s basically a prop . you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he  s there . i  m a big cagney fan  but had never seen this one before . i found it on turner classics . i found it by wonderful accident . sit back and enjoy the ride   

=======================================================================================================

851 ===> honestly  the concept behind  masters of horror  had something going for it . big  time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again  i was all for it from the start . that is  until i watched some episodes . . . oh boy  it  s really bad tv . not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits  but there seems to be guidelines as well  like shooting in hd for example . to make a long story short  it  s bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons . i cannot help but compare to the  tales from the crypt   and the m . o . h . episodes really don  t stand the comparison . tftc was good  moh is bad according to me here are a few keys to explain it tftc was shorter  around   minutes for each episode  than moh    minutes per episode   i believe it allowed denser screenplays  with good ideas reoccurring more often  better overview of an episode  less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring . duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on tftc directors got to have real film music composers  composers on moh are if inexistent  very bad   real actors  whereas on moh it  s nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor    real directors of photography and  it can help sometimes  real film cameras  while moh is shot on hd cameras with very wrongly chosen lens  pieces   the result of which being that the episodes of tftc looked and felt  cinematographic  in the sense that there was real actors being casted  ranging from michael j . fox to tim roth to kyle mclachlan to kirk douglas  but there were also film composers behind it  of the range of alan silvestri  great directors of photography like dean cundey  high  end screenplay writers  and in that sense each  tale  was a little movie of its own true kind . compared to tftc  the  masters of horrors  is quite a lame approach to tv horror . it  s very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average  because it looks the same as any ugly tv serial  if not worse . it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast  within the first   minutes usually . the actors are never  heard before wannabes  except for fairuza balk  robert englund  angela bettis and a few  but even there  they are the only famous actors of their episodes  . the director base for moh was good in the beginning  but it  s getting worst and worst with every episode now if even the directors are unknown to the world  what remains  nothing  and it  s funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they haven  t even had  say  stan winston  dick maas  william lustig  sam raimi  eric red  robert harmon  william friedkin  jim muro  stuart gordon  russell mulcahy . . . if even  masters of horror  cannot bring dead directors back to life  who will  maybe a rerun of tales from the crypt will .  

=======================================================================================================

852 ===> i was very excited when this series premiered in     . the premise was very simple and appealing each episode would be a one  hour mini movie directed by a famous  noteworthy horror director . then  when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown . some good episodes emerged from that first season  but all in all it was a mixed bag . i attributed it to the learning curve  and figured that season  would be a whole lot better .  br    br   boy  was i in for a shock . at least season one had a few good stories here and there . season   with the exception of  the black cat  starring the excellent jeffrey combs  was a complete and total loss to me . the episode  sounds like  may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last   years  and most of the other episodes aren  t much better . i really hope that season  turns this around next year  but i  m not holding my breath .  

=======================================================================================================

853 ===> of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film . from that point of view it is utter fantasy . but who cares  it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane  battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching . films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes . it is about what cinema does best great camera  work  great settings and great performances .  br    br   the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented  keeping the best till last .  br    br   i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and . . .  

=======================================================================================================

854 ===>   footlight parade  is just one of several wonderfully jaunty musicals that warner bros . produced in the early      s to ward off the depression .    nd street  and the golddiggers series were also produced during this era  and they made literally  millions of americans forget their troubles for a little while  and enjoy themselves .  br    br   while most of the films produced had the great talents of joan blondell  ruby keeler  and dick powell  only foolight parade had the incomparable james cagney . almost ten years prior to his most well  known musical   yankee doodle dandy  . here he dances in that most original of dance styles  with his arms usually lowered at his side  and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks . it  s easy to see that he is enjoying himself  and that makes us enjoy him all the more .  br    br   while almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film  they are well worth the wait . i believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code  so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risqu . but it  s all in fun .  br    br   it doesn  t matter what the plot of the film is  just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast . besides those already mentioned  guy kibbee is at his flustered best here .  br    br    out of    

=======================================================================================================

855 ===> horror fans  i  m speaking to the over    s  although if you  re under   i apologise for what you might deem an insult   in short  if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written  original storytelling  punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares  and delivered via convincing performances  then i can heartily recommend  avoiding these steamers  made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date . it  s no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the      s . not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys  or indeed the    s  because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of argento  carpenter  landis  dante and barker  actually clive  wtf are you doing in there   glad to see romero had the good sense to give it a miss as i  m sure he was asked to partake . . .  . more perhaps we should point the finger at creator mick garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill  advised tv remake of stanley kubrick  s masterpiece  the shining  .  br    br   perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today . are we so starved of good tv horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets  sadly  maybe so .  br    br   normally i wouldn  t see the point of adding a comment that doesn  t argue the faults and merits of a production  i  d just rate it accordingly . however  as this series is woefully lacking in any merit  with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune  i write this as more of a warning than a review don  t waste your time and money . if you disagree with me then it  s more than likely that you haven  t seen enough decent horror . perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start  but if these  masters  of horror were being assessed on these works alone  they  d never have been allowed to graduate with even their bachelor  s degree . unless of course they were studying for a degree from the university of st .  

=======================================================================================================

856 ===> according to imdb takashi miike  s master of horror  segment  imprint  was banned in the us . so i figured i  d translate the swedish review i just wrote for it . . .  br    br   it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer  director takashi miike  s episode in the masters of horror series . and the dvd  cover of imprint did in deed look very promising .  br    br   the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello  some time during the   th century  and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo  the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for . tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello  hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey . it turns out that one of the prostitutes  a deformed and quiet girl  know about komomo  and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left . the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow . . .  br    br   the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american  english . but i will leave it at that  it  s not that big a deal . what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was . miike  s tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn  t help looking at my watch several times during the   minutes . the extended torure  scene  that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie  felt so unmotivated  and pornographically intrusive  that not even that scene became interesting . i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself  with no sense of style or purpose . the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water . . . and  in all honesty  the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust .  br    br   the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago  for me most memorable as frank nitti  al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables       . i  ve always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy  and i mean that in a good way   and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible  not in a good way  in this one . his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting . when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa  twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago . i  m grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh  memoirs of a geisha        who plays the deformed prostitute .  br    br   the finale is probably supposed to be chocking  maybe even revolting and horrid  but i just found it to be kind of . . . you know . . .  blah   and i looked at my watch again  for the umptieth time  just wishing the crappy episode would end  . maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit  but that  s only because i couldn  t help thinking of an episode of red dwarf  and the upside  down chins of craig charles and danny john  jules  with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens . . . lucky you  if you  ve seen that episode and now decide to see imprint  i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you .  br    br   my first thought  when imprint finally ended  was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it  was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur  the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series   and that  if anything  is a big friggin warning  don  t you think   br    br   one might point to the costume design  by michiko kitamura  and say that there  at least  is something not lacking in style and refinement . . . but there are so many other films and tv  shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese  geisha  fashion  . this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed . takashi miike  s masters of horror  episode is boring  uninspiring and pointless . in other words it  s really  really bad   

=======================================================================================================

857 ===> i thought this had the right blend of character  plot  futuristic stuff and special effects without going over board . it will take a while to get going  but the acting was good and i was intrigued by the angel who is not to hard to look at . i like the attitude too  certainly not like other attempts at futuristic stories .  

=======================================================================================================

858 ===> this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together   cents to see it and forget the gloomy day  to  day economic conditions during the    s . remember    cents bought a loaf of bread back then  so this was a minor luxury for many people . it  s testimony to how hollywood did its best to make the usa feel a little better about itself . you  ll note that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type  cast in similar movies  e . g . james cagney  william powell  ruby keeler  frank mchugh  joan blondell and guy kibbee . then too  branches of the u . s . military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer  busby berkeley  at the end .  

=======================================================================================================

859 ===> i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap . i had wanted to see it for ages  finding the plot outline very intriguing . so my disappointment was great  to say the least . i thought the lead actor was very flat . this kind of part required a performance like johny depp  s in the ninth gate  of which this is almost a complete rip  off   but i guess tv budgets don  t always stretch to this kind of acting ability .  br    br   i also the thought the direction was confused and dull  serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn  t done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness . as for the story  well  i was disappointed there as well  there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess  but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor  and the way he finally got the film anti  climactic to say the least .  br    br   this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn  and you can tell he does love his cinema  but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise .  br    br   i took the dvd back to the store the same day   

=======================================================================================================

860 ===> there was not one original idea in this story . themes were pulled from various sources a few being the ninth gate  in the mouth of madness  another carpenter film   and the ring . it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the film  s namesake . the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria . hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around . yes  i saw that the theater was playing argento  s deep red . claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop  out . this was bottom  of  the  barrel . throwing gore and  disturbing  imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film . carpenter used to know that . he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine .

861 ===> it has singing . it has drama . it has comedy . it has a story . it  s one of the greatest movies ever made . . . period . if you can  t enjoy this movie  then you must be either asleep or in some kind of mental disarray . in  yankee doodle dandy  james cagney sings and dances his way to an academy award but in this movie he is better  this is james cagney at his quisessential best  he  s fast with the one  liners  he  s fast with his feet  it  s nonstop action . and the song  and  dance skits are classics  especially  shanghai lil .  and the supporting cast is great and the entire movie is upbeat  fast moving  and exudes confidence . and even though this movie was made over   years ago  it  s still watchable  even today . and of course  this movie features miss ruby keeler  who was married to al jolson  . she is the perfect partner for james cagney . . . and dick powell too  if you like upbeat  fast paced movies  with lots of singing and dancing  this is the movie to watch .

862 ===> the stock market crash of     and the depression following almost ruined the american musical theater  in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville . those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front .  br    br   in an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy  out of work theater director james cagney comes up with a brilliant idea . stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters . some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on .  br    br   footlight parade is my favorite busby berkeley film . it gives james cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy . in his retirement cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot  he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films . he wished he  d done a few more musicals in his career and i wish he had .  br    br   of course the staging of these busby berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason . but it  s so creative and fun to watch .  br    br   dick powell gets to sing three songs in footlight parade  ah the moon is here  honeymoon hotel  and by a waterfall  the last two with ruby keeler further cementing that screen team . ruby sings and dances with powell in the last two and she partners with james cagney in my favorite number from footlight parade  shanghai lil .  br    br   joan blondell is cagney  s no nonsense girl friday at the theater . like in blonde crazy  she  s the one with the real brains in that duo and it  s her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones . one of blondell  s best screen roles .  br    br   look for dorothy lamour and ann sothern in the chorus as per the imdb pages for both of them . john garfield is seen briefly in the shanghai lil number . and in a scene at the beginning of the film  producer guy kibbee takes cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a b western starring john wayne . the duke  s voice is unmistakable . but what  s even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with frank mchugh who plays another cagney assistant in footlight parade . i think the brothers warner were playing a little joke there . i  ve got to believe that clip was deliberate .  br    br   footlight parade is busby berkeley at his surreal best .  

=======================================================================================================

863 ===> i  m sorry to say this  but the acting in this film is horrible . the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever . perhaps i got the  dress rehearsal  version by mistake . the director over  uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves . the story is pretty well written  and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films . the fights seem pretty real . but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point  blank automatic weapon fire  grenades  morter rounds  and bazookas . the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen  especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about   yards  and every bazooka shot is wide by at least   feet . those bazookas need serious site calibration .  

=======================================================================================================

864 ===> the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic . everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out . i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn . i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene jim watch your ass nick you watch yours  together   i wont leave you behind   br    br   the first action sequence shows how awful the production is  but its really kind of funny good guys have transformer weapons  in one scene  they all have fake hk mp  sub  machine guns . next scene  ak    replicas  and then  to top it all off  they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of m    s   i think they had a budget shortage for guns  not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys . fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell . you have to remove the pin  spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own . you can  t fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter . weapons that you throw away don  t suddenly re  appear . when a gun is out of bullets  throwing it away is still pretty stupid . unless you have no idea how to reload them . . big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes . i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced . this movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk .  

=======================================================================================================

865 ===> footlight parade is among the best of the      s musical comedy extravaganzas . a snappy script and an all  star cast including jimmy cagney  the lovely joan blondell  dick powell  and ruby keeler make this film a cut above the rest . directed and choreographed by the creative genius busby berkeley  this film will have you grinning from ear  to  ear from start to finish .  br    br   busby  of course  is the undisputed master of the hollywood musical with  gold diggers of      and    nd street  to his credit  as dance director  . footlight parade is graced by hundreds of scantily  clad chorus girls  a berkeley trademark . the elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and busby was the first director to film close  ups of the dancers . his obsession with shapely legs and  rear  view  shots is amply demonstrated here . the overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing .  br    br   our boy jimmy cagney plays chester kent  a producer of  prologues  or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown . he  s surrounded by crooked partners  a corporate spy  and a gold  digging girlfriend . although cagney had a solid background in vaudeville  this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents . joan blondell is memorable as cagney  s wise  cracking  lovestruck secretary . and ruby keeler is adorable  as always .  br    br   the film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers   honeymoon hotel    the waterfall   and  shanghai lil   each one a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in today  s hollywood where so  called  special effects  have replaced creative cinematography .  br    br   claudia  s bottom line clever and erotic  with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid . a thoroughly enjoyable depression era romp .

866 ===> a very early oliver stone  associate   produced film  and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman  co  founder and president of the world  s only real independent film studio troma  creator of the toxic avenger and  at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival  lifetime  achievement awarded filmmaker for over   years  . having raised the money for this film on his own  lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in     and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself . but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore . indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd  s version of his own script  as one of the world  s most original  daring  experimental and non  compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has . but as it is we have the gershuni  directed film . and weather it is due to the strong script  or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own  sugar cookies is a very intelligent  highly suspenseful and well  crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives . the shoestring budget the small studio  this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over   years now  michael herz  formed troma  had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive  indeed does not have a  low budget  look at all . the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone  played by enigmatic mary woronow  and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i won  t reveal not to spoil a delightful story . this leads to a succession of plot  twists  mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock  s vertigo and at least as inventive . the atmosphere is a lot grimmer  though  and some comparisons to nicholas roeg  s and donald cammell  s performance come to mind . in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end  which  along with a splendidly interwoven sub  plot with a nod to kaufman  s earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what  s the fuss  makes for a very exciting one  and  a  half  hour . certainly one of the best films in troma  s library  and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste . the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry  later seen in george romero  s the crazies   thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult  favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself . highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

867 ===> this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline . the problem is  frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l . paul bremer in to tell his side of the story . more troubling is the fact that the director of the film  charles ferguson   a former think tank wonk  was a war supporter until the occupation went south . what did he think would happen   br    br   the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis . and that is what this film feels like   an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself .  br    br   ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better   as if any war can be better .  

=======================================================================================================

868 ===> there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology  which is extremely flawed . it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis  which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe .  br    br   journalism     tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable . for instance  the idea of civil war  chaos  looting  etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following hussein  s demise were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture  doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself  rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure  would they rather the us have declared marshall law  i  m sure the papers here would  ve exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force .  br    br   aside from the analytical idiocy of the film  it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming  so  and  so refused to be interviewed . . .  yet the questions they would  ve asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received . would you  as vice president  deign to be interviewed by a first time writer  producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words . they couldn  t roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions  perhaps they never watched her hearing .  br    br   this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there . this is another biased  asinine approach by journalists  which are  by and large  unthinking herds .  br    br   anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary . these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think .

869 ===> starting off  here  s a synopsis porno queen alta lee  lynn lowry  is murdered by her pornographer lover max  george shannon  in a game of sexual russian roulette . alta  s other lover  icy lesbian casting agent camila stone  mary woronov   provides an alibi for max . but camila has an agenda of her own  and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress julie  lynn again  in a web of sexual mind games . when the lookalikes  identities are sufficiently blurred  the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter .  br    br   though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention  i find it to be a sexy  suspenseful gem . cult goddess woronov has one of her best  ever roles  and she and sexy  innocent lowry play off each other well . the unsettling music provided by gershon kingsley  plus two original songs   all  american boy    you say you  ve never let me down   and the jaynetts   sally  go  round the roses  compose a memorable soundtrack . theodore gershuny  s direction is sharp  with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under society  s upper crust . with tons of great new york atmosphere  ondine  woronov  s friend and fellow warholite  giving a great performance in a small role  and exotic monique van vooren as max  s ex  wife in a comic sub  plot . this sub  plot  though amusing  looks like it belongs in another movie altogether . however  i  m not complaining  as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic  thriller garbage currently being cranked out .  br    br   trivia sugar cookies was originally rated x  soft  core  and released by general film corporation in     . i am the proud owner of an original one  sheet poster   lucky me  in      the movie was cut for an r and re  released by troma team  which now offers it uncut on videotape . mary woronov was the wife of theodore gershuny at the time  and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera . she can also be seen in two of his earlier productions  kemek       and silent night  bloody night       .  

=======================================================================================================

870 ===> i enjoyed longstreet  which followed in the steps of raymond burr  s successful ironside tv series and was intended to give it competition . but this show was canceled after one season because it was decided   i believe wrongly   that longstreet was not able to compete with mr . burr  s ironside .  br    br   i may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable . i hope that a box set of longstreet will appear .  br    br   writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on tv .  

=======================================================================================================

871 ===> universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made . no  that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner . however  perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return .  br    br   this film is a sci  fi  action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it . the acting is as bad as any movie i  ve ever seen . the plot is terrible and predictable . the special effects are pathetic . in short  anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves . us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces . some movies are so bad  they  re good . believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them . i  m really not sure what else to say here . i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn  t already  but just in case don  t .  

=======================================================================================================

872 ===> no fireworks despite violent action .  br    br   science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed  largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention  and unfortunately for its producers  this work is lacking on both counts  woefully so in the case of the latter . with essentially no budget with which to operate  it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and  in particular  special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish  while seeds from the scriptors  imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found . among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment  and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly  but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility . the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth  with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first  timer paolo mazzucato  whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

873 ===> this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didn  t find an audience .  br    br   the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story . and who could forget pax  the beautiful guide dog in the series   br    br   whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series  the settings  in new orleans  the acting and the music  i note the comment about the music score in other comments . . . i remember that clearly  all work to make a good television series even better   br    br   well you never know . . . one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd   

=======================================================================================================

874 ===> there is no denying that ealing comedies are good  but for me this film stands out as one of the best .  br    br   the basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy  not the uk . we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes  and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law  rationing does not exist . when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system .  br    br   they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right . in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started  that  s where the moral comes in . it  s when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender  only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food  lot  s of it . thus enabling them to continue their struggle .  br    br   this film hit  s the right note throughout  the acting is superb  with stanley holloway  margaret rutherford  hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out . it  s pitched just right  not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat . well worth a viewing  

=======================================================================================================

875 ===> we open with colonel luc deveraux  van damme   the original universal soldier and his buxom asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers . they almost kill the two  then oh wait  it was just a field test . deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers . why he would want to be involved in this  if you know anything about the original  is never explained and well beyond me .  br    br   it  s after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going . the united states government has cut the universal soldier  s project budget and in the process angered seth  the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the universal soldiers  . naturally he won  t be shut down without a fight . so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out . which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel  but that doesn  t stop it from becoming stupid as hell .  br    br   for instance  one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg . seems you can  t go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie . he  s big  he  s tough  right  wrong . van damme doesn  t seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him . . . once . . . twice . . . three times . the point here lost on me . then there  s the breaking of glass . a rudimentary part of any action movie  but someone involved must have a glass fetish . you have to see the fight scenes in particular . let  s not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips . then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck  they have seth  the computer  secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black  michael jai white  . nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem . potentially offensive and just downright lame . he  s no replacement for dolph  either .  br    br   universal soldier  is a lousy sequel . it  s loud  it  s dumb and it doesn  t care . the original wasn  t anything poetic  but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level . the sequel doesn  t . they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence . so give credit where credit is due .  

=======================================================================================================

876 ===> i first heard of unisol  when i drove past a cinema when i was on holiday in america . i really did not take much notice of it until i bought the original on dvd which led me to find out about its three sequels . i subsequently started to read about the return on the imdb and asked friends what they thought of it . despite their horrific criticisms of it  i still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until i saw it for hire on dvd . i wasn  t expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the us  after all  how often is it that you see van damme on the big screen  well  nothing could have prepared me for this . it is so bad i almost cried . what a total waste of   minutes and   .   . it is hard to explain how bad this move is . honestly . this is idiotic film making . no  it  s more than idiotic . i just cannot believe how this got made . i cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered mic rogers . how stupid can people possibly be  firstly  van damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good . secondly  the fact that xander berkley  of terminator  and air force one status  commited himself to this film . i simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie . it takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof . here is an example jcvd  s daughter  yes  luc is now a human again    i want my daddy   seth   so do i  . oh yeah  and some guy tries to shut down seth by pulling three huge levers with  wait for it  on and off written on them . the acting all round is like playschool acting . i  m sure mr director modelled luc  s reporter girlfriend on april o  neil from the cartoon teenage mutant hero turtles  she refuses to go because she  . . . needs her story  . i mean come on  how many cliches can a film possibly use  please listen to me fellow imdb users  don  t touch this with a barge pole . to conclude  universal soldier the return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie . in fact  if they weren  t called unisols then you would never know it was a sequel . luc is now a human again  what the hell    the only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub . all the new uni sols look like they were dragged off the street  they are that unconvincing . this is pure torture to watch  so do yourself a favour  don  t torture yourself . p . s  best part of the movie romeo jumps off a building and shouts  oh sht  .

877 ===> my cable tv has what  s called the arts channel  which is a  catch  as  catch  can  situation sometimes  sometimes films  sometimes short clips of films or ballets  and i came into this just as the bar scene came on  where they tear up their coupons . excellent  exquisite  ealing wins again  my wartime  glasgow  raised mother would love this  should i ever find a copy of it . some of britain  s best artists  from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford  having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office . loved the last scene  where as soon as they are  back in england   the temperature plummets and it rains . . .  

=======================================================================================================

878 ===> passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema . not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy  but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age  with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life .  br    br   stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton  who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb  discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the   th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last    years .  br    br   accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england  which has never been officially rescinded  to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil  which means that in the eyes of international law  pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it  s own right and a law unto itself .  br    br   this sets the war  battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction  so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books  destroy and ignore their clothing coupons  flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc  declaring themselves fully independent from britain .  br    br   however  what then happens is ever spiv  black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the  border  into burgundy as a refuge from the law and post  war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods  and half of london  s consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration  making their quiet happy little haven  a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that .  br    br   appealing to whitehall for assistance  they are told that due to developments this is  now a matter of foreign policy  which his majesty  s government is reluctant to become involved  which leaves the residents high and dry . they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road  mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlico .  br    br   eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege  with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food  but never the less fighting on in true british style . as one bugundian resident quotes   we  re english and we always were english  and it  s just because we are english  we are fighting so hard to be bugundians   br    br   a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them  by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades .  br    br   will whitehall  who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it  s knees by this new batch of foreigners  especially as these ones are english      br    br   great tale  and great fun throughout . not to be missed .  

=======================================================================================================

879 ===> i was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film . i didn  t enjoy the first one at all  and the last jean claude van damme film i liked was blood sports  after managing to sit through it all  avoid  avoid  avoid    

=======================================================================================================

880 ===> i  m sorry for jean  after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career . this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg  romeo  and whatever that computers name was . also  some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary . truly  bad movie .  

=======================================================================================================

881 ===> every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state . i do not think this is the point of the film at all . the film parodies the spivs  small time criminals who ran the blackmarket  and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation .  br    br   yes of course the film sends up the political  social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society  they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign .  br    br   but i don  t think they go back to being exactly like they were before .  

=======================================================================================================

882 ===> i commend pictures that try something different . many films just seem like re  treads of old ideas  so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico .  br    br   the movie is set just after ww  and the post  war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners  barmy  . the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico . they  too  are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it . that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago  with this document  they reason  they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want  since it turns out they really aren  t british subjects  where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you  ll need to see for yourselves . leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem   

=======================================================================================================

883 ===> this movie was absolutly awful . i can  t think of one thing good about it . the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them . the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed  and that is saying alot    and dialogue  what dialogue    to think that i was a fan of the first one  i use that comment loosely  its more like a guilty pleasure  than anything else  . this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud     nothing good can come of this movie . what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can  t even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of    this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time .     because it is soo hard for me to give a  .  

=======================================================================================================

884 ===> this is a piece of s   t   this looks worse than a made for t . v . movie . and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results . . . war is prettier than this . jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now . no script  no story and no time should be wasted on this . i mean that .  out of   is too high  way too high . goldberg should be jackhammered for this . van shame is no actor .

885 ===> spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence . in an early episode of cartoon  family guy  the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there . way back in     however  the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea .  br    br   after a child  s prank  the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure . at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy . withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain  the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state .  br    br   based at a time when rationing was still in operation  this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring . featuring performances by stanley holloway  betty warren  philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey  the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation . these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines . feeling remarkably fresh  despite being over   years old  the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained .  br    br   ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence . with films like  passport to pimlico  it  s not difficult to see why . amusing from start to finish  the story is always fun and always worth watching .

886 ===> i love this show  it  s sure to be a winner . jessica alba does a great job  it  s about time we have a kick  ass girl who  s not the cutesy type . the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots . everything is layed out well  and thought over . to put it together must have taken a while  because it wasn  t someone in a hurry that just slapped something together . it  s a great show altogether .

887 ===> i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it . the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony . they fly to the moon in a space  age dustbin carrier when there  they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase .  br    br   it strikes me that rubbish low  budget sci  fi films often involve either desert planets or  like this movie  criminals escaping from penal colonies . why this is i have no idea . but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical . this one is really no exception . it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half  way alright dance music soundtrack . it then degenerates into a boring sci  fi thriller . so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review  so if you  re reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film  s subtleties and nuances . for the record  i recall a tedious bunch of baddies  a tedious bunch of goodies  some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman . other than that  i  m struggling .  br    br   if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film . i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets .

888 ===> there  s tons of good  looking women in this flick . but alas  this movie is nudity  free . grrrrrrrrrr strike one .  br    br   ahem . one story in this film takes place in     . then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage  hello  continuity  anyone   br    br   as you might know  this movie was released in stereoscopic  d . and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen . i  m not sure if someone botched the job on this  but there was no  d  just double  vision blurs . i didn  t have the same problem with this company  s other  d movies  hunting season and camp blood . sure  the  d in those ones sucked too  but with them i could see a semblance of  d effect .  br    br   this thing is a big ball of nothing .  br    br   and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear  eating dame  yum  i  d like to see more of her . in movies  as well . looks like janet margolin at a young age . purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  br    br

889 ===> this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london who  through an unusual set of circumstances  discover they are not english  but are an annex of the french province of burgundy .  br    br   the film features comic actor stanley holloway  best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady   as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period .  br    br   the story was apparently based on a news item at the time  when the canadian government  officially  gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of royalty . the idea actually reminded me of the real  life case of the hutt river province in western australia  where a landowner  seceded  from the australian government due to a wool quota dispute .  it was never acknowledged by the western australian or australian governments  .  br    br   this is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues  rather like the tv show  yes minister   as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well .  

=======================================================================================================

890 ===> this very funny british comedy shows what might happen if a section of london  in this case pimlico  were to declare itself independent from the rest of the uk and its laws  taxes  post  war restrictions . merry mayhem is what would happen .  br    br   the explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that pimlico was ceded to the duchy of burgundy centuries ago  a small historical footnote long since forgotten . to the new burgundians  however  this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please  free from any interference from whitehall .  br    br   stanley holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world  s tiniest nations . dame margaret rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with pimlico . others in the stand  out cast include hermione baddeley  paul duplis  naughton wayne  basil radford  sir michael hordern .  br    br   welcome to burgundy

891 ===> this is the official sequel to the    sci  fi action thriller . in the original  van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets revived to be the perfect soldiers  unisols  . in this one  it  s  i guess  about a dozen years later  since van damme has a daughter about that age . now he  s working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest unisols  codenamed unisol      for some reason . as usual  something goes wrong the on  site super  computer  named seth  like the snake in  king cobra  the same year  goes power  crazy  takes command of the unisols  and even downloads its computer brain into a new super  unisol body  jai white  . we  re lookin  at the next step in evolution  folks  most of van damme  s fights are with one particularly mean unisol  pro wrestler goldberg  who just keeps on comin   drop him off a building  no good run him down with a truck  no go  shoot him  burn him  forgetaboutit  much of the humor is traced to how van damme is now outmoded and out  classed  he  s even going grey around the edges  . but  though he takes a lickin   he keeps on kickin   most sequels of this sort are pretty lame  pale imitations of the originals  and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius  it manages to be consistently entertaining  especially if you  re a pro  wrestling fan .  

=======================================================================================================

892 ===> this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean  claud vam damme stars in this movie . there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie .  br    br   the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the  actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all . and this movie by far has to be one of jean  claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport  kickboxer or sudden death .  br    br   over all this movie is crap  ok and my rating is  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

893 ===> i get tired of my  and  year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon  disney and the like . it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again . when my daughters couldn  t go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick  i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while . i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different  i flipped the channels . my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harvey  s voice . i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice  over work for a little duck . . . well  i couldn  t change the channel  my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together  the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed . it  s not necessarily a proponent for  gay rights  but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything . i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another . . . . too fat  too skinny  too feminine  being a bully  not being smart enough  only having one parent . . . . you name it  kids  as a rule  can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience . my girls already accept others as they are and don  t pick on others for being different . my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they  re picked on  one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often   it warms my heart when kassie stands up for her   .  br    br   so  those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that it  s an advocate for  gay rights  or are being forced to  accept certain views   you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon .  br    br   and if you need it explained to you . . . . well  you need more help than any television show could ever offer .  

=======================================================================================================

894 ===> henry thomas showed a restraint  even when the third act turned into horrible hollywood resolution that could  ve killed this movie  that kept the dignity of a redemption story and as for pure creepiness  sniffing babies   

=======================================================================================================

895 ===> this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world . i  m pretty sure it was double team  which convinced everyone that jean  claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks . however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever . while universal soldierthe return isn  t as dull as double team or the quest  it  s still pretty awful indeed  with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing . this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling . as i look back  not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud . in other words another clunker in van damme  s assembly line .  br    br    out of   bad   

=======================================================================================================

896 ===> this was an atrocious waste of my time . no plot . the acting was so far below par  it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do . it is merely a commercial rip  off of the earlier universal soldier  which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel . its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years  and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it . this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name . by comparison  it makes segall  norris  and arnold look almost talented .  br    br   perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send  ups of his genre . at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him .  

=======================================================================================================

897 ===> i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable . it is a quiet  little film that doesn  t overwhelm you with special effects or  big  performances . it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina .  br    br   henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker  a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods . toker  s search for the baby  s parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life . david srathairn plays truman lester  a slimy conman with an ulterior motive . and david plays the bad guy to perfection .  br    br   there is much more to this film than first meets the eye . filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music  it is worth watching .  

=======================================================================================================

898 ===> henry thomas was  great  . his character held my attention . i was so  into  the story that i forgot it wasn  t real . i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was . the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character . the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring . i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head  in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself .  

=======================================================================================================

899 ===> jean claude van damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of universal soldier . but  did that movie saved him  i think he goes to hell  after he dies .  br    br   in the first minute  we see the inside of a facility  where you can see the bad guy of the film . scary  huh  but not as scary as the acting  details are following  .  br    br   then  we see van damme with a black girl  do not remember the name . . . . well it doesn  t matter anyway   trying to escape from some muscle  men . of course they are the new universal  soldiers . more muscels  less brain  just like the movie  . after a while  van damme fights goldberg but then the  mission  gets aborted . it was just a test  is this movie a test for our nerves   . it turns out that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project  who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing  that yould van dammes character could do  . but it is a sequel . and a  story  has to come up . ah  i forgot . he has a daughter . very important for the  story  .  br    br   well  after about   minutes  a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project . of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone . van damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers hunting him  it wants van damme as a soldier  because he is the best  really    . and guess what  goldberg is one of the hunters  who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked . funny  yes  just like the rest of the film .  br    br   after some  story   van damme tries to rescue his daughter  of his wife  the reporter in the first movie  . it comes to a final show down where van damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie  please see for yourself . it is just too funny to tell  .  br    br   you  ll see that this movie is a waste of time .  br    br   so do not watch it . but if you do  keep a sixpack with you   

=======================================================================================================

900 ===> i don  t think any movie of van damme  s will ever beat universal soldier but u never know . this movie was good but not as good as  st . vd returns a luc  must do battle again . he tries  b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle . vd has a kid this time from ally w .  good it showed a pic of them  . goldberg was cool  he does his famous move  forgot what its called cause i don  t watch wrestling  sucks . vd  goldberg had some good fights . it was the ending like the  st but just not that good . vd does his best move in his career  like always  the helicopter kick . even though  the final ending should  ve been longer . anyway  it is worth seeing but it will never top the original .  

=======================================================================================================

901 ===> i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary . what i love most about it is that it is understated and low  key  but deeply heartfelt . henry thomas   he played the child in e . t .  performance is masterfully inarticulate  he is supposed to be a man of few words  . david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain . and miraculously  given that we  re talking about a hollywood product here  a baby serves as a main character  but one who doesn  t act or have lines  but rather just is   is luminous at that  . interesting to note that thomas  mysterious relationship w . e . t . was the core of that film while his bond w . the baby serves as the core of  a good baby .   br    br   then there is the music   ah  what music   gillian welch  s tunes are wonderful  the entire score is gorgeous hill country music .  br    br   this film is wonderfully atmospheric . i recommend it highly .  

=======================================================================================================

902 ===> dark angel is a cross between huxley  s brave new world and percy  s love in the ruins   portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order  both in the worst sense of the word . once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by  the pulse   it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters   max  the dark angel  bike messenger  and logan  the rich rebel  . it seems uneven  perhaps a result of a variety of authors  but is held together by the energetic  beautiful  and charming jessica alba  who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive . i think that fox has done it again .  

=======================================================================================================

903 ===> ok  so it was written in      before      so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world  is prescient . that  s it . that  s the good stuff . the acting . . . fair . the plot . . . silly . the  twist  . . . unnecessary . dooooooooooom it isn  t as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated . don  t you think bureaucrats have a manual for  plagues  and how to contain them  proper execution of such a plan is always a problem  as we saw after katrina . but they have a plan . it isn  t to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania . and if the virus is carried in the air  why was the plane door open and the  shooters  standing there with no protection  in fact  did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs  that would stop her . but not as dramatic . i  m a sucker . i always watch a movie to see the end  once i started it . but this was a waste of time  and for the most part  predictable . i saw it using a recorder so i didn  t have to watch all the ads  that was a plus . it  s a good example of why i watch so little network tv . rubbish .  

=======================================================================================================

904 ===> the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel . since the real star  dolph lundgren  would not be able to reprise his role from the original  there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write  off . bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white . to their credit  they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement . bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film  and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role . for once  his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times  and it does not get irritating . the problem from the audience  s point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films . and therein lies the problem . you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action . you go because you want comedy  however unintentional .  br    br   unbeknownst to many people  universal soldier was followed by two direct  to  video sequels . i have only seen the first  which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke . matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career  the sight of jean  claude van damme comes as a welcome relief . the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct  to  video sequels  and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original . after years of investigation and explanation  the unisol project is still going ahead  with some minor modifications . for one  the new unisols are stronger and more damage  resistant than their earlier cousins . for another  all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth . in the early parts of the film  seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome .  br    br   being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes  we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut . the unisol project is on the chopping block  which essentially means that seth will be turned off . seth  somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained  decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down . his only problem is that every so often  a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown . two individuals possess the code in question . seth kills the first in short order  and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme  s films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be . the rest of the film revolves around the unisols  attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly . a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film  but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting .  br    br   the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichs . when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white  we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over . he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity  s weakness  es  . gee  seth  you mean they will not be our strong points  all kidding aside  the short length of the film is both the film  s weakness and its strength . it leaves the action without adequate setup . in the original  we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols  how they work  and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film . here  the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate . at least in the original  a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice . here  one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform  and presumably his body   getting up every time without stopping for breath .  br    br   i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner . if you can see it on the cheap  knock yourself out . this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre .  

=======================================================================================================

905 ===> what another reviewer called lack of character development  i call understatement . the movie didn  t bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory . yes  there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of  but this was primarily a one  day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters  lives . henry thomas  s performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action . good rental .  

=======================================================================================================

906 ===> it  s cheesy  it  s creepy  it  s gross  but that  s what makes it so much fun . it  s got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable . this movie is great to make fun of . rent it for a good laugh .  br    br   the film centers around three women newscasters  during a time way before cellphones . they go to a small town to cover a festival  but they can  t get a room to stay the night . and that  s when they meet ernest keller . he  s creepy in a psycho kind of way . and he offers to let them stay at his home . but he doesn  t tell them the truth about who lives there .  br    br   stephen furst  s performance is so amazing as  the unseen   that he really carries this film . most of the movie is kind of dull  although finding out the truth of ernest  s family is kind of interesting .  br    br   just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look . barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy .  br    br   i consider the movie an old gem  hard to find and worth a look .  

=======================================================================================================

907 ===> wow what a great premise for a film  set it around a film maker with writers block who decides to take up tango lessons . hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker whos interested in tango . gosh i wish i had that knack for genius . yes im being sarcastic .  br    br   it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . come on unless youre a rabid tango fan  i do concede they do exist judging by the comments  or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club    theres nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . even if youre into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road  br    br   coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films hes seen . gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters  weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company  fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body . the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie  br    br   ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter  

=======================================================================================================

908 ===> the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film   and even that was disappointing compared to some other films . my gawd   br    br   to me  this is the worst kind of film   one that assumes it  s a work of art because it has all the trappings of film  as  art . yes  it  s beautifully photographed  but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself . tango is a tease  it  s hot  it has drama  it  s audacious   precisely what this film is not .  

=======================================================================================================

909 ===> three girls  an all  female media  crew  including cult  actress barbara bach  no less  visiting a small town to cover a festival  end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague . well  made little shocker  suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue  scenes and a rather thin plot  line  that doesn  t do very well in hiding its secrets  . one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing  as in vintage shock  material   and this is basically what the film thrives on . performances  cinematography are pretty much above par  compared to many other late    s  early    s films in the same vein   but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax  scene in the basement  setting . from the moment that  keller junior  character was introduced  his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn  t close until the end of the film . a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick  who was funnily wacko in  one flew over the cuckoo  s nest   and now utterly demented in  the unseen   take on one of the leading roles .  

=======================================================================================================

910 ===> the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show . the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable . the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old  but good acting and production make the movie worth watching . the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects . i rated it an  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

911 ===> strange how less than  hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat  uninspiring drivel . if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter  wouldn  t you expect a little passion to show through in her performance  her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes  which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance  were instead awkward and painful to watch . obviously  revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting  and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness .  

=======================================================================================================

912 ===> dire . just dire . the script is contrived  the acting painful  and the story just drags along . it is  without a doubt  a celebration of sally potter and little else . this wouldn  t be so bad  but she  s the director  writer and star of the film  and so is just self  glorification . i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters  and the ending came not a moment too soon . it has two redeeming features . first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely  particularly in paris  and look rather good in black and white . secondly  whether you  re a fan of tango or not  the music is by and large  excellent  except where sally starts singing  . watch this film at your own risk  or if you need an unintentional laugh . i am sure it appeals to someone . statistically  it has to .  

=======================================================================================================

913 ===> gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast  a television reporter who travels with her crew  karen lamm and lois young  to solvang  california  to cover a danish festival . the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full . so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller  a phenomenal sydney lassick  . wouldn  t you know it  ernest and meek partner virginia  lelia goldoni  are hiding a big secret in their cellar pitiable  deformed  diaper  clad  junior   stephen furst  in a remarkable performance  who ultimately terrorizes the girls .  br    br   a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie . it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation  climax  delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour . the hotel and the foreboding cellar  large echoes of  psycho  here  are great settings . most of all  the perverse plot involves incest and patricide  allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality . and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one  dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls . the final shot is especially sad .  br    br    the unseen  is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery .  br    br

914 ===> get this film if at all possible . you will find a really good performance by barbara bach  beautiful cinematography of a stately  and incredibly clean  but creepy old house  and an unexpected virtuoso performance by   the unseen  . i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach  whom i  d just viewed in  the spy who loved me .  i love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little . so we start with a nice fresh premise . tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town  solvang  that celebrates its swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival . she brings along a camerawoman  who happens to be her sister  and another associate .  the late karen lamm plays bach  s sister  and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to  it is just too funny watching bach  mrs . ringo starr  and lamm  mrs . dennis wilson  going down the street having a sisterly quarrel .   anyway  bach  s disgruntled beau follows her to solvang  as he  s not done arguing with her . there  s a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn  t wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down  the  drain football career . the ladies arrive in solvang to do the assignment for their station  only to find their reservations were given away to someone else .  maybe to bach  s boyfriend  because think of it  where  s he gonna stay   . the gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go . mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum  they catch the interest of proprietor mr . keller  the late sidney lassick   who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home  insisting his wife will be happy to receive them . oh no  next thing we know keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife  warning her that company  s coming and threatening that she  d better play along . trouble in paradise  the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to solvang to shoot footage and interview swedes  but one of the girls doesn  t feel good . bach and lamm leave her behind  wondering to themselves about mrs . keller  played heartbreakingly by pretty lelia goldoni  who looks like she just lost her best pal . speaking of which  under  the  weather vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub  not realizing that keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole . she hears him  thinks he  s come to deliver linen  and calls out her thanks . lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn  t get a long enough look . after he  s left  poor vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast  in a really decent  frightening round of action  by something big that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  the unseen  lamm comes home next  bach is out finishing an argument with her beau  and can  t find anyone in the house . she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen  and  on hands and knees to collect it  her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting the unseen again  well  at about the time poor lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen  we do a flashback into mr . keller  s past and get the full story of what his sick  sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn  t smile much . bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are . meanwhile  lassick has been apprised of the afternoon  s carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can  t let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home . he tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us .  br    br   i cannot say enough for stephen furst  whom i  d never seen before it  s obvious that he did his homework for this role  studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged bach and goldoni  each in their diverse way  just give the movie luster . not only that  but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution . no stupid cheap tricks  eyeball  rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners . . . a real treat for your collection .  

=======================================================================================================

915 ===> the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims . on the surface  it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface  what lies is a not  so  positive message about rape . aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman . she needs a man to help her . when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her  she does not stand up for herself . it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying .  br    br   the director  satish kaushik  went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive . what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way . the director is famous for being chauvinistic . his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles . he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial  it does not mean that the character herself is strong .  br    br   the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya  cleans  herself after just being raped . she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty . though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light  what he does not show us is whether ash  s father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing . thus we are left with a confusing message about rape .  br    br   the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this . even more so  the comedy is simply not funny . ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout . the music is mediocre except for the title track  which is beautifully picturised  the only bright point of this film  . sonali bendre  s role is disappointing and pointless . overall  what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish  mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion .

916 ===>  . . . but a lousy film . as maltin says this was christopher lee  s attempt to make a serious horror film . well  it is serious . . . too serious  the plot is silly and slow  something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality  . . . the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again . i actually dozed off a few times  the film is sooooo dull  the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee . . . but this was probably a labor of love for both  they often complained about horror movies being too violent . . . well  this has no violence   . avoid at all costs . . . unless you have insomnia . . . this will put you to sleep   

=======================================================================================================

917 ===> all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing . the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva locke and chris lazar or as i like to call them the minis . the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do . the main actors and actresses i . e . jessica alba michael weatherly etc . make you forget you are watching a fictional t . v . show they seem to make this show come alive . all in all this is the best show i have ever watched  

=======================================================================================================

918 ===> upon the first viewing  i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tales . after many more  i think it  s one of the best . some of the songs are pretty bad  especially the love song  but two things stand out that make the movie  even the singing  worthwhile . one is the art direction . like the other cannon movie tales  this is a beautifully decorated period piece every piece of cloth and jewel  both of which have major parts in this movie  s plot  look fresh and new  and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants . even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess  wonderfully done . the other thing is the comic timing . a lot of the movie is cheesy  but the emperor  s vanity  and his making fun of himself in the end   the suspicious guard  the guard chasing nicholas  and the stupid prince  were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose . and the sequence during the song weave  o makes up for the songs that weren  t so good .  

=======================================================================================================

919 ===> in spite of having some exciting  and daring  sequences  nbtn just never gets going . there are exploding boats  hat pin murders  mass suicides  pathologists with body parts  and all sorts of classic mystery  horror scenes  but they  re interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition . everybody in the movie looks bored . this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed .  br    br   add to this the  too  proper  brit characters and you feel like you  ve drifted into a sherlock holmes movie .  br    br   finally  the cinematography is very ordinary . there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside  or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire  but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull .  br    br   definitely only for lee and cushing fans .  

=======================================================================================================

920 ===> i won  t add to the plot reviews  it  s not very good .  br    br   very improbable orphanage on bala .  br    br   cushing and lee at their height .  br    br   some nice scenery .  br    br   good for face spotting  and i quote   look at the mouth  that is cassie from fools and horses  .  br    br   otherwise  a poor example of the british film industry .  br    br   fulton mackay was far better in fraggle rock  keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did best .  br    br   redeeming feature  it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription . i won  t be subscribing on this effort .  

=======================================================================================================

921 ===>   hatred of a minute  is a hauntingly beautiful film . a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer  eric seaver . strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a  must see  for any film student or horror fan . the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies . some shout outs to the film  s producer  bruce campbell as well as to the film  the evil dead  add some humor for anyone that knows the genre .  

=======================================================================================================

922 ===> michael kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as eric seaver  a troubled young man who was horribly mistreated as a little boy by his monstrous  abusive  alcoholic stepfather barry  a genuinely frightening portrayal by gunnar hansen  . eric has a compassionate fianc  sweetly played by the lovely tracee newberry  and a job transcribing autopsy reports at a local morgue . haunted by his bleak past  egged on by the bald  beaming jack the demon  a truly creepy michael robert brandon   and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother  eric goes off the deep end and embarks on a brutal killing spree . capably directed by kallio  who also wrote the tight  astute script   with uniformly fine acting by a sound no  name cast  jeff steiger is especially good as eric  s wannabe helpful guardian angel michael   rather rough  but overall polished cinematography by george lieber  believable true  to  life characters  jolting outbursts of raw  shocking and unflinchingly ferocious violence  a moody  spooky score by dan kolton  an uncompromisingly downbeat ending  grungy detroit  michigan locations  a grimly serious tone  and a taut  gripping narrative that stays on a steady track throughout  this extremely potent and gritty psychological horror thriller makes for often absorbing and disturbing viewing . a real sleeper .  

=======================================================================================================

923 ===>   three daring daughters  is a sickly sweet  rose  colored look at divorce  remarriage  and single  parent living . obviously  social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted  takes a cruise  and then dates and marries a band conductor . even when the  its just a movie  phrase excuses the script from addressing real  life problems   daughters  suffers from too many incoherent high  note songs  children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself . isn  t it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married   br    br   admittedly  this movie was released in the nineteen forties . only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make  daughters  a tolerable film .  

=======================================================================================================

924 ===> in an otherwise good review  loleralacartelort     says  the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum  anti  radiation  alloy . it is not that well  known . and the exact specifications are a secret . and why is it a secret well  why should they reveal it back then   if they where in a space race with the russians  then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation .  this is completely incorrect . there is  and was  no  secret  to radiation protection in apollo . the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available . it uses a lightweight  honeycomb  of aluminum and stainless steel . the entire outer surface  except the windows of course  is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin  thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re  entry . these materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space  charged particles  than lead  which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x  rays and gamma rays .  br    br   space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares . but it simply wasn  t a serious threat to the apollo astronauts . the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief     hour or so  passage through the van allen belts . they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than  .  rem  and usually much less . of the   men who flew to the moon    of whom landed     are still alive . only two have died from cancer alan shepard  leukemia  and jack swigert  bone cancer  . the rest died from heart attacks  pancreatitis  roosa   and a motorcycle accident  conrad  . these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late   s  shepard would be    .  

=======================================================================================================

925 ===>   hatred of a minute  is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years . not to say that it  s a brilliant film by any means  but it  s definitely worth a watch .  br    br    hatred  chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver  played by director kallio   a formerly abused child now grown up  and starting to listen to his evil side .  br    br    hatred  is very nice visually . the shots are creative  and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at . this film actually has an element of production value to it  unlike other recent michigan releases like  dark tomorrow  and  biker zombies .  subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film  s         budget .  br    br   however   hatred  stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do  and that  s in the story and character department . essentially  things just kind  of happen . eric seaver doesn  t evolve at all . basically  he  s always been crazy  it  s just that people are starting to notice . the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development . also  the ending is very abrupt .  br    br   however  since this is a horror film  since when do we care about plot  we just want to see people die  and  hatred  certainly delivers . as the body count mounted  people in the theater started cheering  kill her  kill em  all   when people scream back at the screen  it  s always fun .  br    br   that  s the place where  hatred  succeeds . it  s fun . and in the end  that  s all that really matters .  

=======================================================================================================

926 ===> this is a decent little flick made in michigan  about a guy that is haunted by his past  with his abusive stepfather  gunnar hansen  and has grown up not  so  well  adjusted . in fact  he  s absolutely bonkers  but tries not to be too obvious . he  s got an entourage too  his own little demon  angel that follow him around . the demon never says a word but really  doesn  t have to  and he  s max schreck  creepy . let  s just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this  as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better  like  freeing  people that he decides need it  mostly beautiful young women . this is a decent portrayal of madness  and you  re kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what  s going on  but overall  i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest . it  s a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on . a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks .  

=======================================================================================================

927 ===> this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn  t there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo   went through the van allan radiation belts they spent   min  s there not the   min  s claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray .  br    br   seriously do some research learn what really happened don  t let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened  

=======================================================================================================

928 ===> i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings             or not old enough to appreciate them . i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it .  br    br   i was a youngster at the time of apollo  but i was old enough to understand what was going on . the entire world followed the moon landings . our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch . newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings  on each day  from launch to landing  from moonwalks to moon liftoff  all the way to splashdown  in a multitude of languages . in school  some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv . during apollo   the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate . you couldn  t go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was . the world was truly one community .  br    br   now with a buffer of    odd years after the fact  it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down . we are left with our history books  and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to  prove  it with a bunch of lies and made  up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise   not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days .  

=======================================================================================================

929 ===> despite the occasionally stilted acting and  seen  it  all  before  story  this is a fairly compelling movie .  br    br   it has suspense  the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy  some of the visual effects are superb and best of all  no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film  as too many  wannabe  horror films have in them now  br    br   honestly  this isn  t the greatest film ever made  but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character development  br    br   i was glad i watched it  

=======================================================================================================

930 ===> michigan  edgar allen poe  a toaster  and a frying pan . . . if you don  t mind the psycho  thriller or horror film genre  and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted  this is the movie for you . an amazingly well developed first film   hatred of a minute  has all the draw of mainstream hits like  silence of the lambs  and of cult classics like  army of darkness .  the editing and effects are well done  better than many films in the genre . kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and poe  s writings . at a time when big budget  big name films lack much in the way of substance  the independent film has resurrected this dying trait . if you love michigan  a good story  or a decent thriller go check out  hatred of a minute .   

=======================================================================================================

931 ===> the only reason i didn  t score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film . it is a technically adept film .  br    br   that having been said  this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven . most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program  rather than actual fact . and sibrel  s  irrefutable proof  that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics .  br    br   i do not recommend watching this  but if you do  see it at google video for free . don  t let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity .  

=======================================================================================================

932 ===> ouch  this one was a bit painful to sit through . it has a cute and amusing premise  but it all goes to hell from there . matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying  and he does not disappoint in this one . deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances . alan bates and jennifer tilly  among others  played it way over the top . i know that  s the way the parts were written  and it  s hard to blame actors  when the script and director have them do such schlock . if you  re going to have outrageous characters  that  s ok  but you gotta have good material to make it work . it didn  t here . run away screaming from this movie if at all possible .  

=======================================================================================================

933 ===> i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words  clueless and appalling nonsense .  i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment . one has to suspend one  s disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love  have a child and live together happily ever after . but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one  s heart warmed . is it so impossible  there are far more implausible events described in other movies . the acting is good  the script is funny . the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality .  

=======================================================================================================

934 ===> this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in     . it was a revelation to us . we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children . obviously we were wrong . love may come from where you don  t expect it and maybe don  t want it . but we both chose that love anyway .  br    br   and no  it never changed our sexual orientation . that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos .  br    br   when we were young we both had affairs  but never with the opposite sex . as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs .  br    br   this story is not far fetched . however  the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me . my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last   years . we are still gay . end of story .  

=======================================================================================================

935 ===> the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo    and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day .  br    br   this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the  whole earth  picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window .  br    br   i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa  though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map  and the ones in private hands would still be a problem .  br    br   ah  a response  trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i  d say is a charming  but weak and gullible argument . what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie  a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels . do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here     this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u . s . government that the moon  missions were a success  and that man now are true masters of the universe . things are nearly never quite what they seem . . just watch the movie  and i dear say you  ll see things a bit different than before .   br    br   first off  weather data doesn  t come from nasa  it comes for met agencies around the world . second  the weather data undermines a major claim in the film . third  far from being  packed with irrefutable evidence   the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked . sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film  so he edited it and added his own interpretation . unfortunately for him  his source film is public domain  and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims .  

=======================================================================================================

936 ===> there are so many incorrect statements in this so  called  documentary  that i found myself shouting at the television .  br    br   bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd  but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims .  br    br   he relies on either being inaccurate  not telling the full story  or the old favourite  government always lies to us  innuendos  and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims .  br    br   what  s more  his  exclusive  or  unreleased  footage is freely available over the internet from various sites .  br    br   further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews  and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions .  br    br   all of the claims made by mr sibrel about  inaccuracies    mistakes   or  whistleblowing  in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven .  br    br   how do i get that    odd minutes of my life back   

=======================================================================================================

937 ===> this movie is as unique as it is overlooked . . . . . . a different story is just that  it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain  one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind . i first saw this on cable in the late    s and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time . i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life . it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family . this film should be available on dvd  vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster  perry king can be acknowledged  but to show how far we have come  still have to go where relationships are concerned .  

=======================================================================================================

938 ===> in order to stop her homosexual friend albert  perry king  from being deported back to belgium  stella  meg foster  decides to marry him . the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian . the two have their separate lives when one night after albert  s birthday party  they fall into bed and then into love . later in the film after falling in love  stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing . what she finds will leave the viewer stunned . this is a great film  very original . perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here . very controversial upon its release in      the  r  rated film is now  pg  in this much more liberal time .  br    br   recently released on dvd  the disc contains a  making of  segment on the special features and in it it  s stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not  real  are mistaken . everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons  these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved   

=======================================================================================================

939 ===> writer  director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa . he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks . the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time  and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film .  br    br   unfortunately sibrel  s research is so slipshod that he doesn  t realize his  backstage  footage is really taken in large part from the    minute live telecast  also on that reel  that was seen by millions  not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies . and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts  audio in the footage  because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera  not faking footage .  br    br   finally  anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel  s hacked  up version of it .  he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk  s assassination than of his  smoking gun  .  sibrel thinks he  s the only one who  s seen it . what  s more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use  such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth  destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth .  br    br   as with most films of this type  sibrel relies on innuendo  inexpert assumption  misleading commentary  and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence .  

=======================================================================================================

940 ===> there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on  drunken rampage  by russian soldiers  which is completely untrue . this movie should not be shown only because of this .  br    br   also there is a statement by someone  that kgb prosecuted  jews  gypsies etc   which is  worse than nazis  . kgb was looking for so called  zionist  agents  who were  kgb believed  imperialist agents . this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation  as nazis did . gypsies were never prosecuted . kgb was political tool and used politically  but from internationalist standpoint . communists really did not distinguish between nationalities .  br    br   whole movie stinks like fake . main hero does not speak russian  signs in berlin contains typographical errors  kgb general looks totally phony . some so called  russian proverbs  are totally made up  and list goes on and on .  br    br   not recommended to watch  this movie is full of lies  and phony stuff . go to  good shepherd  instead .

941 ===> this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire  well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone  and learn about the people who lived there .  br    br   i enjoyed the story  characters  acting and scenes . a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly  otherwise a wonderful piece .  br    br   the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it . the scenes with her and alex descas  nadir  are charming and lovely .  br    br   i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating .  

=======================================================================================================

942 ===> harem suare is the best film i saw in the year     . bravo ferzan ozpetek . sensually shot and stunningly portrayed  harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance  which is such a taboo in hollywood . women of all shapes  sizes  and color  populate the film . cut off from the outside world  the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue  rivalry and jealousies within their ranks .  

=======================================================================================================

943 ===> i do regret that i have bought this series . i expected more action  more objective picture and more consistency . this is just a pure propaganda series  very dark  without any charm  or romanticism  it is just boredom itself . i find the actors work quite weak as well . o  donnell might seem charming as robin  with batman   but in this picture he lacks any charm . probably while he becomes older  he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up . it comes as no surprise  that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for    of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands .  

=======================================================================================================

944 ===> proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold . this is most definitely plastic  all the way . its easy to see that without quentin  s involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years  that  s assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place . it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes  angela jones is unconvincing in this role  william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment  . all in all pretty poor .  

=======================================================================================================

945 ===> dolph lundgren is back  detention marks dolphs first film in nearly  years  and that is following the delayed hidden agenda . this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips  agent red and stormcatcher . however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda  which was better in almost every respect . what this film does have in it  s favour from dolph  s previous outing  is a sense of cheesy fun . the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role  and it  s good to see dolph doing his own stunts again .  br    br   the films story is ludicrous and prime b  movie material . an ex  military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching  whilst taking a detention class  he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal . the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches . if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy . thankfully the filmmakers don  t take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability  this film has a so bad it  s enjoyable kind of vibe .  br    br   where the film is let down is miss  using a fairly decent budget . the budget of around   million has not been well spent . it  s all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination . the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse . there are some good moments . you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning  with plenty of destruction . the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen .  br    br   as for the cast . hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages . there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film . this however has problems . the actors are on the most part bad . the bad guys are terrible  but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness . the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters . they all hate authority  each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons  but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability . this movie is all about dolph though . while this film is nowhere near his best  it is nowhere near his worst . it also marks a turning point in his career . he is now back in good shape  and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action . dolph looks enthusiastic here  he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man  running from explosions in slow  mo  one liners  and handling large weapons  again in a movie like his older ones  albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one . it is good to see dolph looking energised . his films of the last  or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary  and using doubles a lot  he still does all the fights himself though  but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it .  br    br   overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode . there  s not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm .   

=======================================================================================================

946 ===> this is an absolute great show . jessica alba  besides being the most beautiful women in the world  is a great actress . she does a great job of portraying max  and i could never see anyone else doing that role . she is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous .  

=======================================================================================================

947 ===> the idea is nice . bringing so many stars in one movie is great . but . . . . too many stories  too short and lacking really any sense . no connection between the scenes . there were some    brilliant stories . . . but these were out of   . the frame reminded me of  all the invisible children   a movie which i liked a lot . compared to it  however   paris je t  aime  lacks the intriguing short story  which develops  starts and has its end . and it lacks the topic connecting all those  children . i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect   short sketches together . perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting . otherwise  i wouldn  t recommend it . . .  

=======================================================================================================

948 ===> from it  s uninspiring title to the flat acting performances  curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout . the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantino  s name is attached to it  and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez  tarantino flick  from dusk till dawn  . these things do not make a great movie  however  and this is more than evident all the way through  curdled  . the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas  and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing . the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool  but it  s becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican  it doesn  t fit with the tone of the movie . the film  s plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who  because of her obsession with grisly murders  takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes . it sounds boring and it is .  br    br   william baldwin is the only  name  on the cast list  and even he doesn  t make an impression . he hasn  t been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing  he  s pretty much wasted . angela jones  or rather the taxi driver from pulp fiction  takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman  and it is always clear that it  s her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role  not her acting ability . she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino  s masterpiece  but she doesn  t have the talent to lead a film by herself . she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film  and if it weren  t for her latino accent she wouldn  t convince the audience that she  s a weirdo on any level . curdled is a one hundred percent  proof piece of forgettable trash . films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels . whether you  re a tarantino fan  william baldwin fan  horror fan or just a movie buff this is one to miss .  

=======================================================================================================

949 ===> this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick  it isn  t going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie . our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day . sure the script isn  t going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action . dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes  and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well . all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick  but youv  e seen it a million times before .  

=======================================================================================================

950 ===> i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw . it was a cool fun movie . dolph looked superbly cool on the bike . he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies . he is now in a pretty good shape . the story was ok and the other actors were also passable . i wouldn  t call this movie his best but its still a good movie .  br    br   but it also had its share of problems . the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target . they should  ve had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way . another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing . i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom . the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers . there should  ve been more bad guys . last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy  but that was due to the small budget . overall the movie was a good movie . i enjoyed it . i would recommend others to watch it . p . s . now u r a dead beat cop .  some one  liners were also cool   br    br    

=======================================================================================================

951 ===> geordies . . . salt of the earth characters . . . bricklayers . . . beer . . . geordies . . . happy go lucky . . . adventures working abroad . . . salt of the earth characters . . . warm wonderful people . . . tyne bridge  tear in the eye  . . . brown ale . . . salt of the earth characters . . . cute little red indians children in newcastle united tops . . . emetic . . . geordies . . . salt of the earth characters . . .  br    br   etc etc etc . . . .  br    br   please . this is so poor . and you should know better timothy spall . they can  t have paid you that much .  br    br   as for jimmy nail . well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an  actor  as he is a singer and writer . come on jimmy  the joke  s over .  crocodile shoes  and  spender  were very funny  unfortunately i don  t think they were supposed to be . with  auf wiedersehen pet  the opposite applies .  

=======================================================================================================

952 ===> usually i  m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties  early nineties film featuring now has beens . . . but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through . guys dressing up as girls has been done to death  but never so pathetically . corey haim  s performance was abysmal as usual  nicole eggert was not much better . this has no redeeming qualities  even if you are a number   fan of an actor  actress in this piece of trash  stay away   

=======================================================================================================

953 ===> the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler  s grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe .  br    br   clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the  allied bias  turning out to be historical fact . the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east . the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds .  br    br   the disparity between hitler  s military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag  declaring  peace in our time  to this day has durable propaganda qualities . here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options  freedom or slavery . in     there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively .  

=======================================================================================================

954 ===> adolf hitler  s maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u . s . war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii . hitler  s plan was methodical and well conceived  starting with the conquest of eastern europe  expanding to the european heartland  then moving on to the  world island  consisting of europe  asia and africa . his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world .  br    br   in      hitler ordered national conscription  as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell . grade school children sang his praises  and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps . marching unopposed into austria in      hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland . in      hitler took all of czechoslovakia . later in the year  the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non  aggression pact with it  s mortal enemy russia  a ploy to delay hitler  s military involvement on too many fronts . immediately after  germany invaded poland  bringing hitler  s conquest right to russia  s doorstep . he would deal with her later .  br    br   it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler  s thrust across europe . prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany  his infamous declaration stating  peace in our time  . it didn  t turn out that way .  br    br   the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment  at least to me  was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid     s . it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland . the venue  madison square garden   

=======================================================================================================

955 ===> i  d never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought i  d give it a shot . unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed . tarzan was over   years old and somewhat overweight . not how i  d imagined tarzan would look . and  unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea  tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell . also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees  leaping from vine to vine .  br    br   oh well  so much for expectations . anyway  jane was there  the monkey cheeta was there . there was some guy with a guitar there . there were villains and good guys and a romance . . . all very harmless and predictable . nothing bad  you understand  but equally nothing good .  br    br   probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan      

=======================================================================================================

956 ===> last of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films and a good thing too  as this is easily the worst of the   films he made over a period of   years . no mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people  who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride . she finds tarzan and jane  who try to protect her . george zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn  t used to his full advantage . also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player  singer who goes into song every so often . even the  great  robert florey can  t aid this one .  br    br        of four   

=======================================================================================================

957 ===> i can  t understand what it is that fans of the genre didn  t like about this film . it was truly a lot of fun . the special effects were wonderful . i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters  but not this time . i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn  t enjoy the film . i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen  but again this was not the case . to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time . blair witch and the mummy . both films that i thought were terrible . blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time . the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck . people liked it for it  s special effects . films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development  they are more like funhouse rides . well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting  s e  ticket .  

=======================================================================================================

958 ===> what can i say that hasn  t been said about  the haunting   it has everything that would make a great picture . wonderful sets  moody music  and sound design to die for were all in place . the screenplay  though  sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird  surrealistic way . the entire team must have forgotten to read it through  maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was . each member of the cast gives a worthy performance  although with little conviction to the material at hand . lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her . but that  s about it . all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours  but you will definitely want more . a lot more .  

=======================================================================================================

959 ===> the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one . there are a few things that derail this film .  br    br   first  tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals . in my opinion  any footwear on tarzan  whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed  takes away from the character  which is supposed to be anti  civilization and pro  jungle .  br    br   second  the character of benji  as mentioned in a previous post  totally derails the movie as the comic foil . to me  his character is unnecessary to the film  s plot .  br    br   also  while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan  it  s apparent that he was not in his best shape . although in his later jungle jim movies  his physique had improved somewhat from this film .  br    br   the octopus battle is a terrific idea  but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak . likewise  the battle  which takes only   seconds tops  would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to   seconds to  minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate .  br    br   and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye  it doesn  t manage to salvage this last weissmuller film  a disappointing ending to a great character run .  

=======================================================================================================

960 ===> johnny weissmuller  s final film as  king of the jungle   after   years in the role  tarzan and the mermaids  is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans . at    the ex  olympian  one of hollywood  s most active  party animals   was long past the slim athleticism of his youth  and looked tired  although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry  tarzan and the huntress  .  br    br   not only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role johnny sheffield  the quintessential  boy   had grown to manhood  he was a strapping    year old   so he was written out of the script  under the pretext of being  away at school  . brenda joyce  at    was appearing in her fourth of five films as  jane   she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan  in      s tarzan  s magic fountain  and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever .  br    br   produced by sol lesser  at rko  on a minuscule budget  the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico . while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa  veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively  incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the story .  br    br   when a young island girl  tyrone power  s future bride  linda christian  is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan  he learns that a local high priest  george zucco  one of filmdom  s most enduring villains  had virtually enslaved the local population  threatening retribution from a living  god  if they don  t do his bidding . the girl had been chosen to become the  god  s  bride  so she fled . faster than you can say  is this a dumb plot or what    the girl is kidnapped by the priest  s henchmen and returned to the island  and tarzan  followed by jane  colorful spanish character  benjy   charmingly played by john laurenz  who sings several tunes   and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest  poor cheeta is left behind  . after a series of discoveries  the  god  is simply a con man in an aztec mask  working with the priest in milking the island  s rich pearl beds   a bit of brawling action  and comic relief and songs by benjy  everything reaches the expected happy conclusion .  br    br   remarkably  tarzan and the mermaids features a musical score by the brilliant film composer  dimitri tiomkin  and is far better than what you  d expect from this  b  movie   br    br   while the film would provide a less  than  auspicious end to weissmuller  s time in tarzan  s loincloth  he would immediately go on to play jungle jim  a more eloquent variation of the ape man  in khakis   the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been .  br    br   tarzan was about to get a make over  and become much sexier . . .  

=======================================================================================================

961 ===> i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the season  although season  was not as good as season  which is excellent indeed    i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon .  failed     i am a chinese student and it  s inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and   . i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow   

=======================================================================================================

962 ===> i rented this movie this past weekend  cranked up the surround sound system  and got some great sound from special affects . this movie is a great movie rental  the special affects where enough to scare my fiance  but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated . i didn  t go to the movies and see this  but its a scary late night don  t feel like going out movie . i would recommend it   

=======================================================================================================

963 ===> this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i  ve ever seen . and that  s saying a lot  considering i  ve seen such stinkers like demon of paradise  lovers  lane  and bloody murder  which is a close second  . however  i love bad horror movies  and as you can tell from my username  this one really sticks out . at times there  s nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick . as for this film  the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever  especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened  years prior to the rest of the film . the acting is nonexistent  and most of the camera shot are of women  s areas shrink wrapped in spandex . the policeman was the most stone  faced  monotone actor i  ve ever seen . the best  worst part of this movie  however  has to be the murder weapon . a giant safety pin   what were they thinking  who  s the killer  a disgruntled  huggies  employee  i  d have to give this movie an overall zero  but darned if i didn  t have a blast watching it  

=======================================================================================================

964 ===> want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work  just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman  s club . that  s what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end . this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen  but every time i was ready to switch the channel  they  d add another scene with the workout girls and i  d stay put . as a slasher film  killer workout fails in every category i can think of . as a showcase for beautiful girls working out  it is a success . strong recommendation to avoid  unless the thought of half the film being a big ta show appeals to you .  

=======================================================================================================

965 ===> i don  t know why the critics trashed this movie . i hardly ever agree with them anyway .  br    br   the movie could have been a little scarier  i don  t usually go to horror movies  i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime . i needn  t have bothered     the cinema was full of kids too  heh    . . . liam was great as always . i also liked catharine zeta jones  theo  and lili taylor  eleanor  nell   br    br   the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way . the special and sound effects were awesome . i also loved the music score  particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children  how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power  peace and freedom .  

=======================================================================================================

966 ===> i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie . i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original     haunting as well as most of the hammer films . this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it . yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts . actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great . i have seen it   times now and it gets better every time . the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the  th sense . the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring . perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure . the old haunting was also a fine film from     . it was even more scary . see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin .  

=======================================================================================================

967 ===> one two three four five six seven eight and back  haha . this is a must see  first of all to see the work out . there are a lot of work out shown  see those close ups  man you will enjoy it . a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie . it  s a slasher but without suspense . the ending is funny too  and the clothes she  s wearing in the wood confronting the copper  jesus  looks like a clown . the killings are mostly done off screen  the blood flows but never too gory . there are a lot of fight scene  s too  and hey  no one got hurt . and what about the weapon to kill  never seen a big one like that  won  t spoil it  you must see it . and being a slasher there  s a lot of ta too . to guess who  s the killer you will be trapped a few times and that  s the best part  but what about the story of the copper in the woods  huh  but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have . i  m glad that i have my copy  one of those slasher failures . but man  those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles  if you are in your    s then this is one is back to memory lane .  

=======================================================================================================

968 ===> big hair  big boobs  bad music and a giant safety pin . . . . . . . these are the words to best describe this terrible movie . i love cheesy horror movies and i  ve seen hundreds . . but this had got to be on of the worst ever made . the plot is paper thin and ridiculous  the acting is an abomination  the script is completely laughable  the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is  it  s just so damn terribly written   the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures  the hair is big  lots of boobs bounce  men wear those cut tee  shirts that show off their stomachs  sickening that men actually wore them    and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again . . . in almost every scene there is trashy music  boobs and paramedics taking away bodies . . . . and the gym still doesn  t close for bereavement   all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the    s and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then .  

=======================================================================================================

969 ===> it seems to be a perfect day for swimming . a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach . unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this  whereas the tide is rising . the woman  barbara stanwyck  takes the car and searches for help .  br    br   john sturges  short movie    minutes  is powerful because of unanswered questions . stanwyck finds a guy who could help  but there is a price she has to pay for this . there is a double question the movie poses . how far would you go to help the man that you love  and on the other hand  observing stanwyck  s behaviors towards the stranger  does she really love her husband  like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself .  

=======================================================================================================

970 ===> what a great barbara stanwyck film that i happened to see the other night .  jeopardy  was fantastic . it was made in     and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat .  br    br   barbara stanwyck plays helen  who with husband doug  barry sullivan  and son  lee aaker  drive to an isolated fishing spot in mexico for a vacation . husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if barbara drives back to a garage for some rope .  br    br   while there she runs into a psychotic killer  ralph meeker  one of my favourites  and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as barbara tries everything in her power to get meeker to come back with her to free her husband .  br    br   the film was so suspenseful and such a surprise  i was not expecting such a great film . but i suppose i should have realized  is there anything barbara stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful

971 ===> what can i say . a kamal hassan movie being horrible . he acts very well  but it is a horrible story  along with horrible direction . in my kind opinion  the director gautham menon must give up directing . there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie . apart from that  one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes . there was no practicality in the movie . gautham is just running out of stories . but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well . the villains look too ugly  though their performance was not bad . i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family . you will not get sleep seeing this movie   however  harris jayaraj again did a great job  and that is why i have given this movie  out of   . his song  partha modail nallae  is soulful and soothing . apart from that  great cinematography . on the whole  this is just a bad  bad movie . kamal hassan  i think  should have rejected this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

972 ===> i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of kamal hassan . he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever . but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen . after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better .  br    br   the protagonist  raghavan  is a very daring police officer . who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders . raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers  two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students  behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree . finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives .  br    br   these two psycho  killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters . the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly  which the movie could have survived without .  br    br   to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty . the director  gautham  should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience . certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham  s name on the production list .  

=======================================================================================================

973 ===> the only time i have seen this movie was when i was   years old . i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn  t sleep for a week or more after seeing it . it just absolutely rattled me . i was on vacation with my aunts in ft . worth  texas and i will never forget it . now    years later  my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult . it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it . i very much enjoyed it  but it gave me quite a scare  jaqui  

=======================================================================================================

974 ===>   i like cheap perfume better it doesn  t last as long . . .   ralph meeker  s convict character  lawson  tells this to barbara stanwyck  s helen character  after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w  her husband in tijuana . . .  this line cracked me up  and also seemed like a metaphor for this film  that cheap is better than expensive  because a cheap perfume  loving man who has a way with a  x  is a better man to have around in the long run  i agree with some of the other comments posted about helen  s attraction to lawson . even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away  she did seem attracted to his fiery nature  and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn  t likely wash away with the tide   

=======================================================================================================

975 ===> filmatography excellent  nice camera angles  i don  t remember seeing a movie of late  with good close  ups  until this one  . could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera . ny is pictured good . i liked the upside down angles  in particular  a different touch  .  br    br   music not impressive . songs don  t stick around in your mind even after watching the movie . may be  i expected same quality like  anniyan  . a disappointment .  br    br   actors kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard  core action sequences . his age and belly really show up . also  he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward . it was a very awkward to see a mature  aged star still trying to play like a    heroes scenes . love can be expressed at any age as we get older  you still can express love nicely from a distance  without touching a woman too much . for example  the love expressed by rajinikanth in  chandrmukhi   .  br    br   jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie . not sure why she accepted this . well  that is not my problem  i guess .  br    br   others just have a small presence .  br    br   direction i expected gautham to excel  or measure  up  to his other movie  kakka kakka  . he disappointmented me . it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues . he slips in few scenes . even abvious things got slipped from a famous director .  br    br   overall just a okay movie . too much graphics . definitely not for kids  and adults who expect some kind of  entertainment   .  br    br   thx  

=======================================================================================================

976 ===> based upon the recommendation of a friend  my wife and i invited another couple to this film . i really apologized to them   all  of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end . half the vignettes are bizarre  with very little entertainment value . there were few scenes of paris   for example  i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter  but i couldn  t really recognize anything . most of the scene was inside a bar . no one in the theater laughed at anything  or reacted in any way . if you like bizarre  pretentious  pseudo  intellectual films  don  t miss this . if you are down to earth like me  you will be sorry you saw it .  

=======================================================================================================

977 ===> i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get  go . when miss stanwyck starts her narration it  s only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming . the deserted area  the lock on the deserted gas station door  everything sets you up to wait for it . . . here it comes . at first you think it will be about the little boy  but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in . i found this movie to be really stressful  even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement . now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating  maybe a white knuckles award   

=======================================================================================================

978 ===> jeopardy is a tense  satisying thriller  a cut above a b but not really a major production . it qualifies as almost an experimental film  as the studio that produced it  metro  was desperately looking for new kinds of films  stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television . the director  john sturges  was an up  and  comer whose best years lay ahead . he had just recently begun directing a level films  and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman . stars barbara stanwyck  barry sullivan and ralph meeker  were at very different phases of their careers . stanwyck  s glory years were behind her  and yet she could still carry a film  as she proves here . barry sullivan  as her husband  was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him . he was a fine  low  key actor  poised  but in an upper middle rather than upper class way  which made him excellent in professional roles . as the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save sullivan  s life  he is trapped under a pier  and the tide is rising   ralph meeker is more energetic than usual . this excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after brando and clift . he was in his way as good an actor as either of them  but he lacked charisma . his bargaining with stanwyck  which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband  by implication only  as this is       makes for an intriguing premise which  had this been a different kind of film  could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about stanwyck  s character . meeker is indeed a more exciting character than sullivan and in her scenes with him stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son . but as this is a formula picture  not a strindberg play  the possibility that stanwyck might want want to have a fling    leaving aside the question of her husband  s predicament    remains unexplored . in this sense the incoming tide doesn  t quite have the effect one might have wished  though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting  fine location photography  nearly all of it outdoors  and excellent direction by the woefully underrated mr . sturges .  

=======================================================================================================

979 ===> it  s  the f . b . i .  starring reed hadley  with an all  star guest cast  the film begins with an accidental  convenient   kidnapping  which leads to one thing  and another  which doesn  t really indicate the main story  which is a  big house  u . s . a .  prison break story . the story is very improbable  to say the least . it  s like a tv show  only more  violent   for the times  .  br    br   but  the cast is a trip  picture this ralph meeker is sent to prison his cell  mates are the following criminals broderick crawford  lon chaney jr .  charles bronson  reading a  muscle  magazine    and william talman  reading a  detective  magazine   . honest  you should know that  an early scene reveals what happens to the  missing  boy  answering the ending  voiceover .  if you don  t want to have that hanging  don  t miss the opening scenes between the  iceman  and the boy  peter votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic  .  br    br    big house  u . s . a .       howard w . koch  broderick crawford  ralph meeker  reed hadley  

=======================================================================================================

980 ===> i am definitely a burt reynolds fan  but sorry  this one really stinks . most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie . i can  t believe he even made this one . is he actually that hard up for money   

=======================================================================================================

981 ===> here  s an excellent barbara stanwyck double bill on one disc . the first movie  and believe me the lesser of the two  is mgm  s  to please a lady        in which she is paired with clark gable . it is essentially a star vehicle with gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence . here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins . of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close . a bit of a fluff of a move really but gable and stanwyck  two icons of the golden age  make it watchable   br    br   but the real meat on this dvd is the second feature  a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called jeopardy . produced by mgm in     this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn  t dated one iota  here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes . a dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what  yes  the tide is coming in . with not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself stanwyck sets off by car for assistance . after driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict  ralph meeker  who  in return for his help  wants more from her than money or a change of clothes   i  ll do anything to save my husband   . does she or doesn  t she   .  br    br   meeker runs away with the picture  he turns in quite a brilliant performance  once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him  an actor in the smouldering brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films . although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury  disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding mann  stewart western  naked spur        and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in stanley kubrick  s powerful ww  drama  paths of glory        his only real claim to fame was as mike hammer in mickey spillane  s  kiss me deadly  in     . his performance in  jeopardy  should have done wonders for him but he had only a so  so career in films . he died in     .  br    br   because of this release  jeopardy  can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir . a memorable  taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances  tight direction by john sturges  the crisp monochrome cinematography of victor milner and an atmospheric score by dimitri tiomkin . extras  however are no great shakes except for a radio version of  jeopardy  and trailers for both movies .  br    br   this disc is also part of a barbara stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary . hard to believe that the lady would be over    years old if she was still around   br    br   jeopardy  an mgm winner   

=======================================================================================================

982 ===> does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film  i love it  one of my top   films of all time . it just makes me feel good . i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over    bebe benson  michelle johnston  is the babe of the film  imho  i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film . the two are like apples and oranges . the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work . i believe it  s only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren  t changed more than they are . this is a very good film  it is very satisfying . that  s all you need to know   

=======================================================================================================

983 ===> a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non  heroes plan to sell to  the iranians .  low  rent video nonsense by the producers of  silk stalkings  offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged  drama  . . . a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects  although the final twists and allegiance shifts could  ve been a nifty end to a better movie . burt still has presence  although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half  baked  one  liners  .  

=======================================================================================================

984 ===> about three minutes into this thing i started fast  forwarding  pausing only during the nudity  why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women   . in ten minutes i was done  and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store . the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa . come on writers  the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy  s remote control  that  s the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire  also  to add insult to injury  the  twist  at the end was so formulaic  that it could have come from any action movie written in the past   years . burt reynolds was fine  but he should concentrate on real movies .  br    br   this movie is just a waste of time  run away  run away   

=======================================================================================================

985 ===> when i really began to be interested in movies  at the age of eleven  i had a big list of  must see  films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts . i remember one of the films on that list was  a chorus line  and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come true .  br    br   of course  i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there . i mean  take  a chorus line   a stage play turned into film . i know it  s something we see a lot nowadays  but back then it was a little different  apparently and this film has something special .  br    br   most of the musicals made movies today  take the chance the camera gives them for free  to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places  a chorus line  was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie . following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach  michael douglas   richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job .  br    br   everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing  the stress of having to learn the numbers  the silent competition between the dancersand it all occurs on the stage  where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences . there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic  but they list shortens as the hours go by .  br    br   like a movie i saw recently   a prairie home companion   the broadcast of a radio show  atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity . on or behind the stage  things are going on  and time doesn  t seem to stop . again  i don  t if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this  but it sure doesn  t look like it and anyway it  s a great directing and editing  john bloom  work . but in that little stage  what you wonder is what to do with the camerawith only one setting  ronnie taylor  s cinematography finds the way  making close  ups to certain characters  zooming in and out  showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york .  br    br   in one crucial moment  douglas tells the ones that are left  before we start eliminating you  re all terrific and i  d like to hire you all but i can  t  . this made me think about reality shows today  where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving  even when they are not good  . it  s hard  you must imagine at least here  where all of them really are terrific .  br    br   to tell some of the stories  the characters use songs and  in one second  the stage takes a new life and it literally is  a dream come true  . the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws  showing these dancers  feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett . the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman which is very touching at times . so if it  s not with a song it will be with a word but in  a chorus line   it  s impossible not to be moved .  br    br   during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition  cassie  a special dancer played by alyson reed  takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it . the words  let me dance for you  never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics .  

=======================================================================================================

986 ===> i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway . i love the broadway musical and i love the movie . i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show . i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies  so i developed a philosophy really early . assume that the movie is going to be based on the book  or musical in this case  but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same  it will be different so watch it for what it is .  br    br   i danced for   years before i had to make a choice . i was a good dancer  picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc  but i wasn  t super talented . i was however super talented as a show rider . i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer  who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state  that i had to make a choice when i turned   . that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four  five days a week and riding  hours a day  days a week . . and dedicate to one or the other . so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies . i just chose to watch this movie for what it is  it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction . it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it . i love the movie . i love the broadway musical .  

=======================================================================================================

987 ===> don  t get fooled with all the big names like burt reynolds  james woods and anne archer . they are just glorified extra  s . their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so . whatever their motives for being in this movie  if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him . to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through . the plot itself wasn  t that bad . and the acting from most of the actors was above average . cuba gooding jr . however was terrible . he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes . and since this was meant as a serious movie that can  t be a good thing . the action scenes were not bad  but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting . again better direction was needed . also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this . it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action . for an action thriller of only   minutes that is far too slow . the only redeeming factor is angie harmon . she does her best to make it all work . too bad the director left her hanging . yes  this movie could have been much better with a great director . andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off . and for an action  stunt coordinator of his caliber you  d expect at least more exciting action scenes . don  t waste your time with this one . avoid   

=======================================================================================================

988 ===> this movie had some great actors in it  unfortunately they had forgotten how to act . i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start . it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time . maybe it was the musical score or the director himself  but one thing is for sure the make  up artist needs to get another job  the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces  would not recommend this movie to anyone  no wonder it never hit the theaters . cuba gooding jr .  james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all . the plot was great just needed a whole lot more .  

=======================================================================================================

989 ===> this movie will always be a broadway and movie classic  as long as there are still people who sing  dance  and act .  

=======================================================================================================

990 ===> this show is so full of action  and everything needed to make an awsome show . . but best of all . . . it actually has a plot  unlike some of those new reality shows . . .  . it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base . . i totally suggest bying the dvds  i  ve already preordered them . . . i suggest you do to . . .  

=======================================================================================================

991 ===> i saw  paris je t  aime  because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him . going in  i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really regretted wasting  hours of my life sitting through this tepid production . the  stories  are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful . what do gena rowlands and ben gazzara have to do with paris  the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably non  french feel . the clichs about paris were endless . yes  most of them were playing with clichs about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clichs  they directly and regrettably promoted them once more . yes  paris is the city of love . we get it .  br    br   the worst segments were the one directed by wes craven  oscar wilde   the one with nick nolte the mime one  the worst    the hair products one the one with juliette binoche  willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris    the vampire one  when i think of paris i think of elijah wood  . the one with natalie portman  which really looked like a mentos commercial and it was stupid  the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him  . on and on it went . it felt endless .  br    br   i didn  t like the coen bros one as well . it really plays with those parisien clichs but i didn  t find it funny . just annoying . the gus van sant one was interesting but it was so slight  and the punchline was obvious  that it barely registered .  br    br   there were only two  successful  segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman . nice irony there . and the segment about the african who is stabbed . it  s the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris . the story could have taken place in any city around the world .  br    br   the last segment  the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad . they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescending .  br    br   the whole project felt forced and uninspired . almost like the french government sponsored this film to promote tourism . all in all  with only about   to   minutes of interesting stuff   paris je t  aime  was an awful cinematic experience .  

=======================================================================================================

992 ===> flat characters that you do not and never will care about . cringe  inducing dialogue at places . no twists  they think they have one  but if you didn  t figure it out after about   mins you  re not too bright  . lots of well know actors in roles and performances that  fortunately for everyone involved  will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll .  br    br   i don  t mind  slow  movies  but they  ve got to be going  somewhere  . this one doesn  t .  br    br   the plot wasn  t what made this a direct  to  dvd movie  that  s just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy .  br    br   the as  of  writing      ten     ratings must be from people involved with the production .  

=======================================================================================================

993 ===> i love this movie . i mean the story may not be the best  but the dancing most certainly makes up for it . you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them . i just think that you won  t like this movie unless you  re into broadway . . .  

=======================================================================================================

994 ===> anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly  i would refer them to roger ebert  s review of this movie . he is one of the most respected critics in the industry  and he gave it     stars .  br    br   this is a great movie . it may not be perfect  or spectacular  but i enjoyed it . a chorus line is not so much a story  as it is a group of stories about the lives of broadway hopefuls . i read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between zach and cassie . that is an incorrect view . it is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the broadway hopefuls . what people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through . and that i think is really the point of the whole show . it is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers  but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general . this is a study of life as a broadway star . anyone who has dreamed of becoming a broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through .  br    br   this is a great musical . it has its slow points  and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines  but all in all  i thoroughly enjoyed it . take a closer look at the movie  and then maybe you will understand what i am talking about .  

=======================================================================================================

995 ===> it had all the clichs of movies of this type and no substance . the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it . the production was good however  the script and acting were b  movie quality . the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors . the good actors didn  t hold their own nor did they lift up the others .  br    br   this movie is not worthy of more words  but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines . james wood and cuba gooding  jr . play caricatures of themselves in other movies .  br    br   if you are looking for mindless entertainment  i still wouldn  t recommend this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

996 ===> this movie was like a bad indie with a  list talent . the plot was silly  all the way to the end . it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the      s . i would have given it a one  but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile . i think the worst thing was the underwater scene  s held off of the dock . the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were  and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air  this air tank would kind of appear . i would avoid this  unless there is nothing else on the shelf . good day .  

=======================================================================================================

997 ===> i don  t agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the american international pictures . basil deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war england  but without the sentimentality of  blackboard jungle   . the cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate . the estate looked like an old prison . stanley baker was excellent as the hardened detective  reassigned to the juvenile division   urgent  urgent  larceny  five iced lollies      he finds he is the butt of many jokes . david mccallum showed that he was one of britain  s top young talents of the fifties .  he had a very different role in another stanley baker film  hell drivers   . his portrayal of johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening . ann heywood was also very good as the cynical cathie . i wouldn  t say there was a romantic subplot in it .  br    br   detective jack truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the  firefly  . just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough  he is assigned to the juvenile division  he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work . amid all the heckling he gets his first call out  the  year old murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops     br    br   taking the twins home he meets their brother  the charismatic johnny  and their embittered sister cathie . he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals . as he gets more involved with the family  he realises there is a strong link between the fires  johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry . the local priest  peter cushing in an unusual role  away from the hammer horrors  explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero . he wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires . the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children  s fear  the teacher  thinking only of her own safety  runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman      br    br   i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war .  br    br   highly recommended .

998 ===> i  ve long wanted to see this film  being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum . i agree that the romantic sub  plot was a waste of time  but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role . thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week . i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war  especially with the way things were throughout the     s . some of the boys are a bit scary . i certainly wouldn  t want to met them on a well  lit street  much less a dark one . there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well  or as they call him  a firefly .

999 ===> you have to figure that when the star  s name is listed wrong in the opening credits  you are not in for a good time  the credit reads  cuba gooding  j . r .   . some nice car chase  shoot  em up  blow  em up action if all you want is action  because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best  and completely unbelievable . the motivations of the characters  especially that of gooding  s at the end  are worse then unbelievable  they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled . all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project  he can  t have something on all of them  can he   .  

=======================================================================================================

1000 ===> camera work  why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy  this is annoying and distracting . editing  the flashes of the still pictures were way too short . many of the other scenes were too short also . just flashes . sound  the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices . one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said . doesn  t anybody check these things and make them do it over again . please reduce the volume of the background music in future . is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor  julia wong  the plot had way too many loose ends . the basic story line had potential . i think the film needed more work . was it rushed  perhaps they ran out of money . like a lot of movies  it started out great but just petered out toward the end . i really don  t understand this  you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn  t all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard .  br    br   sorry to be so critical .  

=======================================================================================================

1001 ===> this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society  rather than being a lucid parody of     s teenage life . in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpool  s junior liaison officers the opening title points out that    of potential delinquents  who have been dealt with under this scheme  have not committed a second crime . however  this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen  drama until the film  s epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn  t feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed  up they might seem .  br    br   stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer . this hard  boiled character is a role typical of baker . having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer . however  as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events  back to his original investigation .  br    br   his first case leads him to the home of two young children  mary and patrick murphy  played by real  life brother and sister duo   who have committed a petty theft . here he meets cathie  satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood  their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with . it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner  city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency .  br    br   the elder brother of the murphy family  johnny  is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums . mccallum does an eye  catching turn as the americanized mixed  up kid  who owes more to the likes of marlon brando  than any previous british star . one is reminded of brando  s character johnny from  the wild one  who led a leather  clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film  s  johnny  leads his gang .  br    br   thankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as  the blue lamp  is not so apparent . instead we are presented with several well drawn  out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefront .  br    br   the plot  whilst at times predictable  does deliver some memorable scenes . the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music  leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant . the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children  including mary and patrick  are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny . obviously in the light of the real  life dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying . understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences .  

=======================================================================================================

1002 ===> one of the comedies of the      s . also has the best signature tune of any comedy show . the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred . the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing . a man and two women . richard o  sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox . its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success .  br    br   the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and richard  s frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm . the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early      s but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements .  

=======================================================================================================

1003 ===> this movie looked good  good cast  evergreen topic and an explosive opening . it went downhill from there . why was it filmed by hand held camera  it shakes  judders  part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer . a poor choice indeed . as if this was not enough  the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer  mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all . and then it commits the worst sin of all . after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion  they roll credits without revealing the denouement  the ending  the payoff  like what the heck was the motive  how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending  doh  this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud . what a waste of effort . poor effort by writer and director .  

=======================================================================================================

1004 ===> i didn  t expect a movie as good as  in the line of fire  or an episode of      but it looked like this movie was made for tv and did a mediocre job at best . the  good  cast couldn  t disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle  they really try their best i think  through their lines of bad script  giving their rather flat characters any extras . when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other  better  movies . in it you had car chases  big shootouts  romance  plot twists etc . etc this movie has none .  br    br    spoiler as soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to cuba  s character  you know who  s behind all this and all the hints you  re being given   you stand too close to the president  see it from my perspective . .   sound silly .  br    br   if it were up to me  and maybe it  s a good thing that it isn  t  i would rewrite the plot like this  br    br   first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to cuba all the time .  

=======================================================================================================

1005 ===> like a lot of series pilots  dark angel  s opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet . not that this is unusual in any way  but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more . in today  s world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation  the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused  with all guns blazing .  br    br   the ninety  minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together  and both episodes have a problem with focus . in the first half  we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her . we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win bets  interacting with a pi  or sorting out co  workers  domestic problems . the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes  on television or otherwise .  br    br   it  s when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus . throughout the two halves  max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time . in the second half  the repercussions catch up with him  and max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess . this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series  and it works  but it doesn  t quite click if you get my meaning . it  s like most of the pieces are there  but a couple that make a complete image have been left out . perhaps they get filled in with later episodes  but that  s beside the point . the fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty  eight less minutes .  br    br   the last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing . original cindy in particular is an annoyance  and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes . while the acting isn  t as bad as daytime soap  it isn  t of such quality that i  d commend it . jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world  but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least .  br    br   the good news is that the premise and the production values are all top  notch . in fact  this series was considered quite expensive to produce  and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn  t last a whole season . especially when there was ample time for both shows  they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality tv . the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel  where imagination rather than overhype  are used to draw the attention .  br    br   in all  i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten . it never rises above the level of throwaway television  and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time . but the potential is there  and that  s often all that matters where pilots are concerned .

1006 ===> as is nearly always the case  when britain comes up with an entertaining and  or successful sit  com or quiz show  the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own  grossly inferior  version . man about the house is  of course  no exception to that rule . the yanks  version  three  s company  was unwatchable  braindead pap that seem to run forever . a prime example of quantity over  non  existent  quality . the original  on the other hand  is a fondly  remembered gem that had the savvy  like fawlty towers  to pull the plug at precisely the right time  unlike the    episodes of  hilarity  that three  s company came up with  . jo was cute  there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers  richard o  sullivan made it all look so easy  the scripts  whilst not exactly oscar wilde  standard  were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop  dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell .  nuff said .  

=======================================================================================================

1007 ===> spoilers ahead  br    br   this is one of the worst movies ever made  it  s that simple . there is not one redeeming quality about this movie . the first   minutes are quite tricky  they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat . instead  you will spend   minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization . the lake was ridiculous  looked like an aquarium  and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed . characters show their advanced teleportation powers  for example alex thomas who falls into the lake  drunk   and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position . angie harmon put up a pitiful performance as kate  made worse by the space  time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader . an example of this would be when she said   flashlight   in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half . finally  the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen . it was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists . an example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on alex  s car . i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie . the ending was absolutely pathetic . the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say   oh yeah   instead  we  re left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line . unfortunately  there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap .  br    br   i give this a .  out of    the .  being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book .  

=======================================================================================================

1008 ===> how unfortunate  to have so many of my  a  list  and good  b  list actors agree to do this movie  but they did  and that is what sucked me into watching it . i had never heard of this movie  but there was cuba gooding jr . right on the dvd cover  and james woods in the background how bad can it be  in a word very  this movie starts o . k . has some twists and turns  then just lays an egg . the ending was so weak  it was as if the writer got called away and his  year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending . how ironic a for a movie titled  the end game  to have such a poor one . these are the types of movies that can move  a  list actors to the  b  list in hurry . i hope cuba gooding jr  and james woods don  t make a habit of this .

1009 ===> some years ago  satellite channel u . k . gold promoted repeats of  men behaving badly  with the hype  here it is  the original flat  sharing sitcom   . this was in fact untrue .  man about the house  was also a flat  sharing sitcom and ran from        .  br    br   it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke  creators of the popular sitcom  father dear father  . when it ended  they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times .  br    br   in the first episode  chrissy  paula wilcox  and jo  sally thomsett  are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath . he is robin tripp  richard o  sullivan   a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode . while his clothes dry out  he puts on a ladies  dressing gown and prepares them a meal . they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay . but there must be no naughty business . so robin has to pretend to be gay . . .  br    br   on b . b . c .    s  i love       shown in      julie burchill claimed that  house  showed her a way of life she envied . she was not alone . one of the most iconic  for me  anyway  images of     s british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol  and a  blind  man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past .  br    br   a man living with two girls was a risqu subject for the time  but mrs . mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar  it was innocent  good  natured fun . mortimer and cooke  s scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it .  br    br   richard o  sullivan was still playing  bingham  in i . t . v .  s  doctor in charge  when this got started . in fact the second run of  in charge  overlapped with the first of  house  . he was born to play the sex  mad robin . paula wilcox  s  chrissy  was more streetwise than  beryl   her character she played in  the lovers   while sally thomsett  s  jo  was a lovable dizzy blonde . as time wore on  he became almost like an older brother to them .  br    br   for many viewers  brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers . george had lost interest in sex  but mildred had not . they went on to their own show  the aptly titled  george  mildred  . the late doug fisher was good value as as robin  s wideboy friend larry . he worked so well he was made into a regular .  br    br   within a year of its debut  there was the inevitable movie spin  off . i am not a big fan of the  man about the house  movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen . most of its characters had never appeared in the series .  br    br   the format was sold to america  where it became the long  running  three  s company  starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers . it was far more suggestive than the british original  with somers often seen in sexy clothing .  br    br   after six seasons   house  ended with chrissy marrying robin  s older brother norman  norman eshley  . fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved  but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show   robin  s nest  .

1010 ===> this is a better than average silent movie and it  s still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents . however  if you aren  t yet a fan of the genre  i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one . that  s because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots . but  despite this  it  s still a good film and kept my interest .  br    br   a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him . the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief . despite this  she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life . however  the rent is due and there  s no money  so the lady is forced to look for work . she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal . unfortunately  the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can  t make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man  s date . well  like cinderella  she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her  what to do now   given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her   well  see the movie yourself to see how it  s all resolved . i didn  t like how they handled the husband  as it seemed awfully predictable and clichd . however  once he was out of the way  i do admire how the film also didn  t give up a by  the  numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends .  br    br   all in all  a very good film worth seeing  but certainly not great .  

=======================================================================================================

1011 ===> some guy gets whacked . right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him . he  s got some bodyguards and they whack the killer  but a reporter gets interested . she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked . she walks in  and corners one bodyguard  but he doesn  t feel like talking . i can  t figure out why . it  s not like anyone else is interested . she  s the only reporter there . anyway  her editor discourages her from working on this lame story . but hey  she does anyway . she goes to see the killer  s sister  mom . a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time   somebody blows up their trailer   huge ball of fire . then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital . she finds him hungover on his boat  but a minute later they  re both underwater sucking on a scuba tank  cause three guys are trying to whack them  and have blown up the boat big time   huge ball of fire  . the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them .  br    br   in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street  there  s a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse  some car chases with wreckage  death  a fake suicide  etc . etc . lotsa stiffs  all kindsa carnage .  br    br   great stuff  but what the reporter and the bodyguard can  t figure is why in hell the original guy got whacked . what  s the motivation  of course  it might help us to figure out why the reporter  s even interested . through almost all of this she  s the only reporter on the story . nobody else in the media cares . not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies . true  the original guy who got whacked wasn  t exactly a celebrity . his job was a little bit dull . he was just the president . yeah  the one who lives in the white house . oh  and the bodyguard is a secret service agent .  br    br   is that the spoiler   br    br   it should be . after all there are no tv cameras  no other print reporters  no bloggers . . . just another one of those police blotter crimes . . .  br    br   so what  s the spoiler   br    br   lemme think . . .  br    br   no  wait  the spoiler is that his wife did it  yeah . . . the first lady . she was p    ed because the president was fooling around . and she gets away with it . she  s really sharp  huh  but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out  why would anyone bother  after all  only one reporter is even interested .  br    br   i give this move a    . it was so dumb i just had to keep watching . and it only got dumber  that  s the real spoiler  but even though i  ve told you  you  ve got to see it to believe it   

=======================================================================================================

1012 ===> this movie was craptacular . i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies  biggest antagonist was  in fact  myself . i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away  but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto  magically transform into something engrossing along the way . even in this state  i couldn  t help but notice that cuba  s acting was as flimsy as tracing paper . his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards . burt came on the screen as a general  that  s right  a general  who wears too much makeup  . i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cuba  s  except mine was real and i stubbed my toe . recompense  recompense my stubbed toe   

=======================================================================================================

1013 ===> this film has a clear storyline  which is quite unusual to the musical genre .  cats    phantom of the opera   and other andrew lloyd webber  s musicals can be considered metaphorical  as they use literary works as their framework .  biarkan bintang menari   bbm   s storyline touches the very core of human relationships  especially that of indonesian people . despite the fact the film was based on a  supposedly  fairytale  it  s actually a fantasy of the  child  in indonesian adults . the dance sequences are not perfect  yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves . i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing  by not dismaying the fact that indonesia  s dance development tends to be more westernized . the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and  or music . yet  i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future .  

=======================================================================================================

1014 ===> and i am a nicole kidman fanatic . i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book  which  for all i know  she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie .  br    br   all four of the principals are excellent  but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing .  br    br   while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie  this one asks too much of the viewer .  br    br   it could have been very funny  which it is in parts  or quite frightening  which it is in one scene  but the director didn  t seem to know which way to go .  

=======================================================================================================

1015 ===> please  help the economy  spend your money elsewhere  the synopsis of the movie is the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her . that  s it . undetected by anyone  except cuba and angie  she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about . . . and gets away completely free .  br    br   some specific points are particularly hilarious while standing in front of the president  cuba a deflects the assassin  s bullet . . . which then enters the back of the president  s head .  br    br   cuba and angie watch film from a news camera  and they see . . . a clue . they go to great lengths to protect the film  believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film .  br    br   cuba speaks with a presidential staff member . the psm comments that there was no conspiracy . cuba claims there was more than one person involved . the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi  the cia  and the nsa . gosh  i wonder is the psm is involved .  br    br   ms archer  the first lady  is a craptacular artist . cuba can  t make out a painting  and she says   you  re too close . . . stand back . . . look from a different perspective  look from my perspective .  can anyone miss that clue   

=======================================================================================================

1016 ===> end game started well  the least said about the end the better . it seemed like things we  re happening just to keep the plot going  for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive  intelligent person  half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character  we are given no reason for this apart from  the next scene wouldn  t make sense without it . the whole story could have been told in about   minutes  it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr . is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering .  br    br   the end game was honestly one of the worst films i  ve ever seen . . . . . . and that  s saying something  i  ve seen gigli .  

=======================================================================================================

1017 ===> i didn  t really know what to expect when going out to watch the film  apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet . that and it had nicole kidman in it . i absolutely loved the film though  and came out thinking  wow  .  br    br   refreshingly down to earth  the film moves along nicely  with a few suprises at each corner . the relationships in the film are believeable  with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully . the humour is subtle  with some great  office   like scenes at the bank  and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood .  br    br   overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation . it  s less about heroics and more about delicate relationships . brit  filmmaking at its best . . .  br    br          

=======================================================================================================

1018 ===> as usual  hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie . but  this one is a classic  from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman   well done . even facial expressions were great  language was perfect  even in russian language  and nicole did a splendid job   hey guys  you get what you pay for   

=======================================================================================================

1019 ===> cuba gooding jr . is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the u . s . president  i  ll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for  and this film shows us why . he teams up with a persistent news reporter  angie harmon  to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president  s death  and so on  blah  blah  blah .  br    br   even with a cast of james woods  cuba gooding jr  anne archer and angie harmon  end game  fails to grab your attention  plain and simple some of the action is good  the acting isn  t all bad and the story although clichd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie  well it doesn  t  the writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that  at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters .  br    br       it  s boring  predictable and dull .

1020 ===> my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory . however  of the   pages of reviews  only a handful are negative . i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future .  br    br   i admit  i  m more inspired to write reviews when i don  t like a movie than as to when i do  so my handful of reviews are all negative . still  that doesn  t mean i  m biased towards not enjoying a movie  but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy .  br    br   paris je t  aime is the most pretentious movie i  ve seen in years . by using an  intelligent  concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories  the movie ends up the worst of all worlds . it is art for arts sake  but something that a  year old could dream up and accomplish . giving the director free reign of  minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment . directors can  t write  writers can  t direct .  i  d like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated  but that is because he  s an actor turn director which rarely works  either  .  br    br   what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don  t make any sense  are not completed in  minutes and in total  spoil paris to me . why call it paris je t  aime when a more apropos title is cluster fck  there are only a couple stories that are watchable  most notably the piece by alfonso cuarn  but everything else will fall into obscurity . the coen brothers short is passable  but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar  it  s as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it . as we all love paris  present company included  we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks . in fact  i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their  minutes . seriously . seriously .  br    br   people  natalie portman is not a good actress . she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours . and maggie gyllenhaal  why    are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies  i  m looking at you natalie portman  garden state  closer   elijah wood  sin city  and catalina sandino moreno  maria full of grace  .  br    br   one final comment on the acting i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again . find his short on youtube as his  minutes are quite enjoyable .  br    br   writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right . i  m thinking of ernst hemingway  raymond carver  f . scott fitzgerald  and john cheever  just to name a few . it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this . the same can be said about short films . it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history .  br    br   if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story  then don  t expect to enjoy this movie at all . the directors either didn  t care or were lazy . in either scenario  by the time you are reading this it means you rented it . praise be that you didn  t pay   dollars a head in theaters for it .  

=======================================================================================================

1021 ===> excellent movie  albeit slightly predictable . i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie . some of her other works haven  t shown the amazing talent this woman has  but birthday girl doesn  t suffer from this in the slightest . even without words kidmans acting shines through .  

=======================================================================================================

1022 ===> i caught this on the dish last night . i liked the movie . i traveled to russia  different times  adopting our  kids  . i can  t put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing  bad  turn  good  and  good  turn  semi  bad  . i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie . like  i can  t belive this is happening to me  whether it  s good or bad it the same look  and it works  . great ending .     . rent it or catch it on the dish like i did .  

=======================================================================================================

1023 ===> i argued with myself whether to rent this or not . i  m always afraid of renting something i  ve never heard of  don  t remember this being in theaters  . great cast . . . that  s what tipped the scales .   minutes in  i almost stopped watching it . the first few minutes are fun to watch  but unbelievable . it only gets worse after that . the writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better . or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable . i give it a  . . . . a  for the writing  only because there are words  and a  for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script . oh my god this movie sucks .  

=======================================================================================================

1024 ===> poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy  tired of the hollywood glamor treatment . first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli  an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress . and now it  s europa    another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment .  br    br   nor does the story do much for alexander knox  in another thankless role as her long  suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son . at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than stromboli .  br    br   bergman is still attractive here  but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman . she  s never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son  despite attempts by a kindly male friend .  sometimes i think i  m going out of my mind   she tells her husband . a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace  but it does give us a sense of where the story is going .  br    br   bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post  war rome  but being a social worker with poor children doesn  t improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse .  br    br   the film  s overall effect is that it  s not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman . the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she  s two  timing him . the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street  walker through her terminal illness . the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum .  br    br   ingrid suffers nobly through it all  over  compensating for the loss of her son  but it  s no use . not one of her best flicks  to put it mildly .  br    br   trivia note if she wanted neo  realism with mental illness  she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak   it would have done more for her career than europa   .  br    br   summing up another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman .

1025 ===> this is a great little film  that  s very unique  and creative  with some great plot twists and wonderful performances  . all the characters are great  and the story while bizarre  is fascinating and very interesting  plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this  . it  s very hard to describe this movie  because it really is quite bizarre  it  s a comedy  romance  one minute then it turns into a thriller the next  however it was still very entertaining all the same  plus nicole  s russian accent was fantastic  and extremely convincing . chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together  and i loved vincent cassel  s performance   plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise  . the ending was very cute  and it  s unpredictable throughout   plus this movie is quite underrated as well  . you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed  and i thought all the characters were really likable  plus the finale is especially good . this is nicole  s movie though  and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance  . this is a great little film  that  s very unique  and creative  with some great plot twists and wonderful performances   i highly recommend this one  . the direction is very good  . jez butterworth does a very good job here  with great camera work  solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace  . the acting is wonderful  . nicole kidman  is stunningly gorgeous   and is amazing as always  she is incredibly sexy  very likable  had one of the coolest accents  added a lot of presence  had very good chemistry with ben chaplin  and had a very mysterious character   she was amazing .  kidman rules      . ben chaplin is great here  he is extremely likable  had a cool character  had very good chemistry with kidman  the only thing i didn  t like was him taking out his anger out on kidman  even though what she did was wrong  and i loved how he got revenge in the end  . vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain  yes he was ott  but he was very intense and quite creepy at times  this role was perfect for him . mathieu kassovitz is ok here  but didn  t have much to do . rest of the cast are fine . overall i highly recommend this one  .     out of

1026 ===> i  ve had a lot of experience with women in russia  and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like  unfortunately . they are very cunning  ruthless  and greedy  as well as highly unfair . from the robotic sex  the hustling for gifts  to the lies and betrayal  i  ve experienced it all in russia .  br    br   i know what i  m talking about . and here are my qualifications here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride . it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met  black comedy  scams i was privy to  and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv .  br    br   http   www . happierabroad . com  photojournals . htm  br    br   it  s like reality tv . you will love it . i spent a ton of time putting it together . so check it out . the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals .  br    br   my  bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell  so why don  t they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia  however  there is one factual impossibility in this film  and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport . it doesn  t work that way at all  so i don  t understand why the media likes to perpetuate this . there isn  t a single russian bride introduction website that works this way  and i challenge anyone to find one that does . the fact is  you can only order the russian lady  s contact info  email  address  phone number  etc .  from the website . from there  you correspond and then visit her  and if you want to bring her to your country  you start the immigration process at your ins office  and wait months after that . that  s how it works in real life . you can  t just order her to arrive at your airport . us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen .  br    br   wumaster  br    br    i got everything i wanted by going abroad  you can too  http   www . happierabroad . com  

=======================================================================================================

1027 ===> i checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page . it is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dud . . the only mystery here is how oscar winner f . murray abraham got involved with such a lousy script   

=======================================================================================================

1028 ===>  . . . ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet  and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was . and i couldn  t have been more agree about it . then after that i saw this film on dvd  i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv . luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap . i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn  t make me satisfy . so i can  t be judging on how the film was made  but anyway . . . it still sucks . as for those who liked this film  i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is . i don  t know what do you think about this film   

=======================================================================================================

1029 ===> every time i see nicole i like her more . i love a movie like this . a woman you just won  t give up on  but she keeps breaking your heart . first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage  the kim novak  laurence harvey version . the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty  it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can  t speak russian  i  m sure . funny how people miss the point . the no  goodnik russian guys were well cast too . finally  i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin  as somebody else noted  he plays a sap with great dignity  and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole . to think  guys get paid for that  mind  blowing .  

=======================================================================================================

1030 ===> modern  original  romantic story .  br    br   very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin .  br    br   miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent . ben chaplin is also good as the shy  dull clerk . for the men  and some women   miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic . i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is . it  s not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her . some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense . although i hoped for a happy ending  the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me .  br    br   conclusion  good movie .  br    br   les pays  bas  huit points .  

=======================================================================================================

1031 ===> first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston sturges . sturges was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired . however  it wasn  t the preston sturges  it was preston sturges  jr . the story was essentially based on robert louis stevenson  s short story  the bottle imp  . a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell . that  s fine . nobody said screenwriters had to be original . the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen . my biggest complaint comes with the ending . the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person . at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film  they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film . this is a stupid convention . the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end . there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think . you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end . in fact  i think it  s preferable .  

=======================================================================================================

1032 ===> the darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while f . murray abraham was in it . spoilers about halfway through  f . murray gets zapped  because the darkling is some kind of demon  like creature who enjoys living vicariously . he takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success . he feeds from their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins . however  part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil . otherwise he cannot  pervert  their natural goodness . that  s what the little guy said in his barry white voice  which i found both charming and amusing . mostly amusing . like imagine barry white if he were a little dwarf and he was telling aiden gillen  dee plane  dee plane  bos  here eet come  dee plane   all through the movie  dee dwarf  actually a robotronic cherub  talks to aiden gillen in the barry white voice  saying things like  it  s ok to be bad  you know you want it .   now you  ve committed murder  you  re really moving up in the world  and other remarks that sound like commercials for  being evil  stores or something . it really is hilarious in a sick way .  br    br   anyhow  aiden gillen is no f . murray abraham  and the movie tanks as soon as murray gets the axe  or knifed   . f . murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film . he is a good actor . aiden gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face  and he looks like maybe his remedial english comp . class had never hit the mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about . the ending is really creepy and yet almost comical . if this movie were a parody  the ending was perfect . if it was not a parody  then it was creepy but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross  out that the movie itself could not deliver . the people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending . it just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending .  

=======================================================================================================

1033 ===> when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could  only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it . i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control  with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment   imho . thus for instance  dogville  even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home  or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else  s attention  or other pet causes of kidman  s .  br    br   here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job . i don  t how or who was able to restrain her  but apparently it worked . the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman . and consequently  what makes a man  s most desperate hopes marginally attainable .  br    br   of course  the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy  but his transformation is adequately believable . it isn  t coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego . instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances .  br    br   also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human  apart from their criminal mission . her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture . and while they are his adversaries  they are never really his enemy . in effect  they teach him to be compete .  br    br   i really marveled at kidman  s ability to physically appear russian . it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian  but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it . maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing .  br    br   i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film . despite my gratuitous digs at ms . kidman  the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime .  

=======================================================================================================

1034 ===> i bought dark angel seasons    two weeks ago  after catching a couple of season  episodes on channel  . nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is . i haven  t enjoyed anything as much since firefly  also and amazing show  . i  ll admit season  wqasn  t quite as good  but there are still some amazing episodes  see designate this  bag  em  the berrisford agenda  harbor lights  freak nation etc .  and alec is great . i  ve heard some of the plans for the would  be season   and i have to say  i can  t believe it was cancelled  i won  t spoil it for you  but it would have rocked  i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie  although at the moment it seems highly unlikely  . as proof of my obsessiveness  max  s barcode number is              and in the two weeks i  ve had it  i am  episodes away from having watched both seasons twice . it  s just too good .  

=======================================================================================================

1035 ===> i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival . most of the audience  including my wife  enjoyed this comedy  drama  but i didn  t . it stars lucas haas  brick  alpha dog   molly parker  kissed  the five senses  hollywoodland  and adam scott  first snow  art school confidential  . the director is matt bissonnette  who  s married to molly parker . all three actors do a fine job in this movie about  friends  the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third . it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful . the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama  and i thought it needed to be the other way around .  

=======================================================================================================

1036 ===>   st watched           out of    dir  brad sykes   mindless   d movie about flesh  eating zombies in a  story within a movie chronicle . and yes  we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in  d   wow  not   that has been done time and time again in  d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh  eating . that  s what made the original zombie classics good . the flesh  eating was just thrown in as an extra . we  re actually bored throughout most of this   part chronicle because of the lame  twilight  zone like  easily understood and slow  pacingly revealed finale  s . the last story is actually the story the movie started with  having a reporter investigating a so  called ghost town  and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie  s in that one as well . well  i think i  ve said enough . watch the classics  not this  d bore  feast .  

=======================================================================================================

1037 ===> this is a comedy based on national stereotypes  no doubt . if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are  if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions  you can have fun with this film . nicole kidman is at her best  sexy  moving and funny . ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out  shadowed by nicole  and the rest of the cast does good work as well . the final is moving  and logical  movie logics  of course . worth watching  if you accept the rules of the game .  

=======================================================================================================

1038 ===> the critics didn  t like this film . it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain . which was a great shame  because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain first .  br    br   nicole kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian . ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from  the graduate   and  birthday girl  has at least  scenes which remind the viewer of that     s classic  despite being a totally different story   .  br    br   sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure  but it  s memorable  moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega  budget blockbuster .  br    br   see it with an open mind   

=======================================================================================================

1039 ===> merry madcaps in london stage a treasure hunt  with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong  independent lady  flier who  s never been in love . intriguing early vehicle for katharine hepburn  playing an amelia earhart  like aviatrix who  s been too self  involved to give herself over to any man . the director  dorothy arzner  and the screenwriter  zoe akins  who adapted gilbert frankau  s book  were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view  but why are all the old clichs kept intact like frozen artifacts  billie burke plays the type of simpering  weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong  and hepburn  s final scene is another bummer . a curious artifact  but not a classic for kate  watchers .  from   

=======================================================================================================

1040 ===> dialogue stilted  clichd acting hammy  clichd plot predictable  clichd .  br    br   just what are christopher plummer nastassia kinski doing in this  b  rubbish  plummer was well established decades before this movie was made  kinski had masterpieces like  tess  and  cat people  behind her . . . must have been desperate .  br    br   the bad guys all have bad  guy accents  bad bad  guy accents   plummer especially  where did he learn to do  german    and most of them have bad  guy sneers as well . the innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh . the good guy survives  amongst other things  a   throwing knife buried hilt  deep in his shoulder  just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all  marines  machine  gun fire  i think someone referred to a .    in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp  several fist  fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium  first into a door frame  a fall  backwards  from what looks like the third floor  onto paving  without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience . the script has exactly  clever lines  the rest of the time it  s all so dull and boring .  br    br   ok it  s not all bad . plummer does bring a certain class to his part  and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick . of course that doesn  t say much  but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here . he delivers his  ve haff vays and meance  type lines with some menace  but you are always aware you are watching christopher plummer acting the villain .  br    br   this movie is truly an awful waste of time . the acting  such as it is  is sort of    s    movies wooden line delivery meets bruce lee  s very obviously faked fight scenes  but it  s not even anywhere near as good as either a roger moore    or a bruce lee film . don  t bother .  

=======================================================================================================

1041 ===> this film is definitely an odd love story . though this film may not be much to shout about  nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten  though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans  hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area . what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series  heartbeat  soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick . nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends  up as fairly decent weekend entertainment . a good one to watch  and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character .  

=======================================================================================================

1042 ===> are you a giraffe  . . . ask john to nadia  and she  sure of responding well  responds him yes . in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don  t know each other  and at the same time  the questions and doubts in  birthday girl  . a film that i heard a lot of times  but i don  t dare to see . . . until two hours of write this .  br    br    birthday girl  is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count  at the same time  that nicole kidman is one of the best actress  besides she is pretty and intelligent  that i have ever seen .  birthday girl  is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet . the woman that he finds comes from russia . she seems to be that delicate woman  normal  not more . one day  in her birthday comes suddenly  his cousin and his friend . the man  begin to discover certain things . since here  he don  t going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been .  br    br   much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot . much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don  t novel . but  birthday girl  is just the opposite . this movie is full of good surprises  good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined . this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind .  birthday girl  have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes  but at the same time  certain touching nature  and makes it so deeper .  br    br    birthday girl  is sometimes sad  sometimes funny  sometimes violent  but at the end  is totally satisfactory . and i  m not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece .  br    br   sorry for the mistakes . . . well  if there any .  

=======================================================================================================

1043 ===> it  s die hard meets cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it  s up to one cop  jack  crackerjack  to stop this .  br    br   a b  action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action  a ridiculous plot  as always in these movies  and three fine stars . thomas ian griffith as the cop and nastasja kinski and christopher plummer as terrorists . if you don  t like stupid b  action movies this is not for you .

1044 ===> maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun  check  isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen  check  tasty looking love interest  check  assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents  check  german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion  check  corny one liners  check   br    br   deary me  does this film take the wee wee or what  the clichs come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is   br    br   in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain  complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid  we have all the usual action move clich  s ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off .  br    br   jack wild is the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point .  br    br   in amidst this mess  there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and  or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects .  br    br   looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels  i have got to find these gems on dvd  it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege  and the second sequel  well goodness knows  one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character  s name seems to change for the third instalment .  br    br   still  blind purchases of cheap dvd  s just would not be the same if studios didn  t keep trotting out material of this awful quality

1045 ===> this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching . the story is engaging and it doesn  t take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention . the acting is first class and the characters are represented well . sometimes it feels like the director couldn  t decide himself between drama and romantic comedy . ben chiller  s portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn s . m . magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs  as does the look in nicole kidman  s eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time . . . other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant .  

=======================================================================================================

1046 ===> for a film that got little publicity  and few people have heard about  this was pretty good . it  s another one of these modern  day british crime films that are quirky   snatch    sexy beast   etc .  . it  s not wild like  snatch  but it  s interesting and it has some rough characters .  br    br   it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show  not late  has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first  time viewer . basically  it  s about a low  key british male who sends away for a russian  mail order bride  who winds up  with the aid of two russian male friends  providing a couple of big surprises .  br    br   ben chapin and nicole kidman co  star  and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman  s russian cohorts . this is a different kind of film and well  acted . kidman once again proves she  s far more than just a beautiful face .  

=======================================================================================================

1047 ===> where to start  this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen . the editing is the worst ever  the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked . most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects  with muddled talking in the background . i had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on . . . . and what was i supposed to hear exactly  probably one of the worst scripts ever made . i can  t believe people actually put up some green for this film . it makes me think i could take a crap in a box  send it to producers  and then have them finance a movie for me .  br    br   dolph  was a usual  dolph . nothing else needs to be said . the villains were bad  the protagonists were bad  and the movie was a stinker . if you really want to know what not to do when either writing  directing or editing a movie  watch this   

=======================================================================================================

1048 ===> this movie had the potential to be really good  considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci  fi actioner the hidden . and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles . but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one .  br    br   dolph plays a butt  kicking monk    who travels to new york to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for     years . he must battle the minion  who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell . the minion  naturally  wants the key so it can let the antichrist out . along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and dolph are chased by the minion  possessed bodies .  br    br   if i  m making this sound entertaining  forget it . the pacing is very awkward and sluggish  the acting subpar at best  and the fight scenes staged poorly . dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career .  br    br   the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine  gun wielding monks at the monastery  but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest .  br    br   too bad  i really wanted to like this .  

=======================================================================================================

1049 ===> this movie really woke me up  like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber .  br    br   this guy john  ben chaplin  leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town  until the stunningly gorgeous  wild  girl  to  die  for nadia  nicole kidman   ordered by email from russia  enters his life to become his beloved wife  by johns plan . however a glitch turns up  nadia does not speak a word of johns language . although calm and emotionless on the outside  john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service  he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process .  br    br   what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently  paid safe  feeling clerk into a decision  making decently thinking action figure  giving the viewer a subliminal message  you would have probably acted likewise  .  br    br   kidman  cassel  kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing   almost  only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues  however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right . nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles  at least from the cultural background .  br    br   the pace of the film is fast and captivating  and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear  you rather feel that you  re in the middle of the plot  and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out .  br    br   my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy . to sum it up  it has an unusual plot  great acting  and ideas below the surface . like the idea of the  rude awakening  from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society  s machine  the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings   welcome to the machine    . i bet that in the end  john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all .  br    br   thank you  writers  for the great story  and everyone else for this great movie  please make a sequel  and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever  because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the   .     percent of the potential viewers  i am sure of it .  

=======================================================================================================

1050 ===> jessica alba  s max and valerie rae miller  s original cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial . wonderfully politically incorrect . quality varies greatly from episode to episode  but generally the standard is high and when it is not  jessica is always worth looking at . valerie  s urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory .  

=======================================================================================================

1051 ===> i have seen some bad movies  austin powers  the spy who shagged me  batman forever   but this film is so awful  so boring  that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest . a pity . boasting talent such as kenneth branagh  embeth davitz and robert duvall and a story by john grisham  what went wrong  branagh is a big  time lawyer who has a one  night fling with davitz . her father  duvall  is a psychopath who hanged her cat  etc  etc  so branagh has him sent to a nuthouse  and he promptly escapes . somehow  i couldn  t figure out how  robert downey jr  daryl hannah  famke janssen and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary . i wanted to like this  and  being a huge grisham fan  have read all about this movie and i  foolishly  expected something interesting . this is honestly the worst film i  ve seen to date and i wish i could have my money refunded .  out of  .  

=======================================================================================================

1052 ===> dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti  christ is found by an archaeologist  of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn  t killed so easily as he transfers from body to body .  like fallen without the suspense  of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable . i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren  like steven seagal and jean  claude van damme  i try to watch his movies whenever they  re on tv . i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed . this movie is utterly terrible . with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena . worst of all is lundgren  s woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest    all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen  which was good  and end of days  which was bad but better than this  overall this movie is the worst movie i  ve seen from dolph lundgren . it literally has nothing to recommend it . it  s awful and it  s the lowest point in lundgren  s career . and i saw cover  up  the last warrior and masters of the universe .  br    br       out of    awful   

=======================================================================================================

1053 ===> i would highly recommend this movie  and i certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad  it was with excited anticipation  that i have just pre  ordered it online  i enjoyed it so much  it is not out until february  march      but it will be well worth the wait  but first go and see it in the cinema if you can . there is nothing quite like the cinema  experience of a cinema  made movie  insist that your local cinema puts it on  i went to see  seachd  the inaccessible pinacle  tonight  down here in london  and was really impressed . it is a marvel a truly beautiful film set in the scottish highlands you will laugh  you will cry  you will be moved in may different ways  you will be intrigued  and as the story within the stories is revealed  you will be amazed at that revelation .  br    br   this movie is in scottish gaelic with english subtitles  but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the gaelic i am just starting  and my son does not  nor did many people there tonight  and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means  superlatives do not suffice  the photography is superb  there is no cgi here  and the movie is all the better for that  here you have true photography  the script is so skilfully and subtly written . the many  layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers . the music is at times rousing  at times haunting  but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance . and the acting  . . . it is to behold . . . and the actors  . . . they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film  particularly the two main actors   padruig  the  young  and  padruig  the  elder   a true bard  if ever there was    who both carried a very heavy load  and the direction  well watch out richard  and the producer  responsible for raising funding  hiring key personnel  and arranging for distributors  a task well done  i hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad  and the gaelic community  uill  without you it could not have happened  we were told that this movie was made on a low budget  but you would not know it  and i think it might well be because  for what they might have lacked in money  they more than made up for with the richness of the heart  and the warmth and co  operation of the local scottish gaelic community .  br    br   a heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making  and the sponsoring  of  seachd   mran taing   many thanks   from the gaels to the world  from the world to the gaels   

=======================================================================================================

1054 ===> this movie is best described or compare to  big fish   the movie by tim burton  . but it  s a less glamorous and more in you face tale . and of course here it  s not the father  but his grandfather who tells the stories .  br    br   the movie  s narrative also moves back and forth  so the story outline here at imdb  might tell you more than you would like to read  before watching the movie  . it  s funny and engaging enough  even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too . it also surprises you here and there  with things you wouldn  t expect . a nice little movie then  that deserves your attention  especially if you like movies like that  o   

=======================================================================================================

1055 ===> this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever  i emphasize  ever made . whats worse  my old hero dolph is in it and hes starring it . jesus . . . the story is actually quite good but the way its carried out made even my body hurt . the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter . the actors  except for dolph who kinda sucks also  perform so badly you cant help but wonder if their reason for being there is that theyre all friends of the director  who by the way must have been absent most  if not all  of the time . this is    million spent in an unimaginable way  because by the look of the effects and scenery  the cost cant be a cent above      .  

=======================================================================================================

1056 ===> come on  let  s get real . the knights of christ  ordo templi  or the knights templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early   th century . the story is so laughable that it  s pathetic . dolph lundgren just looked positively bored . and besides  if you wanted to have a real  life templar  why not just use the knights of christ  who are still in existence in portugal . at least they should have taken history into account . the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces . the acting was bad  the storyline appalling  the action horrible  and the props were okay .  

=======================================================================================================

1057 ===> the scots excel at storytelling . the traditional sort . many years after the event  i can still see in my mind  s eye an elderly lady  my friend  s mother  retelling the battle of culloden . she makes the characters come alive . her passion is that of an eye  witness . one to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she lives .  br    br   of course  it happened many years before she was born  but you wouldn  t guess from the way she tells it . the same story is told in bars the length and breadth of scotland . as i discussed it with a friend one night in mallaig  a local cut in to give his version . the discussion continued to closing time .  br    br   stories passed down like this become part of our being . who doesn  t remember the stories our parents told us when we were children  they become our invisible world . and  as we grow older  they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir . fact and fiction blend with aspiration  role models . warning stories . archetypes . magic and mystery .  br    br    my name is aonghas  like my grandfather and his grandfather before him .  our protagonist introduces himself to us . and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations . it produces stories within stories . stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of scotland  its rugged mountains shrouded in mists . the stuff of legend . yet seach  d is rooted in reality . this is what gives it its special charm . it has a rough beauty and authenticity  tempered with some of the finest gaelic singing you will ever hear .  br    br   aonghas  angus  visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death . he burns with frustration . part of him yearns to be in the twenty  first century  to hang out in glasgow . but he is raised on the western shores among a gaelic  speaking community .  br    br   yet there is a deeper conflict within him . he yearns to know the truth . the truth behind his grandfather  s ancient stories . where does fiction end  and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents .  br    br   he is pulled to make a last fateful journey  to the summit of one of scotland  s most inaccessible mountains . can the truth be told  or is it all in stories   br    br   in this story about stories  we revisit bloody battles  poisoned lovers  the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth . in doing so  we each connect with angus  as he lives the story of his own life .  br    br   seachd the inaccessible pinnacle is probably the most honest  unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made . like angus  i got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories . but  also like angus  i forgave this once i saw the  bigger picture .  forget the box  office pastiche of braveheart and its like . you might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of the wicker man . to see a film that is true to scotland  this one is probably unique . if you maybe meditate on it deeply enough  you might even re  evaluate the power of storytelling  and the age  old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced .

1058 ===> teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast . she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada . finally someone has the sense to create a show for her . the supporting case seems quite good too . i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing . though  i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show     .  i might be wrong  but as far as i am aware  the show was conceptualized in     and appeared on global tv in canada in early     . it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well . too bad this couldn  t be paired up with corner gas . now i know corner gas is on ctv  but the two shows would be great companion pieces .  

=======================================================================================================

1059 ===> what happened  what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast  but somewhere the movie loses it . actually  it never really got going . there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant  then find out that she is after all  but that was it . steve martin  who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie  was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie  other than to make it longer . i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters  kate and angie  and maybe try not for a pure comedy  which unfortunately it was not  but maybe a drama with comedic elements . i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot .  

=======================================================================================================

1060 ===> near the closing stages of baby mama  one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it  was all just a mess   i really couldn  t say it any better than that . and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again  the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone  s time . a lacklustre cast  mundane script and vague  caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn  t taxing on the ol  noggin  but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour . consisting mainly of very routine  clich jokes based around an odd couple  rich and poor  trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world  the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic .  br    br   as a story on finding love  it  s not that bad  but playing this plot line as a side  story of sorts to work alongside the comedy  orientated odd couple tangent  characterisation is notably weak  resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles . as characters themselves  both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces  but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the character  s interactions with each other amusing at times  the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we don  t feel for the characters and don  t find them inherently interesting  but rather their dynamic . unfortunately however  although this dynamic works best  or at least better than the individual personas  as mentioned above  it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd  couple formula .  br    br   kate  tina fey  is a successful business woman who has hired working class  dumb  blonde angie  amy poehler  to be her unlikely surrogate  and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl  dax shepard   both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences . yes  it  s the typical odd  couple premise  and one that we have already seen in this year  s what happens in vegas  yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi  layered characters . kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air . in fact  the movie  s only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door  man . of the few times that i laughed during baby mama  most of those moments were because of this man  and the remainder usually fell to shepard .  br    br   it  s a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script  s themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera  and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough . yet  for a film about babies  multi  million dollar business and cultural stereotyping  this isn  t necessarily a good thing . baby mama is grade  a  hammy  plastic tinsel  town with capital bore topped with sugar . so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two  dimensional nature  but i simply didn  t care for the world they inhabited . the dialogue  along with sets  costumes  and the script  s general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director  s incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these aren  t characters and that isn  t our world in any way so why should i care  at the end of the day however  a romantic comedy  s ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests  and the frequency of its laughs baby mama has little going on in any of these departments . of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair . i  m sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings  but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored . in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable  but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch  baby mama is too light  headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining .  br    br    a review by jamie robert ward  http   www . invocus . net   

=======================================================================================================

1061 ===> excellent show . instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it  s the same old thing  just different  stars   this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations . we have been away from watching any television for  years and after coming back  of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on w . shame on global for pulling the plug on this one . i thought this one would be a winner . let  s be realistic about things  few canadian shows make it . everyone i talk to enjoys this show and i believe it was foolish of global to walk away . i guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the states instead of pulling behind a canadian made show that had a lot of promise . don  t get me wrong  i enjoy a lot of shows on tv  but  come on people  let  s keep the variety . this unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships  with unique characters that you don  t see on any sitcoms today or in the past . too bad that global had to say no to this one  foolish mistake .  

=======================================================================================================

1062 ===> spacecamp is my favorite movie . it is a great story and also inspires others .  br    br   the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie . it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie .  br    br   the   th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up . i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot .  br    br   i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach .  br    br   i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up . i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers   invisible   going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result  so i  m much closer to the accident and any movie similarities . i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later  strangely enough  on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in     and who later built endeavour .  

=======================================================================================================

1063 ===> come on tina fey you can do better then this . as soon as the movie started i knew how it would end . sure it was funny at times . even laugh out loud funny . but there isn  t enough laughs to save this movie . i don  t recommend buying this . at the most i recommend renting it but thats all . baby mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for .  br    br   tina fey and amy poalher made a good team . mean girls is one of my favorite movies . tina fey and amy poalher both did great in that and they do good in this . but this isn  t there best . baby mama had a great supporting cast . dane cook  sigourney weaver and steve martin add to the casts greatness .  br    br   another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world . after the great knocked up and juno  baby mama looks very average when compared . knocked up and juno are hilarious  heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face . baby mama  s ending was unfunny and dull .  br    br   baby mama wasn  t the best comedy of the year and it doesn  t try to be . i recommend it but don  t expect it to be totally hilarious . expect a average comedy that doesn  t give the big emotional ending it tries to have . i give baby mama . . . . .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

1064 ===> i wouldn  t say this totally sucked  but if it wasn  t for netflix i wouldn  t even have this in my house . steve martin  s eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat . he  s just not funny . he  s another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie . the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original . amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a  minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately . the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes . the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn  t get pregnant . the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts  but it seems to simple simmer along  not really entertaining or creating laughs .  

=======================================================================================================

1065 ===> definitely needed a little work in season  . such as the virus between max and logan  and ames white along with his ancient  super cult . during season two  however  the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max . very good drama in season two . but of course like all tv shows  if there  s something a little wrong with it  the broadcasting company takes it off the air . i was seriously hoping for a third and final season . season  leaves you hanging  unless you read the books by max allan collins  then you will know what happens .  br    br   dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again . since jessica alba  s carrier sky rocketed after the show . if that would be the case  then there should be a movie to complete it . just like the show firefly  which of course fox canceled as well .  

=======================================================================================================

1066 ===> hurrah  a space film that doesn  t take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp . the film starts slowly  the usual mix of idiots and high  fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup . but when the going gets tough  the tough get themselves sorted out and it  s not an un  believable change in the characters as you can believe that there  s some responsibility in their young minds .  br    br   the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the  i  m right and you  re all wrong  instructor . i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a  vote .  

=======================================================================================================

1067 ===> i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless . an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas  the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man . they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or  duh  burn him . quentin alias mr . fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame  who is unhappy in marriage . wow  love plot . the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid . the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film . where is the mummy  really just a curse unleashed . this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least . watch this movie if you need sleep  because you will dose off .  

=======================================================================================================

1068 ===> an expedition led by hunky captain storm  mark dana  travels to the valley of the kings in cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition . they meet beautiful mysterious simira  ziva rodann  who joins them . they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy . . . and only simira seems to know what  s going on .  br    br   a real snoozer . i caught this on late night tv when i was about   . it put me to sleep  seeing it again all these years later i can see why . it  s slow  moving  the mummy doesn  t even show up until   minutes in  and this is only   minutes long    the acting ranges from bad  dana  to real bad  george n . neise  and there  s no violence or blood to be found . this movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics  involving a silly love triangle  than horror .  br    br   this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good  everyone plays it straight  there  s some good acting from diane brewster  it  s short and the mummy attack scenes  all three of them  aren  t bad . they  re not scary just mildly creepy . still  this movie is pretty bad . a sure fire cure for insomnia .

1069 ===> spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love  and mom and dad can have fun watching as well . growing up in the    s i enjoyed this movie  it  s plot and all the actors . i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own  they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did . the plot is fun  a group of kids  embark on a journey they never expected  when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot . they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn  t have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in . once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life .  

=======================================================================================================

1070 ===> i  ve been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too . some of the users are stuck in a  realist  type of mentality . this film was meant to be a  fantasy  . . . . a  what if  fun film . it was never meant to be  real  or serious . it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out  even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion . . . i was   at the time and totally enjoyed this one  my young son loved it too  later  i shared it with my daughter and she  too  loved it . spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that  fun . all the  realists  in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film . so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp  one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california   they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt  letdown  . . . i guess their parents didn  t explain the difference between fantasy and reality . oh well . if you love fantasy  fun films and haven  t seen this one  i highly recommend it  enjoy   

=======================================================================================================

1071 ===> the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb . the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy . one by one  the blood is drained from those involved in the dig .  br    br   to be as brief as possible  pharaoh  s curse is quite the lackluster affair . while the movie does present a few good  original ideas  blood sucking mummy  s  soul transference  interesting make  up effects  the arm ripping scene  etc .  and a few atmospheric moments  the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding . to make matters even worse  the first   of the film  s relatively short   minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding . i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies  but pharaoh  s curse tests even my patients . the cast helps very little . with only one exception  ziva rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character   the cast is as dull as the screenplay . finally  i don  t know whose idea it was to put the mummy  looking servant in what appears to be pajamas  but it  s a laughable  ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience .  br    br   despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh  s curse  i  m going to rate it a     . not a good rating to be sure  but generous given all the problems i have with the movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1072 ===> this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad . . . hence  can i advice anyone to watch it  well  i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition  i still can  t believe it won  . . and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a qa section . . but that was also anything but interesting . . what  s it about  well the first half  the worth watching one  presents three characters a hooker  a musician and some kind of official . . the first two lie about their professions . . but the third is the actual liar . . the second half  do something else . . don  t ruin a good evening  includes some old breasts and heavy drinking . . but maybe you will see it completely different . . . the tiff jury did  were they drinking vodka    

=======================================================================================================

1073 ===> space camp is a pretty decent film . the plot is predictable  but the actors do a good job  and the special effects are decent for the time .  br    br   this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster  and that really put a hamper on how popular it was .  br    br   the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular . . . on the big screen  that is . . . on a tv . . . it just looks average . i remember this scene in the theater . it made you feel like you were really up there .  br    br   this would be a good film to see on imax  but i  m sure that will never happen .  

=======================================================================================================

1074 ===> to my surprise i quite enjoyed  spacecamp   i remember seeing it about   years ago  and recently i hired it again . i was quite impressed . obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp . however  this film had a story  a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it . but thats what i liked about it  they don  t make films like this anymore  so it was a refreshing change . it was interesting to see kelly preston  leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles  with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light  fluffy plot . absolutely loved the robot named jinx  it was very cute  but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters . the film was almost inspirational in its own way  and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama  i think  .  

=======================================================================================================

1075 ===> i agree with the previous comment  the beginning of the movie is quite good  and get  s you wandering about what is to come . . . . . . . which is nothing . all open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture  save for  or  very short scenes . i wander if ilya wouldn  t have done better to just completely leave them out . . . . as for the one remaining character  nothing is done with her either . she just visits some god  awful place  and suddenly the movie isn  t about her anymore  but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread  drinking homemade vodka  and apparently flashing each other . some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling  like the judges of the iffr  but for me it is just bad taste  bad camera  work  a lousy script and frightfully bad direction . therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading    

=======================================================================================================

1076 ===> the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour . it starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good  funny story is to come . well  i can tell you it will not come . it will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness .  br    br   in an interview i heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that  according to him  the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience . i was amazed to hear that . am i living in the same world he lives in  ok a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all  but that doesn  t make me feel like i am losing my identity . what does khrzhanosvky think  that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch  am i shortsighted or is he   br    br   well my vote the good start of the movie saves it from getting a   a decent  is my conclusion .  

=======================================================================================================

1077 ===> the perfect space fantasy film . a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down  but do they  sure they do . this would not be a family film if they all died . then it will all be sad . you don  t want that kate capsaw  the leading lady gives a golden globe performance  but sadly  she nor lea thompson won one . that sucks so bad . i can  t say it enough  this film is so great  lea thompson  o lord  a perfect girl for this film . this film is the best for sure .  br    br   sorry  but better than star wars . star wars is so over  rated and space camp was so under  rated . it should of been the other way around  br    br   excellent        r maybe      . iam not good at math  

=======================================================================================================

1078 ===> a few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot . and the oxygen in ship was running short . they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks  etc  etc .  br    br   first of all  this movie  s plot is not possible in real life . but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in .  br    br   it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years .  i saw this movie for the first time in the year of      it was filmed in      there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood .  br    br   the view was great from outer space . it does not look unreal . it is about  hours long  it runs so fast that you won  t even notice . you know that it is not real  but you just get sucked into it until the end .  br    br   overall  it is a good family movie .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1079 ===> let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more  most   open  minded movie  viewers . . . movies are my passion  and i am a big regular at my local cult  movie  rental  place . . . i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there  and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult  movie  area . . . i love to rent strange stuff  and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult  movie  video  place . he told me he thought i had to see this  and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky  one of my favorites   atmosphere  i rented it .  br    br   the vote i gave here is not really fair  because i did not think it was awful  i just did not know how to rate it otherwise . a question mark would have been more appropriate . . .  br    br   this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach i actually felt physically ill  am i the only one whose stomach literally turned  still i did not want to turn it off  or maybe i just couldn  t because i was fascinated in a nasty way . . .  br    br   i do not ever wanna see this movie again .  br    br   not awful  a  as i said . just not my cup of tea  or wodka for that matter  . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1080 ===> the first hour of the movie was boring as hell . there is no suspense  no action  not even a plot . the movie went no where . i mean they could have made the movie in   min short film . overall  the movie wasn  t good at all  and i don  t recommend it .  

=======================================================================================================

1081 ===> unfortunately  spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion . which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should  bring it out . i  m glad they did . i first watched spacecamp at a drive  in movie . which really enhanced the viewing a lot .  br    br   while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt . i had never heard of the others in the movie . so  it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting  and acting real good  of course  kate capshaw was excellent too .  br    br   i especially liked the scenes  where those kids were being shown how to act  as a team . the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for . the actual launch of a spacecraft  is of course  old news to us . however  this one was different .  br    br   all in all  this is one of my most treasured films . escapist maybe  but it was fantastic for a space nut like me . after probably renting it for      times . i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it . now  if it only comes out on dvd . i will probably have it forever . this movie gets a  out of   from me .  

=======================================================================================================

1082 ===> i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch .  br    br   they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team .  br    br   another scene is like during their failure at the simulation  kevin gets joaquin to clam down .  br    br   i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff .  br    br   otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff .  br    br   the dvd i have watched feels edited for television .  

=======================================================================================================

1083 ===> the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute  s return to her home village for the funeral of a sister  friend . there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken  but they are not fully explored . the core of the movie is the funeral  wake  and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable . apparently  the movie is unedited . the prostitute  s journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud . maybe that  s supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape . the village itself  such as it is  is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male  the consort of the dead girl . continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible . most of the film is shot with a hand  held camera that could induce nausea . another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don  t include the songs and laments of the crones . don  t go to this movie unless you  re fluent in russian .  

=======================================================================================================

1084 ===> the russian movie      follows the lives of three  not four  strangers who meet one night in a local bar . one is a musician  one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl .  br    br       i gather  is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post  soviet russia  the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are   but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it . there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes  operating secret cloning facilities  selling decades  old frozen meat etc .  but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody  s really up to here .  br    br   despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes     is a two  hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs .  

=======================================================================================================

1085 ===> watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories . i  m   now  have not seen it since i was      . i had almost forgotten about this movie  but when i watched it again recently  some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye  that little robot  jinx   friends for ever   . it was just like revisiting my childhood . it was an absolutely amazing experience for me . i will always cherish this movie for that reason . i hope some of you readers can relate to my experience  not for this particular movie  but any movie you have not seen in a long while . very nostalgic . . .  br    br    thanks for reading  

=======================================================================================================

1086 ===> wow   br    br   this film is the best living testament  i think  of what happened on        in nyc  compared to anything shown by the major media outlets .  br    br   those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside . this film shows you what happened on the inside .  br    br   it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman  waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight . the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers . you are then given a front  row seat as firefighters rush to the scene  into the lobby of tower one .  br    br   in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane  and tower two  s subsequent fall  you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby . it is a sight you will not soon forget .  br    br   heart  rending  tear  jerking  and very compelling from the first minute to the last        deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made .  br    br   we must never forget .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1087 ===> i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie . i guess i must have missed something . the beginning is intriguing  the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories . that  s the best part . after the three go their separate ways  the film splits into three threads . that  s when boredom sets in . certainly  the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity . unfortunately  the director beat this one to death  even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular . bottom line a two  hour plot  thin listlessness . if you suffer from insomnia  view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep .  

=======================================================================================================

1088 ===> perhaps being a former moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the  arthouse  festival crap  trashcan . it  s not the greatest film of      nor is it complete garbage . it just has a lot of problems . i also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any  ideological fears   or  conservative taboos  or any other reason this movie might conversely be called  courageous  and  uncompromising  abroad . it was banned because the censors knew    of the russian film  goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film .  br    br   so we have a strong opening shot . wonderful sound design  excellent premise  laden with meaning and symbolism . the usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film  s strongest aspects  not that the number  is a daunting visual challenge  . over the next   minutes we have an equally strong setup . an amusing and well  written bar conversation among the   main   characters  and we feel pathos for these people  the great country of russia  the human condition and all that . then the movie starts slowing down . we begin to wonder what  yawn  lies ahead .  br    br   the rest is quite boring  simply put . sure  the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings  and there are some slightly amusing moments . nice sound  sure . but the enjoyment of this movie  not to mention the plot  are seriously compromised by the pacing problems . and this  this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the  nicely  shot  abject misery and bleakness  is what ultimately will make people angry at the  offensive  stuff  personally  the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing  in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear  .  br    br   if you want to watch an enjoyable movie where russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time  the entire film   watch particulars of the national hunt . much more rewarding post  soviet stuff . so yeah  a  out of   for   nice and symbolic of my post  mediocre  film condition .  

=======================================================================================================

1089 ===> these two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive . this is definitely a movie about survival  but not without it  s touching moments .  br    br   the finest piece of work i have seen documenting the        tragedy of new york city .  

=======================================================================================================

1090 ===> if i didn  t know any better  it almost seems like it was staged  but it wasn  t . it was set up perfectly  and how they got all of that footage is amazing  the unfortunate events of september        are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic . just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september   .  

=======================================================================================================

1091 ===> i saw the film at the belgrade film festival last week  and i  m still working off the trauma . essentially my view seems to match a number of others  the first half hour was fresh  sharp  deep  entertaining and promising . well acted too . natural . my problem  however  is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning  nor the fact that i spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp  grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken  toothless  bread  chewing hags . it  s rather with the fact that they never warned me    the festival brochure synopsis described only the  utterly intriguing  sounding  first half hour  a whore  piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar  pretending to be an advertising agent  genetic engineer  and petty government administration official  respectively  making no mention whatsoever of the never  ending gum  smacking to come . serves me right for not reading the reviews  you might say  but to my defense  a number of reviews i looked at post  fact um didn  t at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film .  br    br   the first hint should have been the introductory words by the director  a bashful  tousle  haired russian youth  who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium  the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically  and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening  though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come  judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour  and many exasperated comments on exit  to say the following  well  i . . . um  thank you very much for coming to see this film  and i just wanted to say . . . well  it  s a very long film . . . it took me four years to make it  and . . . it  s . . i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it . it is very long . thank you for coming .  this is what he said . alarm bells should have been ringing .  what  s he talking about   i thought in happy confusion .  this is gonna be fun   of course  by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me  it was far too late to get out . all i could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again . and in the end i can  t say i feel in any way improved by the experience . yes  i absolutely loved the first half hour . it was intelligent  new  and had a lot to say . and yes  russia is probably in a bad state . yes  every society has many hidden faces . yes  toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard . yes yes yes . i get all of this . really i do . but i see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out  and so painful to bear . if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging  try the korean  chinese bin jip    iron  . it  s artsy and surprising  but also to  the  point and fun .  

=======================================================================================================

1092 ===> this was a blind buy used dvd . it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit play .  br    br   it  s bubble  headed comedy  but it  s um . squalid . the plot is zany   but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watch .  br    br   maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven  goofy caper film .  i know  i know  the quotes on the box  the academy award nomination mean nothing .   

=======================================================================================================

1093 ===> amazing documentary . saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years . i was shocked that it wasn  t even nominated for a best documentary oscar for      the year it was released . no other documentary even comes close .  br    br   it was on tv recently for the  th anniversary  but i missed the added  where are they now  segment at the end  except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unit .  br    br   i  ve seen criticism on documentary film  making from a few on this list . i can  t see how this could have been done any different . they had less than  months to assemble this and get it on the air . the dvd contains more material and background .  br    br   i  m also surprised that according to imdb . com  the brother have had no projects in the four years since . what have they been doing   

=======================================================================================================

1094 ===> it took us a couple of episodes to  get into  dark angel as a story and a series  since we were transitioning from the sopranos  a very different mentality framework . but  once we got with the gist of the series  we were very quickly hooked . it  s a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category dark angelwas much more than your average tv series . it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes  but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to  mutants  reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face  and make  everyday . that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti  discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces  hence not ruining the  fun  for those who don  t like to be lectured during entertainment   but every event and human  societal interaction remains relevant to the present . we all make judgments  face our own prejudices  but  in the end  the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it  or do you get up and do something about it  for those who have no choice but to fight  for survival or justice  this series empowers them . for those who  ve never had to face the question  this series  sneaks in  that message under the guise of pure action entertainment . it is much more well  made and well  written than most tv series i  m highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear .  

=======================================================================================================

1095 ===> i can  t believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie  the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot  and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending . but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i  ve ever wasted my time on . it  s just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh  s character around by his nose . the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer  which has been left out in the sun too long . the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham  movie ever and this isn  t changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie . don  t waste your time here   

=======================================================================================================

1096 ===> this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but  in my view  begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down . that this well  meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough  but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family  s life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories .  br    br   i found this movie average at best . art direction could have been much better  as could have been cinematography . the acting was good  and so was eva van der gucht  s singing .  

=======================================================================================================

1097 ===> the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did  they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened . they were in building    when you could see papers drifting down  people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height .  br    br   i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running  their camera was still running  when the white dust covered them  they found a shop doorway and got inside  but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us .  br    br   ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every     so i  ll never forget what this country went through . i believe if i remember right  it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters  while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral .  

=======================================================================================================

1098 ===> difficult film to comment on  how do you say it  s bad  well it isn  t  but then it  s equally difficult to say it is good . what it is  is compelling viewing  it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there . it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life  you know you want to turn away but you have to watch .  br    br   the naudet brothers handle the commentary very well  even in the most tragic of circumstances  there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults . the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on .  br    br   you can  t change history  and you should not want  this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour .  

=======================================================================================================

1099 ===> i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago . what a disaster . the acting was atrocious . there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon . this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn  t ring true . supposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original  lifeboat  . i think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it . from what i was able to suffer through  there is nothing compelling in this movie . it boasts a few semi big names  but they put no effort into their characters . but  you know  to be fair  it was nobody  s fault really . i mean  i  m pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion . lol . it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along . but for me  i  m not willing to spend at least three days to find out . so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon  avoid this stinker

1100 ===> this film is really bad  with a script full of  memorable  lines and incredibly bad performances . the special effects are also bad  not the worst ones i have seen  either  and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it . just two short themes    seconds long or so  are repeated constantly throughout the whole film .  br    br   all in all  one of the worst films i have ever seen .  

=======================================================================================================

1101 ===> the events of september       do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers . in my view it would have been better to leave this out . i think the directors tried too hard  perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop . the comment of one of a policemen   this aint fing disneyworld  is apt .  br    br   nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events . the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times  no other footage from the day matches what they shot .  

=======================================================================================================

1102 ===> let me get the bad out of the way first  james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day . really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery .  br    br   that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes . i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september   th . it is a second home to me and i can  t help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city . this is the real deal  in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them . i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day . it is a shame that they didn  t use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory  it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was .  br    br   conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way .  

=======================================================================================================

1103 ===> boring  predictable  by  the  numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of  mindless  mayhem and gore to satisfy  mindless  genre fans . mostly it  s about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we don  t care an iota about  if that  s your thing  tune in .        

=======================================================================================================

1104 ===> who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i . gordon  s legendary bad trash  film  food of the gods   nobody  of course  but director damien lee thought it was a good idea  anyway  and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history .  gnaw  is a sequel in name only  as the setting moved to a typical late    s location  a university campus  and also the cheap  cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the    s . this script hangs together by clichs  awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other  and more successful  horror classics . neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing  experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor . due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists  the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus . following the good old tradition that spielberg  s  jaws  started  there  s an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere . during a hysterically grotesque climax  the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus  new sport complex   gnaw food of the gods   is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch  the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff  like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know it  s infested with rats   the acting is atrocious and there  s a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth  serum  i wonder what freud  s theory would be on that  there  s a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric . in case you just can  t get enough of this junk  there are quite a lot of creature  features revolving on mutated rats  like the italian schlock film  rats night of terror   the modest    s cult film  willard  and its lame sequel  ben   the      willard  remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat  movies by once  famous directors tibor ticaks   rats   and john lafia   the rats   . go nuts   

=======================================================================================================

1105 ===> gdon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters . what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september   .  br    br   having worked with james hanlon  s ladder company before  jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak  while gdon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened . an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules  and he pointed the camera up  seconds before the plane crashed into tower one .  br    br   jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers . the first thing he saw was two people on fire  something he refused to film . he stayed on site for the next several hours  filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there .  br    br   the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent  grizzly  and gory . but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse  and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored . the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one  on  one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis .  br    br   unlike a feature film of similar title  most of the money from dvd sales go to      related charities . very well made  emotional  moving  and completely devoid of political propaganda  is the best documentary of the sort to date .  

=======================================================================================================

1106 ===> i have to say that the events of     didn  t hit me until i saw this documentary . it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation . i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers . i was sick of hearing about it . when this was aired on tv a year and a day later  i was bawling my eyes out . it was the first time i had cried since the attack . i highly recommend this documentary . i am watching it now on tv   years later  and i am still crying over the tragedies . the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing . it was an accident  and look where it got them . these two brothers make me want to have been there to help .  

=======================================================================================================

1107 ===> nothing to say but wow  has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field  well this happens about   times in this movie  clearly the directors  favorite scare tactic  . in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking  hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film . shortly after he arrives to the field the  contestants show up and  although it is clearly at latest  in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute . after about   minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown  s history in which we see some of his previous victims . if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest . . her ribs go all the way to her neck  it was flat out disgusting . most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day . the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard . the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically .  br    br   definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field .  br    br   signed  the answer  

=======================================================================================================

1108 ===> this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen . here are the things that immediately jump out at me  . the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush . not scary whatsoever . news flash  if you are filming in the southern california area  big bear is only an hour away . they actually have trees there .  br    br    . the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced . every possible line in the movie was unoriginal  clich  or just plain stupid . for instance the name of the camp is  camp blood   lame   the name of the clown is  the killer clown   lame  . what is a clown doing in a forest anyway  was that the only mask they could find   . the last but certainly the least was the acting . absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled . a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting . worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph . it  s a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy  but she was not . also  and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me  was this tool who is supposed to be  athletic .  for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them . then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very  girl like  run  that he is quite far from athletic . oh and to the girl who played kat  good lord stop singing . that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself .  br    br   if for some reason you do see this movie  i would at least recommend watching the special features . the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story . in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending . apparently she hangs out with special kids .  

=======================================================================================================

1109 ===> dark angel rocks  the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off  me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode  takes like  days but it is worth it  it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me   

=======================================================================================================

1110 ===> incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september   th . intense  personal  and completely riveting      is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident  which kind of gives it an even greater appeal . up until that morning  filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team  concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman . out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup  jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center  and from there a simple documentary was no more .  br    br   viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero  as the amazing group of fire  fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster . without hesitation  naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it  s entire support crumbles around them . the raw fear of an unknown  impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside . nearly as memorable is older brother gideon  s candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed . by the time we get to see the second tower collapse  as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris  we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up  close footage captured .  br    br   obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event  though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document  only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage  even if it cost them their own safety .  br    br   after viewing      and seeing that it came out in      i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone  s recent rendition  the big budgeted world trade center . many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble  and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought      all but renders his film completely obsolete . not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day  but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again .  

=======================================================================================================

1111 ===> after some internet surfing  i found the  homefront  series on dvd at ioffer . com . before anyone gets excited  the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv   years ago . the resolution and quality are poor . the images look like you would expect old re  recorded video to look . although the commercials were edited out  the ending credits of each episode still have voice  over announcements for the segway into the abc news program  nightline   complete with the top news headlines from the early      s . even with the poor image quality  the shows were watch  able and the sound quality was fine .  br    br   to this show  s credit  the casting was nearly perfect . everyone was believable and really looked the part . their acting was also above average . the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler  most recently seen in the     remake of king kong  . the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets  especially the     s kitchens with vintage appliances and dcor . the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time . for example  conversations between characters were sometimes inter  cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes . the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations . that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case .  br    br   as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it   years ago . despite all the ingredients for a fine show  the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start . for one thing  the name of the show itself is totally misleading . when wwii ended in      there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a  homefront  either . curiously  the first episode of the show  homefront  begins in     after the war had ended . that  s like shooting the first episode of  gilligan  s island  showing the castaways being rescued . the whole premise of the show  s namesake is completely lost . i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no  the entire show takes place from     through     . additionally  this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late      s . by the third episode  it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left  wing political agenda . the show is set in river run ohio  near toledo . however  the show  s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio . part of the ensemble cast are dick williams  hattie winston and sterling macer jr . who portray the davis family . much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil  whites  to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable . the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over   years . we get it . we  re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis . the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show  as it was for  homefront  . the acting talents of williams  winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical  frightened  angry black family  . the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something . the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist  fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing  and leave it at that . devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid .  br    br   in yet another ridiculous plot line  the big boss of a local factory  ken jenkins  is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees . the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro  communist propaganda message to the viewer .  br    br   personally  i think this series had great potential . the writers could have easily placed the timeline in          as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working   hour days at war factories . of course the loss of brothers  sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama . the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en  route to europe or the pacific . the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless . but no  the writers of homefront  david assael and james grissom  completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots . instead  they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left  wing politics . it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage .  

=======================================================================================================

1112 ===> why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance  i want a refund . . . can i have my    back  while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen  nothing did happen . the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot  which was not really like the film . why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out  it was not very artistic . why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes  why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading  or was that the point  i felt like phantom love had no story at all  and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film .  

=======================================================================================================

1113 ===> this was the most visually stunning  moving  amazing and incredible story i  ve ever experienced . quite frankly  even those adjectives just cannot describe it . i can  t just choose one scene that stood out for me . i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims the reaction of people trapped in the elevator  who were unaware of what was going on  as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the onlookers and finally the silence .  br    br   on that day  and even now  i am reminded of star wars       . obi  wan says  i felt a great disturbance in the force  as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced .  it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description . there was truly a disturbance in the force .  br    br   this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance . the feelings are so incredibly visual . the anger  the frustration  the shock  the fear  the exhaustion  and the realization of its very magnitude . it  s all there . not a thing is missed .  br    br   this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy . not just because it documents     but because it is simply everything it should be .  br    br   if you plan to watch  be sure to grab a box of tissues . you  ll need them . i know that i did .  

=======================================================================================================

1114 ===> to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed  i disagree . this is an amazing documentary about a shocking day .  br    br   imdb asks us to rate this movie . i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made . the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable . we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened . they continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother  s safety . to judge whether it  s nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing  amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer . i just know that in   years  a class full of children will not know one without the other .  br    br   i submit a wholehearted   . this is why the art of filming was created  to capture the natural emotion that real life offers . you can keep your kung  fu junk . romance is cute . action will never reach this level . this movie       will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself . it didn  t have a sneak  peek . it didn  t have all of the blatant vanities that a lion  s share of the many movies on the many screens blare . it had class  composure  substance  and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world . it spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera . please consider this movie  as it itself proclaims  a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free  beautiful name of america .  br    br   how can you give anything less to a movie that shows  not embellishes  the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times . i love  the godfather  but       is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world . it is art without question or questions .  br    br   jf  

=======================================================================================================

1115 ===> del   you are the dumbest smart person i  ve ever met .   br    br   calvin   well  i had a brain  but they lost it in the re  writes .   br    br   i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov  s work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed . in the books  she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists  able to think her way through a problem . here she  s just a damsel in distress  waiting to be rescued by wil smith .  br    br   there are passing references to asimov  s laws of robotics  but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes .  br    br   smith is likable  as he is in most of his films  but honestly  the story isn  t that good . you figure it out long before these genius characters do .  

=======================================================================================================

1116 ===> waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand  i expected an interesting sci  fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot  technology  instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it  once more proving that stunning special effects can  t help a boring plot  which by my opinion was the worse in this year . acting in this movie also dissatisfied me  will smith didn  t show anything new in this movie  yet i never saw his acting to change since  men in black  which was his only success by my opinion . he had to retire since than  not spoiling his name with titles like  i  robot  and  men in black   .      

=======================================================================================================

1117 ===> great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time . . that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item . . what shocked me was not only the attacks  but the  high fat diet  and physical appearance of some of these firefighters . i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that  in the physical shape they were in  some of these firefighters would not of made it to the   th floor carrying over   lbs of gear . having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job . the french have a history of making great documentary  s and that is what this is  a great documentary . . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1118 ===> very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on   th september     . the main theme of it is the heroism of american fire  fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could . the film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing  many people seen on screen have lost their lives  recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

1119 ===> after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie  goers . there are the ones who are well read  extremely literate  and intelligent . they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author . for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature . considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre  pubescent teenagers . today  s well read fan knows well this history  and knows the great authors asimov  heinlein  bradbury  and ellison  who helped bring science fiction out of that basement . in doing so they created thought provoking  intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition . this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them . they are not critical for it  s own sake  but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye .  as they should as hollywood  s record has been less than stellar .  to these fans the story must take supreme importance . they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics  and non stop action sequences . when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest .  br    br   the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre .  look at many of the above comments that state  well i haven  t read the book or anything by this author . . .  their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel . they are extremely uncritical  willing to overlook huge plot holes  weak premises  and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects . they are  in effect  willing to turn off their critical thinking skills  or maybe they never had them   for the duration of the movie . case in point  i robot . while supposedly based on asimov  s short stories and named after one of his novels  it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations .  those of you that will run out and buy i  robot will be very much surprised  this movie isn  t even based on that story at all    br    br   the film has enormous plot holes  that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity . i won  t point them out . i won  t spoon feed you . you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself . the characters  which are named after many of asimov  s characters  do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories . the plot itself with all it  s action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for . his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds  not their fists  is vital to understanding his vision of the future . in short  other than the name  their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie . there will always be those uncritical  i . e . unthinking  who will state  the movie doesn  t have to be like the book . due to the medium  movies sometimes require that changes be made .  but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book  or books  from the start  what if all they took from the written work was the title  this begs the question why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it  s title on your vacuous piece of crap  save money and don  t buy the rights to the works . title it something else . don  t use the character  s names . believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism . in fact it won  t matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him . but it will upset those who read  who think  who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show .  br    br   i  robot  like much of hollywood  s take on the genre  pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago . hollywood could not do this alone . it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this .  

=======================================================================================================

1120 ===> i just saw this film on dvd last night  and decided to check out the reviews this morning . it seems that  i  robot  has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb  and given rise to a lot of insults and name  calling  too  .  br    br   i find this somewhat surprising  as this film is not great  or even good   but neither is it terrible  or even really bad  . what this film really is  is . . . depressing . depressing that the us film  goer population is so ready to lap up insipid  clichd re  heats  and acclaim them as spectacular new works . this film as  retread  written all over it  from the plot line  an uneasy mix of asimov and modern  day uber  action  to smith  s character  a smart  mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium   to the special effects  that borrowed from matrix and a few others  .  br    br    i  robot  is  sadly  quite possibly the perfect action movie for today  s audience superficial plot  insipidly snappy dialog  and lots and lots of adrenaline . smith is mediocre  but we already knew that  he seems to be hollywood  s latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis  . the story has lots of holes in it  of all sizes  but i don  t think most people drawn to this film are critically  minded enough to notice . perhaps a blockbuster by today  s standards  but very b  movie compared to true winners .

1121 ===>      is a classic example of cinema verite  a sort of realist documentary  in this case of new york firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history . it  s all tiny  unobtrusive  hand  held video cameras  often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming  and by the director  naudet  s hand frequently wiping the screen  .  br    br   in this film  you get to know most of the firemen  tony benatatos  the rookie  or  probie   in ny fireman vernacular   the fire chief joseph pfeiffer  who finds he  s lost his brother later on  and a few others . there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film  just to emphasise the personal  reflexive nature of the events . the build  up is quite dramatic and well  done  particularly the passing  out ceremony at the fire department  with a few useful swish  pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork  just like rob reiner  s a few good men  . tony looks proud .  br    br   the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen  which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of wtc  while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next  this is classic cinema verite . there is also the eery  haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside . it is then that an increasingly forlorn fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless  and this is before wtc  collapses . you have to give credit to naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment .  br    br   the sound of the neighbouring wtc  collapsing is so awfully sad  poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen . from the lobby  it looks  feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened . you hear an enormous rumbling  trembling maelstrom  like that of a giant  monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded  the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in wtc  are oblivious to this event . where is the communication   br    br   this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided  cues like  this really was a day like no other  or naudet  s frequently banal pronouncements like  you could see fear in everybody  s eyes  and  i knew tony was freaking out   the film is really just one long video diary . there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone . imagine this film blended with cctv footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day . the effect would be greater . you could even combine this story with that of mayor giuliani and  perhaps  the famous cornishman rick riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero .  br    br   i don  t see much of a propaganda element in this film  as some reviewers suggest . this film is no triumph of the will  by riefenstahl . some time later the firemen drape the american flag over a nearby  surviving building overlooking what has become ground zero . so what   br    br   there are also some moments of dubious camerawork for example  who is holding the camera when the two naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station  is it staged   br    br   there is an excellent finish  very much in the traditon of the excellent french director alain resnais  hiroshima mon amour   with two strips of light reflected in the water  shimmying .

1122 ===> it  s true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes . and none more so that september         a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism .  br    br   no  this documentary didn  t set out to be dwelling on the events leading to     . rather  the filmmakers  brothers gdon and jules naudet  set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter . they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training  and had handpicked their  proby   probation firefighter  to join them in an ny firehouse  home to ladder  and engine  . but their production was to develop and contain at that time  believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center .  br    br   i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming  and received a call at about    pm local time from my dad  who informed me of the above . few minutes later  he told me there was another  and that the wtc was under attack . by the time i arrived home  the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke  and to my horror  they collapsed  under an hour .  br    br   the filmmakers had two cameras running that day  one who had followed a team out on a routine call  and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it . we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc  where the first responders of firefighters  paramedics  and police had to make sense of what happened  and to quickly develop a plan of action . the other camera  held by the other brother  was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling  and along the journey  captured the many expressions of new yorkers  as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten .  br    br   peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder  and engine   which miraculously  did not suffer any casualty . but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil  as they struggle to come to terms with the event . through the events that unfold  we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs  to save lives .  br    br   we began with what the documentary was supposed to be  before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus  right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures . it  s not a film that is fabricated  and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary  and heavens  not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters  . it  s as close as you can get to that day  witnessing the event up close  from safety .  br    br   code  dvd contains a separate extra hour of  sets of interviews with the men of ladder  and engine  .  

=======================================================================================================

1123 ===> in spite of the great future  design touches  the clever asimov premise  and will smith  s dependable cool performance  this movie doesn  t live up to expectations . the clichs come thick and fast  waking from a recurring nightmare  maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant  to list more would be spoiling it  you can see the end a mile off  . this movie is also stagebound  you never feel that you have travelled anywhere what  s supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago . the robots themselves are good in closeup  but the  crowd  scenes look more like bad disney  the cgi is overdone again and again . and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them  why do they need to inject  nanites   you know it  s a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax . it could have been great  but it  s less than the sum of its parts  mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years .  

=======================================================================================================

1124 ===> the only thing remarkable about this movie  is that all the actors could bomb at the same time . idiocy . i want my money back . . . and i got it free from the library . sheesh . i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again .  

=======================================================================================================

1125 ===>         hosted by robert deniro  presents footage from outside and inside the twin towers in new york  on september        .  br    br   never too grisly and gory  yet powerful and moving .       is a real treat . anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything .  br    br      stars    br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1126 ===> my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her . she  s from china and only heard so much about     and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary . i felt awful watching this documentary  it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes .  br    br   but i  m extremely grateful that i watched this documentary  because on the day of september   th  i  m sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard  all of us could only think certain questions  why     how     what  s going on     oh  my god   . almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others . but i don  t think we thought about what they were really going though . this wasn  t actually supposed to be a documentary about      the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything  outside and in  on tape .  br    br   on sep .   th  i thought to myself  it  s ok  the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived  . to be honest  i thought it was an accident  i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class . someone came into the locker room shouting  some building just got bombed in new york    we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv . not only   seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident . a few minutes later  we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down . so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking  what are the firemen and policemen going to do   . but it  s procedure to them i thought  they  ll know what to do .  br    br   the first tower collapsed  we knew it  so many lives are now gone  the second tower crashed  things would never be the same . those firemen in this documentary showed courage  confusion  and strength  the real raw human emotions . they didn  t know what to do  they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers . they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows . and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv . i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help . i know they feel like they were just doing their job  but they did more  they were hero  s . every day after sep .   th for  weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors  but they kept on hoping and praying . may god bless their kind and brave hearts .  br    br   as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks . she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day . she asked  why   . i didn  t know what to say  it breaks my heart that people can be that evil .  it sounds clique   but it was a normal day for everyone  one of the firemen said in the documentary . no one expected this to happen . not like that  those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked  they were just doing their job  happen to be there  or even just was there for a second passing by . they were not just murdered  they were slaughtered  and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart . then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating  why do people do this  they celebrated death and the lose of mothers  fathers  sisters  brothers  friends  grandparents  aunts  uncles  cousins  etc . why   br    br   so  thanks to those people for making this documentary . you truly think about the firemen  policemen  and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world . thank you to all those people  you are our heroes .  br    br         

=======================================================================================================

1127 ===> this movie was a mess . it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen . it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial  and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream .  br    br   under the messy direction and editing  there was a glimmer of something good . a good idea  a compelling spark . but somewhere it went wrong .  br    br   the story is about a quasi  psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders . the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest . well the part doesn  t call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well . the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy . he always plays the crazy bad guy . very ho hum .  br    br   oh  a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy  horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character  grieco  was experiencing . and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords . not a good sign for any movie .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1128 ===> this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store . don  t make the same mistake i did . this movie is tedious  unconvincingly acted  and generally boring . the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared . dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him . and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico  it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo  irish accents . odd . anyway  when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store  keep walking .  

=======================================================================================================

1129 ===> i must admit that i was very sceptical about this documentary . i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much . i was wrong . this is not propaganda  in fact it is hardly political at all .  br    br   it depicts the events of     through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed . it is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all  this film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie ny firefighter becoming  a man  . we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them .  br    br   a great piece of work . absolutely stunning material . highly recommended .  br    br   regards   

=======================================================================================================

1130 ===> it  s a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr . the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome  the guy is cute too so it  s a good match if you want to the guy or the girls .  

=======================================================================================================

1131 ===> i  ll give writer  director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill  conceived  thriller .  a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo  let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs . a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes  although the art direction is not half bad . the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst . no tension  no suspense  no dread  no fear  no empathy  no catharsis  no nothing . a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom  but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer . i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing . good for late  night  zoned  out viewing only . you have been warned .  

=======================================================================================================

1132 ===> a splendid example of how hollywood could  and still can  take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up .  br    br   in the case of  the big sky   writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize  winning author  a . b . guthrie . in so doing  they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation .  br    br   the epic nature of guthrie  s book and the evolution of its main character  boone caudill  from a naive  kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor  mountain man  has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author  s intent . in the movie version  boone  s presence is nothing except underwhelming .  br    br   intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie  s novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever . most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character  who was an incidental  minor character in the book  only occupying a handful of pages . on the other hand  a very important and fascinating character  dick summers  the veteran pioneer  is missing altogether    it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie  played by actor hunnicutt  wasn  t irritating enough . so zeb  hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious  voice  over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing  editing  and direction .  br    br   some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based  william wyler  s  ben  hur  is an excellent example  . but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself .  br    br   the story is dull and clichd  and the characters  at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script  are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie  s literary vision . and unfortunately  kirk douglas  star appeal  which could have helped lift this film  was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given .  br    br   if you can believe it  the film version of guthrie  s pulitzer prize  winning sequel   the way west   also starring kirk  is even worse .  br    br   in my opinion   the big sky  further solidifies howard hawks  place as one of the most overrated  tepid directors in the history of cinema .  

=======================================================================================================

1133 ===> a thin story with many fine shots . eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d . r . e . a . m . team . and  to a lesser extent  the guy accompanying them . traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business  couple intending to poison the world with antrax . original in this movie is the bra  bomb  put on a captured member of the d . r . e . a . m .  team . of course she is rescued by a co  member  three seconds before explosion . although clearly lent from james bond  s  goldfinger  and  you only live twice   such a climax always works well . all in all a nice watch  james bond replaced here by three charlie  s angels .  

=======================================================================================================

1134 ===> of course i would have to give this film   out of   as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime . rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over   years living in italy . he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing . so rodolfo sonego did . if you check out his biography  you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy . alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories . my uncle visited australia and my town  in     to check out locations for  a girl in australia  and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war . you can see his humor in all his movies . i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently . great  

=======================================================================================================

1135 ===> not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc  but easily the worst  never seeing the light of day . the director is not even canadian  but british  and boy does it show . we are all made out to be a bunch of over  sexed dope fiends and morons . the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent  and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk . of course the british character is normal . the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype  can you say  norm     the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes . the actors always seem to be fidgetting . are they as bored as the viewer  or is this the directors idea of cinema  avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films . a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically . you won  t be compelled to walk out on his films after   minutes .  

=======================================================================================================

1136 ===> this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine  moronic idiots . the men get stoned  drunk  and then they yell  beat each other up in almost every scene . the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus  or worse  milling around like mesmerized cattle . apparently  canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks . it  s the standard knocked  up girlfriend  her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before .  br    br   every character here is a carping  infantile stereotype . not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower  and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag  i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this . maybe he needed the money . ian tracey is a superb actor  the only one with a vague redeeming moment  but his talent is wasted here .  br    br   as for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn  or karl  who is dead  but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind  almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock  s masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films   why even bother  karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying .  br    br   by the end of this wretched movie  i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat   

=======================================================================================================

1137 ===> i love monte carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie . i thought everyone was very good . i was not familiar with richard lewis  i thought he made his character  julian peters  very personable  funny and attractive . sean young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold . george hamilton was charming and the perfect italian gigolo . john candy has a field day as the bon vivant . james belushi is hysterical as a total jerk . cybill shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife . delightful ensemble cast . lots of talent  clever script  lots going on and beautiful locations . just a nice pick me up for a dreary day . especially in the winter when a trip to europe is not anywhere on your horizon .  

=======================================================================================================

1138 ===> super  slick entertainment with a stellar cast  an outstanding script  and a firm grip on the approaching      s . at the time  rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens . but whatever the value of those shadowy downers  they reflected a war  time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era . few films of the late     s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy .  br    br   jim blandings  cary grant  works as an ad  man on madison ave . where in his little daughter  s words   he sells things to people that they don  t need  at prices they can  t afford . he  s making good money  but like thousands of others  he  s tired of living in a cramped urban  cave  . so  with wife myrnah loy  they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside . needless to say  in the arms of nature  they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion .  br    br   there  s hardly a lifeless line in the entire script . i don  t know if writers panama and frank got an oscar  but they should have . of course  the humor revolves around all the problems that pop  up when city people build a big house on rural land . the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage  with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time . of course  no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant  so it  s just one well  placed laugh after another  particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own . yet  oddly  the film appears to have no comedic high  point . instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don  t peak at any particular point . that  s a real movie triumph for any era .  br    br   reaching back   years later  we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind . with their live  in maid  the blandings may not be a typical american family  but that post  war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical . and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an  ad  man  tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more  ham  . more than anything  however  there  s the movie  s sunny optimism . oh sure  the feeling falters at times  yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through . indeed  life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge  so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day . it  s that easily over  looked subtext  along with the sheer entertainment value  that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post  war period .  br    br   so  if you haven  t seen it  catch it next time around .  

=======================================================================================================

1139 ===> this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn  t deliver his lines . the plot was definitely not worthy of john grisham  s name . no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters . i didn  t even watch the whole thing . i decided i didn  t care who done it  then realized there was no  whodunit  to care about   

=======================================================================================================

1140 ===> might contain possible spoilers  not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter   br    br   why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion  sure it  s cheaper for them  but after a while  wouldn  t you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off . house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all . some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are the voices don  t even remotely match up and iago is evil again  since when    i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films . even the movie  s musical number  which had been disney  s specialty for years  stunk . i wouldn  t recommend this film to anyone even the very young . all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released  it  s only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality .  

=======================================================================================================

1141 ===> this movie has an all star cast  john candy  richard lewis  ornella mutti  cybill shepard  and jim belushi to name a few  run amuck in monte carlo  as well as some other beautiful european locations  and is very funny . the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great  and i highly recommend that you see this movie  it is well worth it  john candy is in top form in once upon a crime  as is everyone else  if you and your family are looking for a great family film  this is your ticket . everyone gives stellar performances  great acting  great comedy  and great timing  which is rare in movies these days . great plot  great mystery   which i love anyways  and overall  well worth the money you spend on it . so get the kids  grab some popcorn  juice  or tea  or sodas  and enjoy the show      

=======================================================================================================

1142 ===> john candy  s performance in once upon a crime is possibly his best ever . it  s been my favourite movie since it came out . i spent  years searching for it . that  s how good it is . if you disagree  well  that  s your opinion . enjoy the movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1143 ===> the saddest part of this is the fact that these are   minutes i  ll never get back . i knew this was terrible from the get  go  with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof .  see if they could get away with that in      . my    year  old boy is really into baseball right now  so we decided to rent it on a rainy day . even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it  i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language . bad  bad movie . this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears . completely shameless and completely predictable . i don  t mind a predictable movie if it  s done well  but this one absolutely was not .  

=======================================================================================================

1144 ===> i just watched this horrid thing on tv . needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get . frankly  i don  t know how much lower the bar can go .  br    br   the characters are composed of one lame stereo  type after another  and the obvious attempt at creating another  bad news bears  is embarrassing to say the very least .  br    br   i have seen some prized turkeys in my time  but there is no reason to list any of them since this is  numero uno  .  br    br   let me put it to you this way  i watched the vanilla ice movie  because it was so bad it was funny . this . . . this . . . is not even that good .  

=======================================================================================================

1145 ===>  . . . about the importance of being young  having friends  and most of all enjoying life . through the experience of four friends  ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the    s in a small italian village . the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior also the drug experience is well represented .  

=======================================================================================================

1146 ===> nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the    s and    s . radiofreccia describes a generation  it describes life in a small village near correggio  hometown of ligabue  the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie   it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world . it reminds of trainspotting  with a bit of italian touch .  

=======================================================================================================

1147 ===> this movie is horrible  it rivals  ishtar  in the number of embarrassingly bad moments . i would have rated it lower than a   save for a couple of funny lines but  overall  this film was crap  it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere . joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever

1148 ===> when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn  t fail . i love billy crystal  my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it .  br    br   we were misled  in spades .  br    br   on my part  i felt billy crystal  s character was extremely one  dimensional and did very little for the film . sure  he cracked a couple of good jokes  but as a character he did nothing but take up space .  br    br   and poor julia roberts . in past shows she plays well as a strong  willed  self  determined lady . in this flick  she seems completely repressed and had very little fire . this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching .  br    br   ok  if i were to find one good thing  it would have to be christopher walken . now that  s entertainment . but  just like billy crystal  hardly anything is shown of his character .  br    br   if you  re looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value  go see it . but if you  re looking for a smart  romantic comedy  this is not your film . it  s none of the above .  

=======================================================================================================

1149 ===> radiofreccia is a movie about all of us  about our dreams  our friends  our obsessions  our addictions  our fears . it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century . the movie doesn  t take a happy or sad approach on things  it just tells us a story  one that all of us could have experienced . one of happiness and excitement  sadness and grief . the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters  it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again  feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place . hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends  listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international  playing their dreams  our dreams . radiofreccia will make you laugh  it will make you cry at times  it will shock you and comfort you  it will give you and take from you . personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life  and that of my friends  and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours .  

=======================================================================================================

1150 ===> now this show looks like most of the other shows of it  s type from the mid     s  but the only thing is about this one is that it  s different  they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too . i personally thought it was a good show  i can  t understand why would they cancel it . the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since     up to date .  br    br   my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie  which i know is gonna be impossible to do  but hey it doesn  t hurt to dream  doesn  t it   br    br   anyway  i would recommend if you hadn  t seen it to find the dvd of all   episodes  because the characters are great  the story lines are good  the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great .  

=======================================================================================================

1151 ===> characters you don  t care about  relationships you don  t care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start . julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other . she was actually somewhat endearing in this role .  

=======================================================================================================

1152 ===> i found this film to be an utter dissapointment . the talent available to the director  notably stanley tucci  chris walken  hank azaria and alan arkin  without even mentioning the four main leads   have been completely wasted on an unfunny  mediocre story  whose conclusion one couldn  t really care about once introduced to the dire  stereo  typed characters . julia roberts is feeble  zeta  jones is just plain annoying  appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity  minus the humour   crystal just plays his same old hyper  active  neurotic  annoying alter  ego and cusack simply walks through his part  apparently bored with the whole project .  br    br   for what is supposed to be a  romantic comedy   there is absolutely no romance between the central characters  let alone chemistry  and as for the comedy   possible spoilers  well  the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack  s role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin  the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever .  spoilers  azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse  maverick  dogme type director  but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead  spoilers  we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog . pure genius .  br    br   for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack  s work  not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast  i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas  and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them  instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost  gross  out  teen  movie  humour at times .  br    br   a very poor     .  

=======================================================================================================

1153 ===> this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes  the money pit and are we done yet   only points out all the more how the    s movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since  regretfully  been lost .  br    br   i was   when i first saw this and even at that tender age  there was much i could laugh at . now of course being familiar with adult frustrations  i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth .  br    br   the three main actors . . . cary grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas . . . interacted perfectly  but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream . it  s never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions .  br    br   all in all  this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it .  

=======================================================================================================

1154 ===> far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did  after animaniacs . even if the ratings were low  so what  i still enjoyed it and loved it  was so funny and i adored the cast  wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic  the whole cast were brilliant  especially the legendary frank welker .  br    br   i  d love to see this cartoon again  was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant . also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it  you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental  that was just fantastic  i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in . i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back  i loved them  

=======================================================================================================

1155 ===> billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter  but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face . . . . or perhaps just one . they call it comedy  i say it  s a waste of my time .  

=======================================================================================================

1156 ===> in fact  it never was . i  m not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a     s screwball comedy . what a vacuous shambles  none of these people come close to a cary grant  spencer tracy  katherine hepburn  etc  and anyway  today  s audience isn  t as receptive to this facile muck . writing is trivial . the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious . the chemistry between the leading characters is non  existent . it  s interesting that julia roberts seems to think she  s a reincarnation of some big star from the  golden age of hollywood   whenever that may be . it  s an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride .  

=======================================================================================================

1157 ===> michael stearns plays mike  a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality . he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that  s when he loses it . he believes that when women actually have sex that  s when they lose any sense of  innocence  and  or  beauty  . so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance  ultimately shooting the men dead with a high  powered rifle with a scope .  br    br   the seeming primary reason for this movie  s existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again . the  story  comes off as more of an afterthought . this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we  re treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity  the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes  and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation . of course  seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism .  for one thing  mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger .  this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack .  br    br   those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another . it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react . it unfolds at a very slow pace  but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist . it  s a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

1158 ===> i enjoyed this movie . haven  t seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly . i  ve associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he  s versatile .  br    br   i wasn  t troubled that dotty  s  anxiety disorder  may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook . there are zillions of whatever  phobias and neuroses  and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms . she is clearly a sensitive with extra  sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos . it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric .  br    br   although this is taken to be a light  family movie   it is actually more sophisticated than it seems . also  hiram  s twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle . it  s fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance .  

=======================================================================================================

1159 ===> i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it . but this movie was terrible . i have yet to see why people thought it was funny . the idea behind it is stupid . plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb . why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me   

=======================================================================================================

1160 ===> it was disgusting and painful . what a waste of a cast  i swear  the audience     full  laughed twice in   minutes . this is not a lie . do not even rent it .  br    br   zeta jones was just too mean to be believable .  br    br   cusack was ok . just ok . i felt sorry for him  the actor  in case people remember this mess .  br    br   roberts was the same as she always is . charming and sweet  but with no purpose . the  romance  with john was completely unbelievable .  

=======================================================================================================

1161 ===> i saw that when i was little and it was excellent . kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute . susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius . karen boettcher  tate as profster was interesting . burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny . gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant . whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy . whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon . this story is about when lisa  snoodle  doodle go to the big rock candy mountains . this show is excellent the kids will like this show  new words  songs  and watching them playing .  

=======================================================================================================

1162 ===> me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so  but they let us anyways  and i love it . . . i can  t find anyone that lives near me that knows what i am talking about . . . i  m glad to see that i  m not the only one that loved this movie . . . i wish i could find this on dvd somewhere   i would love to watch this now just bc i loved it so much as a little kid . . . and i  m   now    i remember so much about it . . . thats where i got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie   i think the little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her little playground thing  

=======================================================================================================

1163 ===> how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me . this is a terrible clich  ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done . it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film . what  s even worse is the fact that is made almost    million here in the states . it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks  even if the film is terrible . i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore  fest . billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions . whatever you do  don  t fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this .  

=======================================================================================================

1164 ===> let me put it another way balls . or  how about bolloks . this is truly awful  more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise . julia roberts is a skilled actress  and usually her work is of the highest standard . this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient . normally she is the consummate professional  yet i swear that in her eyes  there were signs of bewilderment and despair .  br    br   the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director  chris walken  turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors . unfortunately  that theme wasn  t explored to it  s full potential . too little  too late .  br    br   zeta jones was wooden  cusack was cusack  and crystal should stick to acting . the two talented ex  buffy stars had different experiences  green hopelessly mis  cast  and balfour under  used . well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made .  

=======================================================================================================

1165 ===> big rock candy mountain is amazing . i watched it when i was little  and still do to this day .  senior in high school  . if i could imagine heaven  that is what it would look like . i wish i could live in big rock candy mountain where candy grows on trees . zach hyman is profs  and my best friend . little bunny foo foo is the man . it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night . in fact  my friend who is   recently watched it for the first time and absolutely loved it . i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie . i am having a huge party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie . we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle . i constantly find myself watching clouds and wishing i was that little girl that got to visit . thanks . bye .  

=======================================================================================================

1166 ===> when i was little  my parents got this movie for me to watch . i really liked it  and i watched it over and over again . even when i was in  rd grade i still watched it from time to time . recently  i watched it again  just for the sake of nostalgia  and though the show was not aimed for my age group  i  m in my late teens   i still found it entertaining and educational . this show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others . some parts i found quite entertaining . also  this show does not have any bad content  so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot . i would recommend this .  

=======================================================================================================

1167 ===> if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt    oklar  as it is promised by the tag line  you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt    oklar regarding most famous issues like sex  marriage and cheating . to much nudity  which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt    oklar was unsuccessfully to  try something new  as he has quoted . to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt    oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is  sex sells .  i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique . however in the end i found myself sitting down for   minutes and watching alt    oklar  s experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work .  

=======================================================================================================

1168 ===> divorced lawyer rick magruder  branagh  stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named mallory doss  davidtz   who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car . rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there  seemingly by her father  dixon doss  duvall  . rick and mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when mallory carelessly undresses in front of rick  and he then spends the night with her .  br    br   rick wakes up in the morning and mallory encounters him later in the day  asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior . rick  now obsessed with mallory and willing to do anything for her  is successful in having dixon put on trial and sent to prison  but when he is freed by his local friends  rick finds himself in a trouble  trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life .  

=======================================================================================================

1169 ===> this incredibly formulaic flick from the  walker  texas ranger  squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie . in addition  one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get  go . however  it  s a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains . that  s all it was meant to do and it does so . the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn  t half bad . the acting is also decent  which isn  t much of a surprise  because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal . if you  re a fan of the genre  and of  walker  texas ranger    you will definitely love this . if not  then don  t waste your time .      

=======================================================================================================

1170 ===> a true hero of modern times  chuck norris has left tv  walker  rexas ranger   and is looking new steps for his artistic career . the presidents man is the second movie of a future tv series  with norris in the title role  and with young actors like jennifer tung or judson mills  one of the young rangers of  walker   . the old master teachs to young aspirant . its one of the most powerful themes of  the presidents man  . in this tima   a line in the sand  has reached world surprise for his tratment of terrorism in usa  months before the tragic september   . eric norris  son of chuck is the director . the movie is amusing  a good action work  plenty of fights and heroism . chuck norris have many plans for the future . bells of innocence  his next picture  will be the following .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1171 ===> terrible movie . if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in      that should be banyo . what a waste of time . other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing  nada  zilch  nil . the dialog is cheap  and sexual clichs are all over it . the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own . the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do . if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting . the only good thing i can say about the movie is  wait  wait  there is nothing good i can say about it . i must have really disliked it to write about it this much . jeez   

=======================================================================================================

1172 ===> this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible . as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film  how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago  but then again i saw this video . in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script  one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe  yet this movie lacks them all . you heard me it lacks them all . there is not a single point i like about this movie  none . i hate it . i  m sure anyone will do so too . the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff  yet it fails even at the nudity . i don  t know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so  and i definitely recommend you don  t do so . worst movie i  ve seen in my entire life . if someone offers you to watch it  ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife  

=======================================================================================================

1173 ===> there are a few spoilers in this comment    br    br   contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex  u and a few others  i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series .  br    br   i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i  ll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little  the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired .  br    br   the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed . i do fail to see how that many  professionals  weren  t able to hit a moving target  but the action was definitely there and deke  being the hero  had to survive .  br    br   as for the comment about needing to  get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs .  this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of      a good  months before the terrorist attacks against the u . s .  br    br   if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it  maybe they would have realized the plot of the story rashid  a bin laden like character  planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states . the president  s man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem .  br    br   perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1174 ===> i  ve always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film . although the acting may not be superb  the fight scenes are fantastic . i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him . in my opinion  the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production  i hope you take the time to view this movie   

=======================================================================================================

1175 ===> this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time . it stars shaquille o  neil and is about a rapping genie . apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece . the movie gets  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

1176 ===> would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball . this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level . in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp . he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra . this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world  the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it .  

=======================================================================================================

1177 ===> if you  re a a fan of either or both chuck norris  judson mills then this is the movie to see . it has a lot of adventure in it . it is a great follow up to president  s man . the chemistry between the main three stars  chuck norris  judson mills  jennifer tung  is incredible . my personal opinion . this movie along with the original  has turned out so well  that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series . if you  ve seen president  s man  i recommend this movie for you . if you  ve seen president  s mana line in the sand but you haven  t seen president  s man  then let me suggest that you do . you will not be disappointed with either one .  

=======================================================================================================

1178 ===> composed  elegant carol  marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke   her nice husband eddie  likable david houseman   carol  s wacky  constantly eating best gal pal anna  delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable chris jordan   and anna  s hunky  amorous husband pete  a typically fine eric edwards  are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other . their usual routine gets disrupted when carol  s lonely  repressed  but still alluring widow mother jennifer  a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welles  drops by for a visit . pretty soon jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers  blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle  with everyone except carol eager to seduce her . writer  director joe sarno concocts a sharp  engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild  n  easy    s sexual revolution sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother  daughter incest subplot . moreover  sarno elicits uniformly first  rate acting from the bang  up cast welles and brooke are both exceptional  with excellent support from edwards  jordan  houseman  arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara  and erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs . fields . better still  all the women are extremely hot and enticing welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence . the sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit  but never raunchy or tedious . stephen colwell  s bright  polished cinematography and jack justis  bouncy  melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective . recommended viewing for sarno fans .  

=======================================================================================================

1179 ===> there was a genie played by shaq his name was kazaam  and he was whack his rhymes were corny  this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin  bad casting  bad special effects whats next  this movie sucks prolly didn  t make   bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp . . .  br    br   yeah  you get it  a stupid rhyming genie who can  t act  in a stupid movie with horrible special effects . oh  and its confusing as hell . i  m not even gonna go on . let  s just say  it belongs in the  its so bad  its funny  category . watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh . but don  t expect anything spectacular .  

=======================================================================================================

1180 ===> yes  kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies  but with humanity . here we have shaq as a rapping genie  yes  a rapping genie  where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits  all ending in him in a christ  like pose with lots of light surrounding him . so  yeah  expect really cheesy bits  including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky  and  regrettably  not knocking out the two main characters  particularly the kid  . what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille o  neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy  the main plot of the film involves this kid  played in that all  too  typical and annoying  kid fashion by the great  grandson of frank capra  where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily   who comes upon a genie who  s been trapped in a boom  box . then  hiarity ensues  as the kid makes the shaq  genie his quasi  slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady  gang  type absentee father .  br    br   this really sappy  contrived son and father story would be bad enough  as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies  i . e . the  two chances in life  speech from father to son  . but it  s shaquille o  neill who is both the reason to watch the film  ironically   and the obvious sinking crux of it all . his plot line involves him  when not getting the over  talky treatment from capra  to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career . on top of this  he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom  box . so is there a camp factor to the movie  up to a point  but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and  heart  felt  moments that have really no business with the rest of the material . one might ask if the people making the movie  who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon  if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing . i  d hope that they too knew they were just getting paid . but i  d hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaq  machine .  br    br   so  if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genie  turned  rapper  turned  wisecracker  all the more fun to you . hell  it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel . but if you  re hoping to keep a few brain cells  stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of      and a candidate among many others for worst of the    s .  

=======================================================================================================

1181 ===> ah  the      s . a time when it was in to be a swinger . to be honest  today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then .  br    br   joe sarno offers up a pretty good soft  core film . in fact  just like today  some of the actors are famous hardcore actors . unlike today  these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development .  br    br   it  s pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger  s movie . two couples with open relationships re  ignite the wanderlust out of the milf of one of the women who has come for a visit . not much more to it .  br    br   of course  when the milf is jennifer welles then it is a different story . not too many    somethings look as delicious undressed as ms . welles . it  s worth the price alone to see ms . welles look at herself in the mirror as if she  s aphrodite . she  s no  stifler  s mom  . she  s way sexier .  br    br   i also digged chris jordan  s anna . jordan looks and sounds so much like elaine joyce that i thought she might be her  separated at birth  twin or even elaine herself . anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism .  br    br   unlike      s soft  core porn     s softie porn retained the hardcore film  s realism  something that      s soft  core has brought back on occasion  instead of the    s music and canned orgasms  and it is here in full force . it  s not real but it feels real .  br    br   for those who enjoyed the quebec produced  deux femmes en or   you  ll enjoy this one . another classic film only on drive  in classics  the best   .   can a month you can spend .

1182 ===> though not seen in too many films prior  you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since .  br    br   not one of grant  s nor loy  s best films  they make an outstanding effort together . after all  with that much talent and very good supporting cast  you know the laughs will be there .  br    br   the film is light  has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through .  br    br   a great example of classic american film fare that has stood the test of time .  br    br   definite saturday afternoon fare  heavy on the popcorn .  

=======================================================================================================

1183 ===> i feel like i  m the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh  s performance . he is a fine actor by most accounts  but he simply could not pull off the southern accent . i mean  it was deplorable . it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank . one of the previous reviewers questioned why u . s . actors were not cast in this film . i second that notion . it  s wonderful when actors  actresses wish to expand their horizons  but it  s another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained . maybe it was altman  but he  s a such a great director . . .  br    br   well  i really don  t want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much . everybody deserves to screw up here and there . but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you  d rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man .  

=======================================================================================================

1184 ===> if the crew behind  zombie chronicles  ever read this  here  s some advice guys  br    br    . in a  twist ending   type movie  it  s not a good idea to insert close  ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits . that tends to spoil the twists  y  know . . .   br    br    . i know you produced this on a shoestring and  to be fair  you worked miracles with your budget but please  hire people who can actually act . or at least  walk  talk and gesture at the same time . joe haggerty  i  m looking at you . . .  br    br    . if you  re going to set a part of your movie in the past  only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time .  br    br    . twist endings are supposed to be a surprise . sure  we don  t want twists that make no sense  but signposting the  reveal  as soon as you introduce a character  that  s not a great idea .  br    br   kudos to the guys for trying  but in all honesty  i  d rather they hadn  t . . .  br    br   only for zombie completists .  

=======================================================================================================

1185 ===> this movie is far better than the original the jerk . i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor . we have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from monty python .  br    br   the card game with the hobos and then with mr . suicide . the scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup . the original the jerk was too choreographed ans staged . while i like steve martin  he seemed like he was trying to hard . the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone . the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk .  

=======================================================================================================

1186 ===> honestly  when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off . as i sat there for the next   minutes or so  i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show . his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn  t been in more comedies . he has this  marty feldman  thing going for him but much  much more talent . . . taking nothing away from marty . the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk  but then again  it was so much more . i really think that if this movie was released first  and i saw the steve martin movie  nd  i  d think the  nd was a cheap rip  off . i know it sounds like a bold statement  but it  s true . i actually like steve martin a great deal  but his performance is  nd to the actor in the jerk too . i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection . i urge you to see it if you can find it .  

=======================================================================================================

1187 ===> now  i  m one to watch movies that got poor reviews  and say   hmm . . . this isn  t so bad   i loved the cable guy  and thought that my big fat independent movie was great . keep in mind  i really didn  t start watching this with high hopes  but i figured that maybe . . . just maybe . . . it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it . i was wrong . at no point at all during my suffering through this  film   and i use that term sparingly  was i even close to being mildly entertained . to start  shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting . i hate rap music  but as far as i could tell  an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him . the main character is simply annoying  and not a character that it  s easy to like . quite frankly  i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus  bloody sores than watch this again .  

=======================================================================================================

1188 ===> let me give a quick summery of the film a rotten  rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam a rapping genie . like all genies  he grants  wishes but  being good natured  also helps max with his personal life  as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime . during all this  kazaam raps from time to time   also showcasing shaq  s dismal rap skills  .  br    br   this movie proves what we all know athletes need to stick to sports . i admit that it never looked like an oscar  worthy movie  but everything about this waste of film is horrible . the characters are either unlikable or stupid  the plot is not even worth mentioning  the dialog is a joke  and shaq is only a quarter of the problem . hell  even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke . i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big  no pun intended  at the time . i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time . shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws .  

=======================================================================================================

1189 ===> i don  t understand . not being a critic  i am not evaluating the quality of the acting  which i find believable  a good thing . my confusion lies with the content . is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country . should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so  what effect their cheating  wives   infidelity had on them  while these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness  did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily  they didn  t think of their husbands at all  only of themselves . pardon me  except when they wished their husbands dead .  

=======================================================================================================

1190 ===> stuck in a hotel in kuwait  i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning . first pachelbel  s canon brought a lump to my throat  then the sight of a tiger moth  which my grandfather  my father and i have all flown  produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe  s name hooked me completely . i was entranced by this film  crowe  s performance  again   the subject matter  and yes  what a debt we owe   how various matters were addressed and dealt with  the flying sequences  my father flew avro ansons  too   the story  and  as another contributor pointed out  crowe  s recitation of high flight . i won  t spoil the film for anyone  but  separated from my wife by       odd miles  as an ex  army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot  i admit to crying heartily a couple of times . buy it  rent it  download it  beg  borrow or steal it  but watch it .  br    br   ps did i spy a bristol blenheim  in yellow training colours  on the ground  looked like a twin  engine aircraft with a twin  .    brownings in a dorsal turret .  

=======================================================================================================

1191 ===> reviewing kazaam and saying it  s a bad movie isn  t hard at all   after all  critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film   saying it was among the worst films of the decade  so the fact that i say it  s bad or anyone else says it  s bad is certainly no surprise . it  s like someone talking about wwii   practically no one says that was a good thing  right   the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is  why did they make this in the first place    . after all  it  s obvious to anyone who isn  t severely brain injured that the film would be horrible . but  movies like ed  a baseball playing chimp   cool as ice  starring the ever  popular vanilla ice   troll   which doesn  t even have any trolls in it   baby geniuses  einstain  like superhero babies  and pinocchio in outer space  huh     prove that any idea  no matter how dumb  can make it to the big screen  so  the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright  normal    br    br   the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school . like the punk from free willy  this kid is somehow  misunderstood   in other words  a total brat  and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is  by the end of the film he  ll have learned something and grown . just once  i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film  eventually  while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him  the genie kazaam  shaquille o  neal  is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes . but  the kid doesn  t believe him and the genie  s magic seems a tad rusty .  br    br   eventually the brat does realize that kazaam is for real . however  unlike most kids  he withholds making his wishes so  in the meantime  kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere   like his own personal servant . and  according to the clich  you know that by the end of the film  max and kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed . oh  and max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom  s fianc  i  m gonna gag  . apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes .  br    br   as for kazaam  shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap . . . very poorly . i  m a middle  aged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well  he  s an amazing basketball player and i  ve heard he  s a nice guy   but a rapper . . . no way  as far as his acting goes  he wasn  t great but had such a nice personality in the film that it  s hard to hate him   even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things .  br    br   so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you  ve probably heard  through the first two  thirds of the movie  i would have said no . shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script . however  later in the film  the bad becomes horrid   as kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he  s really needed . and  out of nowhere  the plot gets really  really weird   as the guy who wants to make kazaam a rap star       turns out to be an evil mobster  and  oddly  this guy seems to accept that kazaam is a genie with no hesitation   br    br   in addition  the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad . i know that the kid was annoying  but this is supposed to be a kids  film   what part of  trying to kill the kid  didn  t the writers not understand    then  in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history  kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug  induced hallucination  this ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in the black hole . . . and boy  did it make my brain hurt   uggghh   the horrible dialog was just too much to bear     br    br   overall  it  s a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane . yes  folks  with a messed up message  bizarre non  kid friendly material and horrible characters  this is one wretched film . sadly  given the idea and actors  it  s hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse    br    br   by the way  if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good  try the british made for tv film  bernard and the genie    a charming and exceptionally well  written film from start to finish .  

=======================================================================================================

1192 ===> the only reason i dvrd this movie was because  . i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and  . i  ve always heard how awful it was . the movie did not disappoint . the best parts were shaq  s outfits . the worst parts were  well  just about everything else . my   year old son and i just squirmed and couldn  t look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn  t wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his  but for all it  s terribleness we just couldn  t stop watching it  the story sucked you in  like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit  it was hypnotic . but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched  kazzam  .  

=======================================================================================================

1193 ===> i felt this film  throughout . i waas impressed with russell crowe  s talent in developing his relationship with lillie  such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach  a bit self depreciating and very persistent . really loved the cinematography and direction . pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive .  br    br   gosh  didn  t russell  s talent even in     shine  . . and i have yet to see gladiator .  

=======================================================================================================

1194 ===> i have just seen this film  and fallen in love with it . there is a little bit of something for everyone  and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between lachlan and lil . when they are on the beach  i nearly cried . . . there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together . this idea taken from several angles  from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places . the film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last . crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of lachlan . i  ve always had a soft spot for the accent  but i nearly melted with his portrayal of his character . the way this film was shot is also beautiful  with the music  backdrop of the open fields  and superb acting . all together  this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions .  

=======================================================================================================

1195 ===> this movie has successfully proved what we all already know  that professional basket  ball players suck at everything besides playing basket  ball . especially rapping and acting . i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is . first of all  is it just me  or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen  i mean  his teeth could be used as a can  opener . secondly  why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when  even though he has magical powers  he sucks horribly at making music  third  i have read the bible . in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies . fourth  what was the deal with all the crappy special effects  i assure you that any acne  addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that . fifth  why did the ending suck so badly  and what the hell is a djin  and finally  whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower  because this movie take the word  suck  to an entirely new level .  

=======================================================================================================

1196 ===> i was given the book version of kazaam for my  th birthday  and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie  but this time they were wrong . at least with the movie it  s over soon .  br    br   the acting in this is terrible  which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster  which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there  . the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor . he  s bullied by neighborhood kids  which i don  t blame them because he  s a little douche bag .  br    br   the story is just plain stupid and extremely clich . about a boy who  s father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father .  br    br   even at  years old i thought this was a stupid idea . it  s a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it  s an embarrassment and should have never been made . i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks  but you should already know just by reading the plot .  

=======================================================================================================

1197 ===> russell  my fav  is gorgeous in this film . but more than that  the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow . everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected . the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity . fabulous love story between lachlin and lil . i replay their scenes over and over again . anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people . all characters are cast and portrayed excellently .  

=======================================================================================================

1198 ===> movie  comedies  nowadays are generally    minutes of toilet humor  foul language  and groin  kicking . modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator  the undemanding and slow of brain . sure  an occasional good comedy will come along  but they  re becoming rarer all the time .  br    br    mr . blandings buildings his dream house  shows what     s hollywood was capable of  and it  s just screamingly funny . jim and muriel blandings  cary grant and myrna loy  decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs . the film follows their story  beginning with house hunting trips  the house  s riotous construction  all the way to the finished home   with its  zuzz  zuzz water softener  .  br    br   grant and loy are perfect for their roles  of course  grant is particularly funny as he watches the house  s costs zoom out of control  . however  the film is stolen by the blandings  wise attorney  played to perfection by melvyn douglas . managing to steal every scene he  s in  douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis . reginald denny as the blandings  harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful .  br    br   i  ve watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh . i think it  s a good film to watch when you need a lift  whether you  re building a house or not .  

=======================================================================================================

1199 ===> how a director of altman  s experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with  or to care about what happens to  a lead character who is neurotic  a whiner  a jerk with no redeeming qualities   that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work . a monstrous piece of trash . in addition to this crippling flaw  the plot line requires serious concentration to follow . the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience . this latter issue is at the core of the film it represents directorial self  indulgence with profound contempt for the taste  values  and intelligence of the viewer . very unusual for mr . altman .  br    br   patrick watson  

=======================================================================================================

1200 ===> there  s only one thing i need to say about this movie  the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis capra  s character about wanting to be a genie never see this movie . the story is horrible  the acting is terrible  c  mon  it  s shaq   and i  d rather see capra in free willy  equally horrible  twice before ever seeing this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1201 ===> this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life . we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight . a very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don  t just happen on the front .  br    br   luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great  grandparents  grandparents or parents went through during a war . this film  i think  is a small thank you . peter outerbridge looks amazingly like a young peter o  toole and russell crowe is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be . it  s definitely worth listening to him recite  high flight  and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare .  

=======================================================================================================

1202 ===> japanese tomo akiyama  s keko mask       is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch  there are also some sequels  but i haven  t seen them since these films are hyper rare . some kind of re  releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films . the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline  which is  according to the teachers  the most important thing in education . the school is lead by incredibly funny looking  just look at the costume   human wizard  whatever  who is like principal in the school  and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed . well  the main thing about the film is its name  keko mask  who is some beautiful and masked fairy  who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers  yes  this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background . the most important thing is  of course  that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked  her identity is never revealed in these films  and also the credits say  keko mask unknown  while the actor names are listed   br    br   the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies . she has a gorgeous  but lethal vagina  yes  you read right . she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them  spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view  after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs  the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like  i  ve never seen such a beautiful vagina  and  now i can die in peace .  this film is totally fantastic    br    br   there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films  japanese censors optically fog  blur all the pubic hair in any film  and also about some restrictions among school students  like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc .  there  s one great scene in which one nerd sees girl  s bare you  know  what for the first time  and says  hey there  s no fog in it   i couldn  t help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this . also  one character says in the end that he will return  if japan films allows to make the sequel . i  m glad it allowed as i  ve heard the sequels are equally outrageous . one sequel should include blues brothers  yes  those blues brothers   in it etc .  br    br   this is trash in its most enjoyable  funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find . this would definitely be even greater experience  if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point  but fortunately those segments are very few . this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don  t mention here and it wouldn  t be even necessary to tell them all here . if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek  i think you  ll love this little gem as i do  and the director is definitely a genius in this field      perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal   

=======================================================================================================

1203 ===> what a pathetic movie .  br    br   i won  t waste much time commenting about it . i  m still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it .  br    br   let me leave it simply with  shaq has no business being an actor or singer . he is utterly without talent at both discplines . it  s a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds .  br    br   much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no  talent that is shaq .  

=======================================================================================================

1204 ===> the first half of this version was the best i  ve seen  and i think i  ve seen every version of jane eyre ever made  . the development of jane  s childhood and character were exceptional . then  it was as though someone said  uh oh  this is running too long   and hacked the rest of the story to shreds . the major scenes  when included at all  are glossed over  combined  and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline . there was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow . the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope  and then the end dashed it .  

=======================================================================================================

1205 ===> given the opposite circumstance of     where the reality is we do have a black president  this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance . for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant . i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time  but also found the music and dancing incredible . also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor . he plays rufus jones  a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy . he is told  why some day you could be president  . this was so ridiculous in     that it was mocked and thought to be endearing  charming and funny . the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man . they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church .  br    br   the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in . it is really well done and very entertaining . i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us . in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president  but that it is normal  just makes this movie that much more relevant . it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness .  

=======================================================================================================

1206 ===> now  many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title . if you do not have the stomach for gory movies  then what are you doing reading this review  anyhow  i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately . this movie is chock full of wonderful gore  plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b  movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience  if you  re a lover of good quality experiences  then by all means  watch this great flick   

=======================================================================================================

1207 ===> i love the book   jane eyre  and have seen many versions of it . all have their strong points and their faults . however  this was one of the worst i have seen . i didn  t care about jane or mr . rochester . charlotte gainsbourg  jane  was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part  but she had no emotion in any of her lines . i couldn  t imagine what mr . rochester saw in her .  br    br   that brings us to mr . rochester . william hurt had even less emotion than jane  if that were possible . how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery  but it certainly didn  t hold my attention . perhaps the director  zeffrelli  fell asleep during the production .  br    br   the timothy dalton  too handsome for mr . rochester   version is far more faithful to the book  but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr . rochester in the     a  e version  which is not all that true to the book  .  br    br   trying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role .  

=======================================================================================================

1208 ===> oh just what i needed  another movie about   th century england . which is pretty much like regular england  only nobody  s vandalising football stadiums . in this picturesque setting of lords  dames and other randomly chosen titles  charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre  from that novel nobody has ever read willingly . jane usually hangs out in mr . rochester  s crib  where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time . one day  mr . rochester  william hurt on auto  pilot  comes back to fall in love with jane and all that  but there  s still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic . oops  that wasn  t in the brochure . after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire  they probably rented the set   the movie finally comes to an end . everything looked really authentic  that  s something i guess . but then again  nah .  

=======================================================================================================

1209 ===> well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen . the effects are so bad you just have to laugh  and the acting  well lets say its no mel gibson . but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad  he becomes good . i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a   . you must see it if your in to horror  slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time . killer movie .

1210 ===> why does this have such a low rating  i really don  t get it . . . is it because of the bad acting  the bad dialogue  well  who cares about these things in cheesy low  budget horror movies  seriously  the acting and the dialogue isn  t important in those movies . people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn  t be allowed to rate cheesy low  budget movies . those movies shouldn  t be taken seriously . period .  br    br   anyway  time to talk about the movie  right  well  i loved it  i bought it because i expected a gorefest  but it  s not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad  most of the time it  s just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that  s lame   but i didn  t really care because the movie is hilarious  the characters are hilarious  the acting is hilarious  bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low  budget horror movies   the dialogue is hilarious  bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low  budget horror movies   the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious  the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on  but i don  t want to say too much . . . but i have to mention that there  s a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it  s alive lol  oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol   br    br   best lines in the movie  br    br   detective manners sniffs coke detective sloane what the beep are you doing  manners  what the hell did you snort  what the hell is that  detective manners it  s nothing man  it  s . . . ehh . . . cold medicine . . .  br    br   detective manners injects heroin in his arm detective sloane what the beep are you doing  manners  are you beep insane  detective manners it  s cold medicine .  br    br   detective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the hell  s going on  manners  what are you doing  detective manners this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock  he just started smashing his head on the rock  i think he  s on pcp or something   br    br   lol   

=======================================================================================================

1211 ===> having read the novel before seeing this film  i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot . i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of bronte  s work  and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story . in the condensing of the film to a short  hours  the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional  thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding . there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre  so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their  love  is superficial . this is such an injustice to bronte  s novelyou are given no impression of jane  s quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her  and his arrogance which attracts jane to him .  br    br   despite to poor scripting  i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely  namely mrs fairfax and grace poole  however overall the production was poor . given a better scripting  perhaps the film would have been more successful . see  jane eyre        with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production .  

=======================================================================================================

1212 ===> i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story  good actors but mismatched  and i would also say rushed . it has been about   years since i read the book as it was in school . but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out  therefore it doesn  t fully make sense . for example jane  mr rochester have hardly spoken  suddenly he is proposing marriage    the actors don  t have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story . the actors are good but aren  t given enough time to do this story justice . i  m sorry to say it but i didn  t really enjoy this version . the     version with susanna york  george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the     bbc mini series version with zelah clarke  timothy dalton in the  main roles . i love it so much i watch it regularly . there is an abridged version which goes for    mins or the full version for    mins .  

=======================================================================================================

1213 ===> one of the great classic comedies . not a slapstick comedy  not a heavy drama . a fun  satirical film  a buyers beware guide to a new home .  br    br   filled with great characters all of whom  cary grant is convinced  are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home .  br    br   a great look at life in the late    s .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1214 ===> i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating  because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds . as a matter of fact  they didn  t  at least  so its seems . some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie  that  s it  this is what the majority of viewers think . however  the surprise comes at the end  and unfortunately then  when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie . i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilian  portuguese title of this movie means  voyage into death  . this is the spoiler .  br    br   that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat  on reasons that are completely unclear   you understand only in the last  minutes . when you start the movie with the english title  haunted boat  in your head  you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the  ghosts  . but in reality  this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer  watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality  it is told from the perspective of the young girl . we see her not alone  but together with the four friends because she sees them . we do not see that she is alone . so  the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture  stream  but the main story  we have at least two parallel worlds the world in which the girl is and the world in which the  friends are . an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat .  br    br   i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie  the movie  makers  cheated  an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film  student elaborate with hastily  chosen  pseudo  actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers . how mistaken can one be  but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes  the end that follows gives another surprise . the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat . when she has recovered from her shock  she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends . and there they are again  they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore . she jumps into the water  arrives at the boat  and they are away . miraculously beautiful . it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer when i awoke  i saw death standing at my bed . but i closed my eyes . when i opened them again  he was gone .  

=======================================================================================================

1215 ===> what was franco zeffirelli thinking  was hollywood responsible for this travesty  or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn  t speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte  s classic  i don  t think i can improve on a comment i read below  so i  ll just paraphrase it  jane eyre is a great great book  the screenwriter should read it sometime .  it  s true that this movie  s two leads were sadly miscast . but pity the actors  because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes . the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun . . . deleted from the script . the marriage proposal  the fortune teller . . . gone . the allusions  half joking  half sincerely felt  to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair . . . eliminated .  br    br   it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane  s interactions with the rivers family . but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written .  br    br   do yourself a favor and go find the        mini series with timothy dalton .  

=======================================================================================================

1216 ===> i read the novel  jane eyre  for the first time back in     . it was round that time that i saw the bbc  version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke . it was an excellent version and very much like the book . years later  i laid eyes on this version and was horrified . william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester . mr rochester is a passionate character  where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice . the same goes for charlotte gainsborough . it was like watching two zombies together . this is story about love and passion  but i couldn  t see it in this version . no  back to the bbc  version . a wonderful time is guaranteed .  

=======================================================================================================

1217 ===> i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england . i  ve seen hundreds of films since  but i  ve never forgotten this one . although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character  he was excellent in the role . a lot of people seem to think that he did  nt really come into his own until his role in  from here to eternity  but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho . the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad . i  d never see or heard of him before this film . conrad plays a terrific part in this film . i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character . also i remember the music  that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears . an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again . it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth . i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color  i remember sinatra  s blue shirt .  

=======================================================================================================

1218 ===> i  ve always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd . frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one .  br    br   when we first meet frank in the film  s title role  he  s the brother of a notorious gunfighter who  s out of town at the moment . the brother strikes terror in the heart  s of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow . only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him . she  s the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adams .  br    br   two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra  s brother and he  s coming to his town to take over . they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town . kirk follows him .  br    br   overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone . it  s a well acted performance  almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm . pity for some reason this has not been seen for years .  br    br   two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark . and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen . he  s a villain of incredible malevolence  pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen .  br    br   however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with . let  s just say i believe johnny concho was mgm  s answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order .  

=======================================================================================================

1219 ===> i don  t like using the word  awful  to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time  effort  talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferelli  s attempt to adapt charlotte bront  s novel  jane eyre  is a total waste of time .  br    br   the script is lacking in finesse and power  everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms  leaving little to the imagination . the lead actors are woefully miscast  clearly hired for their star names  and the musical score drippy and dull . charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all . she is like a wet noodle  worse even than joan fontaine  who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion . and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy . of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick .  br    br   joan plowright  s mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out .  br    br   there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochester  s first wife . the role of the would  be second wife  played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson  is an empty cipher .  br    br   fiona shaw  a very great actress  is completely wasted as jane  s aunt  mrs reed . she would have been better  cast as mrs fairfax . only amanda root  as jane  s beloved school teacher  evokes any authentic sympathy or believability .  br    br   i saw this version of  jane eyre  after viewing robert young  s for british television  made in      starring ciaran hinds  samantha morgan and gemma jones . there is no comparison . young  s vital  romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferelli  s wet squib .  br    br   i will be interested now to see the     version with timothy dalton  about which i  ve read some very good things on this web  site . i am amazed at how many people liked zefferelli  s yorkshire picture book .  br    br   about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored  beyond that it is a complete dud .  

=======================================================================================================

1220 ===> this version is pretty insipid  i  m afraid . jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood  but william hurt  s weary  throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored  petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt  i also can  t believe that they eliminated edward  s great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book  one of the most moving moments in literature . i do appreciate that they finally used such a young  plain woman to play jane  a character who is supposed to be a worldly    but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel  please see the    s version with george c . scott and susannah york . york was too old  tall and pretty to play jane  but no one has touched rochester  s character the way that scott did .  

=======================================================================================================

1221 ===> dick clement and ian la frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their tv work is concerned . however  their film work has been much more chequered       s the bank job was fine  the previous year  s across the universe decidedly weak  for instance  .  br    br   still crazy  fortunately  is a solid success . it has a great story  excellent performances  a lot of humour  fabulous music and  above everything else  real heart .  br    br   i savour  moments   and this film has one of them  just when everything is going pear  shaped at the festival reunion performance . . .  br    br   hugely enjoyable .  

=======================================================================================================

1222 ===> i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm  happy feeling . i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time  i thoroughly enjoyed this film . the acting was superb  although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance . bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films . timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance . and billy connolly  as always  totally gorgeous . it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned . such a refreshing experience to see a well  written  superbly acted and good  looking movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1223 ===> i can  t say this is the worst film of all time  but only because there are still some movies i haven  t seen  yet  this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time  the director suffers from the same issues he had with  there will be blood   though he wasn  t quite as bad in that film . the whole movie it feels like you  re watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities . it  s like he sits in his little director  s chair and thinks  how would a great filmmaker handle this scene   he just doesn  t have it in him . i don  t know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker . there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished  but nothing was brought to ripen . the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history . one by one as we see the characters singing  and i squirmed in my seat  i kept saying  please  please  just don  t have the guy on the brink of death singing  too   sure enough  massive failure   

=======================================================================================================

1224 ===> this ambitious film suffers most from writer  director paul thomas anderson  s delusions of grandeur . highly derivative of much better material  altman  s  nashville   lumet  s  network    this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere . a couple of misguided detours along the way  an embarrassing musical interlude  a biblical plague  don  t help matters . neither does the uneven level of performances . especially bad william h . macy  whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore  for her unconvincing angst . and how many times must we see john c . reilly  s sad sack shtick   chicago  and  the hours  will suffice   tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist  foul  mouthed holy roller was rather amusing . speaking of foul mouths  the script was so loaded with  f  bombs  they lost their impact in no time . don  t even talk about that awful soundtrack  full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann . her extended rendition of  one   a maudlin number to begin with  drove me to distraction at the start of the film . i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours  by which time i  d been pushed to the brink of hell . one redeeming feature  which i haven  t seen mentioned in other reviews  is the best performance in the bunch  by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia  the damaged coke fiend bent on self  destruction . her credibility exceeded all others by far . this film took itself way too seriously and just didn  t know when to end .  

=======================================================================================================

1225 ===> wonderful movie with good story great humour  some great one  liners  and a soundtrack to die for .  br    br   i  ve seen it  times so far .  br    br   the american audiences are going to love it .  

=======================================================================================================

1226 ===> i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it . the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious . another highlight of the movie is definitely the music  which hopefully will be released soon . i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians . go and see . it  s great .  

=======================================================================================================

1227 ===> magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming  shrieking  overwrought  hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret  guilt and pain . pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess .  br    br   a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent  and they were . i just wish that every scene didn  t involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused .  br    br   i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film . the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at . but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display . i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself  but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution . throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament .  br    br   i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and i  ll be looking for the soundtrack cd . in short  a good movie to look at and listen to  the music  that is  if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been  

=======================================================================================================

1228 ===> i think i  ve seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they  re all very poor  except for the rainmaker  but this one is so bad it  s unbelievable  br    br   warning spoilerish  br    br   it  s one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do . he  s a lawyer for christ  s sake . why when his children go missing does he not call the police . oh yes it  s because all the police hate lawyers so they  re just ignore him and let him be attacked .  br    br   when he  s arrested for murder they just let him go free  he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing .  br    br   why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home .  br    br   the police don  t bother to try and find an escaped mental patient  they don  t bother to interview his daughter .  br    br   as for the ridiculous ending .  br    br   in summary  silly  very unrealistic and a complete waste of time .  br    br        one of the worst films ever made .  

=======================================================================================================

1229 ===> i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years . a successful band from the    s decide to give it another try . they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues  with hilarious results . the music is fantastic  the script and acting are terrific . the characters are spot on  especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice  makeup and personality problems . the concert at the end was unreal . go and see it  preferably in a cinema with a good sound system    

=======================================================================================================

1230 ===> an excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it  s clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie .  br    br   it  s not quite the comedy i expected  much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor . for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny .  br    br   i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies  but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i can  t help it imagine if the commitments actually did make it big   and then tried to recapture said glory   years later .  

=======================================================================================================

1231 ===> my guess is that this director  writer had something to say . let  s see  what it could have been . . . a . frog storms would be creepy  b . can i get someone like tom cruise to say the  c  word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter  c . cast my wife and get her to say the  f  word every  seconds . this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm . the rest was a relentless  over  long  under  edited   over  indulgent failure . glad so many of you enjoyed it   br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1232 ===> normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films  but this one really annoyed me . all they did was swear . for the whole film .  and  as someone else noted  get cancer  it was boring  rambling and pretentious . i wouldnt if i were you .  br    br   its also not that i dont like films which  as most people who like it will claim  observe life  . i love eat drink man woman  and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives . but i could relate to them . i have never met anyone who swore as much as the  actors  in this film  and i used to work on a construction site . so go figure . having said that william h . macy made me grin . once .  br    br       . avoid  unless you enjoy tedium .  

=======================================================================================================

1233 ===> this movie maked me cry at the end  i watch at least    movies a week . i seen loads of great movies  even more crap  ones . but when ending scene  catharsic at it  s core  came i cried  and if you didn  t  you have serious problems  the story is archetypal  nothing new or original . but it  s real  because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist . glam isn  t my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early    s . . . at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine  docudramas never really work very good . but this movie really meked us believe it all . . . because they don  t try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts  present musicians that are superheroes  groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb  they don  t glorify drugs and alcohol  they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even   years late . . . once again great movie . since  leaving las vegas  i was never so moved by a movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1234 ===> i didn  t approach  still crazy  with any real anticipation . just another rock  n  roll picture  i figured . . . good nostalgia for the baby boomers . this film is partially that  but so much more . brian gibson  the director  previously helmed a biography of tina turner  and is quite successful in his style . i suppose it is fitting that this was his last film .  br    br   the cast is well  chosen . bill nighy is perfect in his role as the band  s frontman . actor  turned  director bruce robinson appears as the band  s washed  up guitarist . he does a superb job  even though he hasn  t appeared on film since the late    s . if you  re looking for an touching and funny film  with some great songs   you  ve found it .  br    br    .  out of    

=======================================================================================================

1235 ===> sorry did i miss something  did i walk out early  the first ten minutes of unusual  and untrue   stories had me thinking  this is going to be a classic  but it was all down hill from there  the acting was brilliant  for what it  s worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in . but it never seemed to connect . i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly . . it rains frog   it was if the writer said  i  ve gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely . . . . oh sod it i  ll just have it raining frogs  . i like clever movies  i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring .      

=======================================================================================================

1236 ===> great cast . great acting . unpredictable story line for the first half  br    br   hour or so . i was really wanting to know what was going to  br    br   happen to each of these unredeeming characters  and how their  br    br   seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined . but when  br    br   the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players  they  br    br   mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill  br    br   for the last two hours . i kept thinking it would get better  but it only  br    br   got worse . don  t believe the reviews . this is a waste of time .  br    br   think about it   tom cruise made ugly   why  the gorgeous  br    br   hunky bartender wearing braces   why  i know it had to do with  br    br   the plot  but without them  at least there would have been one  br    br   attractive cast member to remember .  

=======================================================================================================

1237 ===> i thought this movie was fantastic . it was hilarious . kinda reminded me of spinal tap . this is a must see for any fan of    s rock .  i hope me and my friends aren  t like that in twenty years    br    br   bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit   br    br   stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together  but not succeeding well .  br    br   if you love music  and were ever in a band  this movie is definitely for you . you won  t regret seeing this movie . i know i don  t . even my family found it funny  and that  s saying something .  

=======================================================================================================

1238 ===> as an aging rocker  this movie mentions heep and quo  my  favourite bands ever  but with the incredible cast  everyone   and the fantastic storyline  i just love this piece of creative genius . i cannot recommend it more highly  and mick jones added so much  foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever  lou gramm   i have watched this great work more than   times  bill nighy  what a voice  and jimmy nail  talent oozes from every pore  then astrid . . . . and karen . . . . . what more could an aging rocker ask for         bloody brilliant .  br    br   alastair  perth  western oz  originally from windsor  england .  

=======================================================================================================

1239 ===> i can  t tell you how angry i was after seing this movie . the characters are not the slightest bit interesting  and the plot is non  existant . so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other  hoping that the past  and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish  what do we get    a storm of frogs . now yes  i understand the references to the bible  exodus  and the underlying theme  but first of all  it was presented with absolutely no resolution  and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible  a significant portion of the population  or charles fort  a still larger portion  . as a somewhat well read person  i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode .  br    br   don  t waste your time . it would be better spent reading . . .  br    br   . . . well anything to be honest

1240 ===> the minute you give an  art film       you have people baying for your ignorant  half  ass  ed  artistically retarded blood . i won  t try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the  art house cinema  i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown  cult classic  a      . all i ask is that someone explain to me the point  purpose and message of this film .  br    br   here is how i would summarize the film opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co  incidence . this followed by  in a nutshell  to save you  hours of pain  the following  a children  s game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke  addicted daughter  who he may or may not have raped when she was a child  and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues  while the game  show  s star contestant decides that he doesn  t want to be a failed child prodigy  a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the   s  who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for  corrective oral surgery   while the game show  s producer  himself dying of lung cancer  asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago  and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru  even as mr . producer  s second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man and oh  eventually  it rains frogs  you read correctly  . and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless  literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than  possibly  to make sure the film crosses  hours and becomes classified as a  modern epic  .  br    br   you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie  and in turn of not confusing you  if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently  maybe in a few sentences instead of just one . . . well  now you know how i feel .  

=======================================================================================================

1241 ===> i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it . my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since .  br    br   the plot has been well  discussed  so no need in going over it again . the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings . americans  especially  aren  t going to get all the jokes the first time around . i know i didn  t .  br    br   this movie is funny  touching  sad   all at the same time . when ray proposes the toast at his daughter  s wedding  it  s cringe  inducing . when karen calls tony  brian  as he attempts to kiss her  it  s heartbreaking . when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black  it  s too funny for words .  br    br   and the music it  s as good as any movie soundtrack i  ve heard in years . i was dancing in the living room to  all over the world .   br    br   every performance is absolutely perfect . bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray  a man who has had one too many bad trips . stephen rea is perfect as tony  the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years . he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him . but all the actors are equally brilliant .  br    br   ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it . it  s a gem .  

=======================================================================================================

1242 ===> another example of the unique talents of cary grant . a performance worthy of oscar consideration  yet once again shunned by the academy . mr . grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city . the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis  loosely  for the more modern tom hanks vehicle   the money pit  .  br    br   if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex  this movie is a must see .  

=======================================================================================================

1243 ===> this movie is like real life  by which i mean  not a lot happens in the available  hours or so  and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast  their invisibility being due to the  experimental  lighting as mentioned by many reviewers  .  br    br   a big bore . no big surprise that altman helms this  he is a very variable performer  yes we all loved  gosford park   but  pret a porter  anyone  kansas city  dr t . and the women  aaargh   but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale  and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber  makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film . and no  it is not  so bad it  s good  .  br    br   it  s just bad .  

=======================================================================================================

1244 ===> i happened to love the show growing up  along with millions of others . so i tuned in to this movie  thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun .  br    br   wrong  i just have to wonder  at the end of this  was charlie  s angels really that boring  i don  t seem to remember it as such . but this movie  as bad as movies of this type can be  bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show . i did see it all  in spite of the negatives  it wasn  t unwatchable . but it was very bland  which i do not fault the performers for at all  particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them . the movie just wasn  t that interesting . it tried to make each angel a  character  .  one angel is to feisty  one is the  good girl   one is to into her husband . . . .   all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes . the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was . . . . dialog . that  s pretty much it .  br    br   not awful . not the worst of tv movies . but missable .  

=======================================================================================================

1245 ===> if you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening  this is the film for you  excellent script and perfectly cast actors . i especially loved ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs  inspired   

=======================================================================================================

1246 ===> so i rented  still crazy  instead . when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store  he said that sounded kind of like still crazy . so i rented it . was i disappointed  well  yes  as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band  but that  s ok . still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit  a rock band that broke up in the   s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival . twenty years later  the band members are all struggling to make a living  and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival . they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis  touring europe in the process . some quite funny hijinks ensue  and all the characters go through subtle changes . watching this movie  you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant . and that  s not bad at all .  

=======================================================================================================

1247 ===> noting the cast  i recently watched this movie on tcm  hoping for an under  appreciated gem  as i regard many films from the    s . this is no gem  not even semi  precious . the anachronistic clothing and      s rolls royce limo hit you immediately . the casting is strange  also . but mostly  there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices . this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise  but the components aren  t mixed according to the right recipe . it simply doesn  t come together like it should . and that  s a shame . with a few rather obvious  but minor alterations  this might have been a very good movie .  br    br   the film is about an american showgirl  jean harlow  seeking a rich british husband  preferably from the nobility . she meets franchot tone and his buddy  who are on a lark in a rolls royce owned by his buddy  s employer . harlow mistakenly assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls  and she sets her sights on him . this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction .  br    br   however  tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a german  th columnist on the eve of wwi  and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart . tone and harlow are married  but just as the honeymoon begins  he is gunned down by a mata hari  type  benita hume   and harlow flees the scene  with a bystander accusing her of tone  s murder .  in fact  tone recovers from the wounds .   br    br   harlow flees to france  where she falls in love again  this time with a wealthy french cad  cary grant  . tone  now in the army  and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in grant  s hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash . in the following scene  tone accuses harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold  digger . harlow never explains about the witness  accusing her of murder and her panic  that is one of those unreal  movie  plot  device break  downs in the story .  br    br   then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman  hume  who shot him . she is on hand to watch her paramour  grant  test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england . incredibly  both hume and tone dimly recognize each other  but simply can  t place where from  okay  so tone was shot and almost died perhaps his memory is a little out of whack . but how many men did hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks   she does not seem to be faking the memory lapse .   br    br   this is inexplicable and unnecessary . hume should have absolutely recognized him  but played it coy when she realized that tone wasn  t able to place her . that would have been a much better treatment of that issue .  br    br   the finale also is very unsatisfying . the movie  as made  has tone and harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad  grant  leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero . then harlow and tone just walk away . it is noble to preserve the french public  s perception of their national war hero  but very unsatisfying as a love story   br    br   what the film begs for is this harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her he then carries a torch for her  even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve grant  s reputation . meanwhile  harlow finally recognizes grant for the cad he is . then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is  harlow rekindles feelings for him  too . at film  s end  the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of grant  s death . after grant  s hero  s burial  we see them embrace and kiss at the fade  out . that would have made a nice little movie . for cary grant fans  it would have been even better had tone played the french cad who is killed and grant the long  suffering first husband  reunited with harlow .  br    br   it is incomprehensible that franchot tone is cast as the irishman living in england  while cary grant is cast as the frenchman . this movie would have been much better had they reversed roles . that also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1248 ===> this may have been made for the hell of it  but it was most probably the worst film i  ve seen in years  the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case    i  m surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too  i  m glad i only rented . i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter  i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future  that is  if he is still in work .  br    br   notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing  don  t buy it       

=======================================================================================================

1249 ===> this reminded me of spinal tap  on a more serious level . it  s the story of a band doing a reunion tour  but things are not harmonious between them . i was especially impressed with the performance of bill nighy as ray . you felt sorry for him  yet he had a certain creepiness about him . it  s a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly  old and pathetic . bittersweet  highly recommended . .  

=======================================================================================================

1250 ===>   contrary to most reviews i  ve read  i didn  t feel this followed any of the other rock movies   spinal tap   etc .  the story was more unique  although i feel most people wanted to see the  sex  drugs  rock and roll  vices that the band kept alluding to .  br    br    as an american  i knew a few of the actors  spall  connelly  rea . surprised to find out  brian   bruce robinson was in zifferedi  s   sp   classic  romeo  juliet  . guess i  ll have to rent that next .  br    br     the flame still burns   my wife  who hails from mexico  didn  t follow the english  british language too well  missed some of the jokes  which i dutifully explained  but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene . she loves the song so much now .  br    br    funny that amazon . com has the soundtrack for    usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal  mart for   .   usd . price non  withstanding  i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since .  

=======================================================================================================

1251 ===> it surprisingly had a plot    i  ve seen movies with less plot  i don  t wanna mention asian movies but . . .  . i thought the camera wasn  t bad at all for a cheap movie like this  and also the atmosphere wasn  t too bad . there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens . although i do think that about a lot of movies  in this case it was horrible  of course .  br    br   it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes . the acting was bad but i  ve seen worse . the movie was bad but i  ve seen worse . watching this film is an experience between boredom  laughing fits  death wish  sadism  horniness and entertainment on a low level .  br    br   so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you .  br    br   i gave it      because it can be entertaining if you don  t expect to see a good movie and you  re in the right mood .  

=======================================================================================================

1252 ===> not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half  way through . . . . but then with this one  i was only   minutes in when i considered . unfortunately  i did make it all the way through . make sure that you do not .  br    br   it  s not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual . it  s that it  s not any of those things  yet it so desperately wants to be all of them . instead  it  s boring  trite  ordinary  predictable  and unexceptionally poorly executed  shot on video  high school special effects  no sense of even basic visual storytelling  dialog barely audible . . . not that it  s worth hearing  though  .  br    br   this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight  to  video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere .  

=======================================================================================================

1253 ===> i  m   years old  a guitarist   lead  rhythm   and over the last forty years  i  ve been in four bands  it  s all there  the fights  the foul  ups  the rotten food  the worse accommodation  always travelling  little or no money  and every one was drunk or high . but  the clubs  the fans  and the music  made it all worth it  just like strange fruit  i  m too damn old for it now  and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking  but for the length of that video  it all came back  and it was all there  the birds  the brawls  and the booze  and i was young again  it  s just like billy connolly  s voice over  god likes that    s stuff  rock on forever   

=======================================================================================================

1254 ===>  . . . heads  hands  and feet  a band from the past  just like strange fruit . a triple whammy there . those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under    and have had no experience of the real thing . sad for them . this is an achingly well  observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two  and will probably not even fade much on the second showing . stephen rae  timothy spall as the fat drummer  in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all   and bill nighy  a new name for me  as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances  and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen  who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self  destruct .  br    br   the syd barrett  brian wilson echoes are loud and clear  mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness  and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute . don  t compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty  it  s unfair on all of them . the nearest comparison is the commitments  and that  s no bad thing . and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig  a band i do not remember ever seeing  but the name lives on  well  it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about .  br    br   a small delight  and thanks for the memory .  br    br   oh . . . and i  ve got another one  stiff little fingers a  a  and what about steeleye span . . . spooky tooth . . . ten inch nails anyone   you have to see the movie or have been on the road   

=======================================================================================================

1255 ===> by all accounts  this could have been an interesting film . featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth  starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as  the future of british horror   i expected alex chandon  s gore fest to live up to the hype .  br    br   i was wrong .  br    br   everything about this film is either cliche or inept . the short story anthology setup was done to death  and much better  in the seventies and eighties . admittedly  the idea of  the sick room  did send a chill down my spine  but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting .  br    br   chandon cannot write dialogue . every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence  the typical  cop on the edge  formula . funny  i  m sure i  ve seen that somewhere else before . . .  no chandon  you are not tarantino . or scorsese . it sounds bad . add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting  don  t get me wrong  dani filth is a great singer and musician  but actor he ain  t  and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing . give me bruce campbell any day .  br    br   the visual effects are on the whole poor  with some atrocious cgi  awful gore effects  for goodness sakes  peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget  and editing filters that shriek over  use  as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth  s score . . . man  they should sue .  br    br   the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously  trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience . too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects  eg maniac  zombie flesh eaters  the beyond  suspiria etc   rendering cradle of fear  in my mind  second  rate and obsolete .  br    br   i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares .  br    br   better luck next time .  

=======================================================================================================

1256 ===> normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b  horror movies . to me the basic principals behind a b  horror movie is it  s camp value  heavy gore  lots of needless nudity  and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex . i rented cradle of fear strictly because i  ve been a fan of the band since they released they  re first demo in     . the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed . when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder . i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn  t laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi  million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi  hundreds of dollars . the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the  hardcore goth kids who think death  destruction  sex  blood  and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps . that was really it . to me this movie seemed like   .   of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic . this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this  movie  really is just an extended cradle of filth video .  

=======================================================================================================

1257 ===> musings pure delight from beginning to end . not a laugh riot  but a more subtle  sophisticated humor . what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors  including reginald denny  nestor paiva  ian wolfe  harry shannon and jason robards sr . .  br    br   cary grant is at the building sight of his new home  which is at that point  being framed . a young carpenter  played by future tarzan lex barker  asks him if he wants his  lallies to be rabbeted   or some such thing that only a carpenter would know . grant  not wanting to appear ignorant  replies in the affirmative . at that  barker yells up to his mates   ok boys  he wants  em rabbeted  so . . . . yank  em out   a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about   big nails being pulled out of various boards . all grant can do is moan .  br    br   yes  the movie is dated . you  d never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home  and a place like that  in connecticut of all places  would probably run a few million bucks .  br    br   a classic movie that is really a treasure .  

=======================================================================================================

1258 ===> what a good movie  at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock illusions of fame . well  known rockers are getting old and forgotten  not the music . and with a good sense of humour . have you ever danced on bill haley  s rock around the clock   br    br   anyway  still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n  roll i have ever seen . far much better than spinal tap for instance . why  because in still crazy  people are mature . they have a different point of view about rock  about love and about life . they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much . beyond the story itself  we see characters with their own personality  weaknesses and dreams . like anyone of us .  br    br   spend a good time watching this  listen to the awesome soundtrack   and finally thinking of your own future .  br    br   bye   

=======================================================================================================

1259 ===> this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat . having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie . admittedly  i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it . dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead . the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor . there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie . for being low budget  the special effects weren  t bad either . the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish .  br    br   now on to the cons . there is very little talking throughout this whole movie  thus making for very little as far as character development . it  s hard to fear for the lives of limp  static characters . when there was a little talking  the f bomb was abundant  popping up in random places . yes  i understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language . the storyline  what i could make out of it  was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what  s happening .  br    br   in the end  cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence  but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline  it just doesn  t work too well . rent it though  if you  re a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite .  

=======================================================================================================

1260 ===> this movie was made for fans of dani  and cradle of filth  . i am not one of them . i think he  s just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon  still  i  m generally not a fan of black metal  . but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it  i convinced myself  that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing . thus i assumed i  m in for a roller  coaster ride of rubber gore and do  it  yourself splatter with a sinister background . now  that is what i do like .  br    br   i got home and popped it in . my patience lasted   minutes . awful camera work and disgusting quality . and that was then        that it looked like it was shot using a hi  camcorder . i left it on the shelf . maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this . . . picture .  br    br   after a couple of months i got back to it  in mentioned surroundings  and saw half . then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me . my disliking evolved . i noticed how funny dani      m     height  looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart .  yes  ripping . his head apparently had no skull .  i also found that this movie may have no sense . still  i haven  t finished it yet  so i wasn  t positive .  br    br   after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick  a couple of months back . . .  yes  it took me    years .  so  dani in fact was funny as satan  manson  super  evil  man  s helper and the movie did not make sense . see our bad person employs dani to do bad things . he delivers . why  well i guess he  s just very  very bad . as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it .  br    br   we have a couple of short stories joined by dani  s character . my favourite was about a guy  who steals someone  s leg  because he wants to use it as his own . yeah  exactly .  br    br   the acting  s rock bottom . the cgi is the worst ever . i mean stinger beats it  and  boy  is stinger  s cgi baaaaad  . the story has no sense . and the quality is . . . let  s just say it is not satisfying . the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore . blood and guts are made pretty well . why  you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on .  example  dani  the man  filth takes a stuffed cat  fake as can be  and guts it . . . and then eats what fell out . why  we never know . we do know  however  that this cat must have been on illegal substances  as his heart is almost half his size .   br    br   you might think  after my comment that this movie is so bad it  s good  but it  s just bad . cradle of filth fans can add  points . i added one for gore .

1262 ===> this movie is tremendous for uplifting the spirits .  br    br   every time i watch it  i see  hear funny little things that i missed before .  br    br   the soundtrack is unbelievable . mick jones  foreigner  and chris difford  squeeze  penned the songs  making strange fruit the best thing that ever hit today  s music scene .  br    br   unfortunately  strange fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up     s to    s band that were never good to begin with  due to drug use and inner fighting . one wonders what might have been  while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack .  br    br   the fruit draw inspiration from the rolling stones  deep purple  david bowie  and the who .  br    br   each member of fruit are quite memorable . stephen rea stars as down  and  dead  broke tony costello  who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour  with hopes of reaping monetary benefits . costello haply approaches ex  roadie karen knowles  played by juliet aubrey  to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past .  br    br   juliet gathers up the bitter jimmy nail  les wickes   blundering timothy spall  david  beano  baggot   and extravagantly glamouresque ray simms  bill nighy  . tumbling in is another ex  roadie  the hippy  toker  jokester hughie  billy connolly   who never let the flame burn out .  br    br   as juliet searches for the last member of their motley band  the elusive guitarist  songwriter brian lovell  played by the brooding bruce robinson   the reunited members squabble  just like old times  fighting over each others  rusty talent .  br    br   the band is then given the chance to do a small dutch tour  to prepare for the festival . with young hendrix  like luke shand  hans matheson  taking the place of lovell  the crew hits the road . the sparks fly as their memories flame forward  threatening to burn their unfinished goals . . .  br    br   be prepared to laugh  sing  cheer  and cry  as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts . . .

1263 ===>  . . . and you can look at that statement in different ways  by the way . first of all  it  s a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes . your wildest imagination doesn  t even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here . entire parts of this movie are just plain sick  disgusting  offensive  brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out . now  i love horror movies and i am very  pro  violence   but i do think that it has to lead somewhere   is that too much to ask  cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts . the  movie  contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story . this results in endless showing of torture  murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common . not very informative  if you ask me . and yet  it has to be said  the basic plot idea surely has potential . it  s about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial . personally  i think that is an interesting topic  so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever .  br    br   secondly  the whole production of this movie was a mess . they didn  t have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts . . . tons of it   the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst i  ve ever seen . any other special effects besides the make  up looks very amateurish  like that attempt to a realistic car crash  for example  . there  s no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere . . . not even an attempt to build up one .  br    br   cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least . with the presence of death  metal icon danni filth  from the band cradle of filth . . get the link   this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial . troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this . and then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing . . . bah . i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you  re easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind . for every self  respecting horror fan  this movie is an insult .  

=======================================================================================================

1264 ===> cradle of fear  br    br   this isn  t a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention . this is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack  jacked uttering that sense of whoa . what it is though is a slice of lo  fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination  created in the eyes of the director  alex chandon  as  a throwback to sleazy    s and    s horror  .  br    br   this is a very visceral experience for  hours  where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood  reams of dismembered body parts and innards  tied by an intestinal thread of revenge .  br    br   the purveyor of such horrific violence is dani filth  lead  singer of the metal band cradle of filth  executing a role he was destined to play .  br    br   as other  s have said  there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge . in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer  kemper  the father of our devilish avenging  angel  compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum .  br    br   what this provides for the chandon  who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece  is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free . he seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen  and into every nook and cranny that can be reached . we are also treated to close  ups of skull  s being crushed  demonic rape  and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror . and for some of those who closely follow these type of films  there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking   did i just see what i thought i did   because of course pretty woman this  aint . it reminds me of some of the gore  fests created out of italian horror some   to   years ago  and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed .  br    br   story  of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the  sick room   where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out . further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent  and an effective use of drum and bass  often overlooked in film  making as a viable form of supporting visuals . using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand  ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film . ok  classic it may not be  but blood  guts  intestines  occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is .  

=======================================================================================================

1265 ===> looking back over the past   years  since my first exposure to the show   all i can say is once you get it  it will stay with you forever . i remember my initial reaction being   annoyingly overacted    under produced   unlikeable characters  br    br   well  two years later i watched some episodes again and didn  t find it nearly as annoying . a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it  s bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness . yes  the show has a style that is not for everybody  and i  m sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now . but  i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times . . .  br    br   btw i am a married man . . .  for all who think this is a show for females   

=======================================================================================================

1266 ===> british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet  introspective  usually romantic study and the farcical social satire . settings  characters  and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories . butterflies is perhaps the epitom of the first type .  br    br   the scripts are very verbal  including long interior monologues by the main character ria  a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life . when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman  who makes his interest in her quite clear   she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered .  br    br   the acting and scripts are always on the money  which makes one  s reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one i was neither blown away by it nor turned off . my mother  on the other hand  adored this show . i think the degree to which one identifies with ria  s dilemma is the most important factor in determining one  s reaction to butterflies .  

=======================================================================================================

1267 ===> now look  i won  t lie to you  but i only got this movie for   .   from a friend because it had danni filth  the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band  cradle of filth  in it . i expected of course violence and gore at its finest  as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as  amongst a plot line .  br    br   but dear god  i was oh so wrong . this movie seriously bites  big time . being a low budget film  haha  wait  make that zero budget   this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects . nope  it  s all one camera  bad angles  and bad blood scenes .  br    br   take for example when our star and violent fiend  mr filth  violently kills a mugger . a grab at the throat  and blood spits out  but oh my  it looks like there  s a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man  s shirt .  br    br   to you cradle of filth fans you  ll hear two songs throughout the movie  but with the camera angles and shoddy filming  they drag the overall pleasure of the song down .  br    br   my final comment steer well away from it . it  s blood  gore  breasts  and hey  even a shoddy story to go with it . so if you like appalling violence  near no voices  yes  there  s hardly any words in this movie   then by all means  buy it . but if shoddy movies isn  t your thing  then avoid it . don  t waste your money .  

=======================================================================================================

1268 ===> check out the film  s website  more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie . it couldn  t be more off in it  s boasting . original story  original  they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament  or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn  tooting . high  end special effects  come on  i could do better with an atari     and a jug of earwax . stylish cinematography  oh yes  the america  s funniest home video look is still a classic . i  m sure they had little money available for this title  so of course the sf aren  t really that good  or a bit bad now and then  or just plain hilarious  but it  s the story that makes this film a waste of time and money .  stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen  befores and done  already  s .  

=======================================================================================================

1269 ===> enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama  the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man  no doubt representing modern society . i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long . i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie  the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest . on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce  yes sir  and  sorry  into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone  they are still there .  

=======================================================================================================

1270 ===> not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name  this is a stylised look at hong kong  s triad gangs . called election because a new leader or  chairman  is elected by ancient traditions every two years . two candidates are up for the position and through ego  bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least . expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory . the asian godfather this is not  but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence . subtitled volume  i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals . either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right .  

=======================================================================================================

1271 ===> this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it . all aspects of the film  script  acting  direction  are mediocre . the acting by the three leads is wooden . i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work . lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction . jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers . the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen  the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange . the dvd transfer is typical alpha .  

=======================================================================================================

1272 ===> did anyone who was making this movie  particularly the director  spare a thought for the logic of the story  line  these are not mere plot  holes  but plot graves  that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight . that is  if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave  hole plot  or boring and unlikeable . or  in the case of downey  s  hannah  s characters  apparently superfluous . in pondering the reason for existence of downey  s character  s significant screen  time in the movie  i decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen  time  unlikley  as the director didn  t change anything else about the script he actually needed to  or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting . i  ll leave you to guess which one it was to be .  br    br   i had to keep checking the cover of the dvd to confirm that this really was made by credible talents . i cannot understand why robert altman would take this job . surely he has some power to pick and chose . actually  i can  t understand why anyone would take this script on  except a first  time director looking for the experience .  br    br   i suppose robert downey jr . needed the money for his habit . i suppose kenneth branagh wanted to try a southern accent . i suppose robert duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing . these are the only motivations i can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie . as for robert altman  plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic . i found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene  or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye  s movements  or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood . i do not typically notice such things in movies  since most movies i bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story  telling and interesting characters with understandable motives . i watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that dvd cover and being convinced that  due to the talent involved  there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie .  br    br   nice direction . but that  s not why i watch movies .  

=======================================================================================================

1273 ===> this isn  t as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective .  br    br   there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who  s side a particular character is on .  br    br   the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows .  br    br   the violence when it comes is brutal  no guns or martial art scenes with special effects  this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation .  br    br   the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable .  

=======================================================================================================

1274 ===> there can be no denying that hak se wui  election in english  is a well made and well thought out film . the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition  a theme played with throughout the film where john woo  s hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled       and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the  bad  point of view  they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable  a good example being city on fire       .  br    br   election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes  spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful  if that  s the right word  manner as well as the clever little  in pieces  of film  making . it  s difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in  not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say  goes . the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run . needless to say certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds  some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular .  br    br   election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third . trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points . i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested . this happens a few times a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested there  s a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested some other triads are having a pre  election talk but the police show up and guess what  you know .  br    br   once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would  it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving . the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it  s been hotwired  another chase involving a motorbike and a kung  fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street  the scenes are unpredictable  realistic and violent but like i said  they are in a  tasteful  manner . where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail . when the triads are in jail  the bars are covered with wire suggesting they  re all animals in cages as that  s how they behave on the outside when in conflict . another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol  elevating themselves above other head gangsters who  d use champagne  the long good friday  and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate .  br    br   election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise  en  scene as you look at what  s going on . some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies . the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film hinting at chinese tradition in the process . i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic  unpredictable and violent in a tasteful manner  of course .  

=======================================================================================================

1275 ===> maybe i  m missing something because i  ve read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews  and i just don  t get it . i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak  look  and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura . none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it . take the lead actor  lee j . cobb . his rumpled  rolled  out  of  bed look is about as far from the dashing  smooth  talking noir archetype as you  ll find . or  take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example . this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i  ve seen in a while . she  s just not convincing in the role .  br    br   as for the plot  it  s tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre . i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes . and that final cat  and  mouse chase scene is plain old dull . ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it .  

=======================================================================================================

1276 ===> i watched like  or  herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me .  br    br   i watched several documentaries about him . he is obviously an intelligent man  with great knowledge about films and passion for making them  but does this makes him a good director . definitely no  a complete anti  talent . he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits  but a film with actors  never   br    br   he can  t direct nor write . his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations  and many situations  dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word  art  in any sense . no way . not to mention the unskillful direction  so amateurish  like . to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie .  br    br   like the scene when scheitz gets arrested and storszek hides in the back of the store . who is he kidding   br    br   he is a cheater he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want . he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising . never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction .  br    br   just look at julio medem . if herzog can make a movie like medem can  then i might re  check his old movies and try to find talent in them .  

=======================================================================================================

1277 ===> first off  i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence . i say unfortunately  because after seeing election  first  election seems a bit of a disappointment . both films are gangster epics that are similar in form . and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema . . . it  s just not nearly as good as it  s sequel .  br    br   in the first election installment  we are shown the two competitors for chairman big d and lok . after a few scenes of discussion amongst the  uncle  s  as to who should have the chairman title  they  almost unanimously  decide that lok  simon yam  will helm the triads . suffice to say this doesn  t go over very well with competitor big d  tony leung ka fai  and in a bid to influence the takeover  big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side . this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war . lok is determined to become chairman but won  t become official until he can recover the  dragon head baton   a material representation of the chairman  s power . the current chairman  whistle  chung wang  has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first .  br    br   much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton . as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides  which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election  which involves an underling named jet  nick cheung   a machete  and lots of bad guys . nick cheung  s presence is attention grabbing to say the least . . . i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election  as he does deliver more of jet  s character in the sequel .  br    br   while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance  i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film  s actors . election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting . simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo  tony leung ka fai  and the under  appreciated suet lam . there really aren  t any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they  re watching real gangsters .  br    br   although the performances are great  one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to  s eye for the camera . there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots  as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles . all of which makes election  above all  a great looking film .  br    br   my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election . it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren  t integral to the plot . while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates  the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles  underlings  and police officers crowding the storyline . maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad  or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more .  br    br   bottom line  all in all  this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast  excellent direction  and leisurely pacing that packs a punch . it  s just a little more complicated than it needed to be .  

=======================================================================================================

1278 ===> it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films  but i think it  s the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena . it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku  s yakuza opus the yakuza papers  aka battles without honour and humanity   in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic  dark and gritty . but it  s also a johnnie to film  and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur .  br    br   every two years the hk triad elects a new boss . only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police . that  s the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that . as in the yakuza papers  there  s a great deal of scheming  back  stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances  sometimes all it takes is a phone call  in one of the most memorable scenes i  ve seen in recent time  which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict . fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect . election is not as action  oriented as one might expect although it is violent . and i  m not talking about the glossy  glamour version of hollywood violence . this is dark and grim . to  s camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not .  br    br   if you  re familiar with to  s style  then you should know what to expect . the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate . the cinematography is great  slick and dark in equal measures  utilizing dark hues  brown  dark green and orange  while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it . in the end  election occupies a peculiar place . it  s not exactly a character study and it  s not an action  oriented gangster film . it explores a situation  the election and its aftermath   but does so in style  and is both realistic and romanticized  the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather  .  

=======================================================================================================

1279 ===> the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take  hours of my life  actually it was only   minutes  was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema . all i have ever seen were few older movies of s . ray .  br    br   browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of  .  i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment . oh my how wrong i was  the only logical explanation for this rating of  .  is that most of    people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies .  br    br   with this rating this movie would be ranked on  th place on imdb list of    best movies above citizen cane  goodfellas of psycho  i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience . my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is   plain stupid  with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music .  

=======================================================================================================

1280 ===> i love the munna bhai mbbs but  lagge raho . . .  sux really sux . i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life . and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers    br    br   may be spoiler  br    br   an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai  people discussing their personal prob . on phones come on man from which part of the world u r    i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible .  br    br    out of   .   stars is for   mins good starting   

=======================================================================================================

1281 ===> johnnie to  s election has some cool music on the opening creditsand a nice opening credits  design too  a kaleidoscope of chinese characters and those asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored . i have found about to from bishop seraphim sigrist and was quite eager to see a to movie . the one with which i began  election  is exciting and interesting  and only moderately violent by nowadays standardsmoderately and also essentially violent the story of an asian godfather  s scheming  it uses a puzzle play of elements  violent facts from the mobsters  lives  the race for the scepter  true details  and as with coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable . the performances are reasonably amusing and colorful .  br    br   election is well made in the enjoyable  somewhat careless style of the hong kong fare the ending is bitter  true  straight and will scare the kids .

1282 ===> i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival  where i went when i was in hollywood  that this film was in screening . basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up  so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this . the struggle is between  candidates  lam lok  simon yam  and big d  tony leung ka fai  for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society . also starring louis koo as jimmy lee  nick cheung as jet  cheung siu fai as mr . so  lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun . there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments  just about enough action  apart from maybe when the cops get involved  but a sequel followed  so it  s a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller . very good   

=======================================================================================================

1283 ===> this is a film that makes you say  things . . .   i can do much better than this  acting  writing and directing    this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others . . .  br    br   looks as if it was shot with my flip video . i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me . i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film . one of the worst  movies i have ever seen . hopefully the writers and director leave the business . not even talented enough to do commercials

1284 ===> with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler   the art of seduction  fails to deliver the romantic  sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as . the two main characters have the potential to be interesting  both male and female lead are  swinging singles  or in the female lead  s case  engaged    but  the art of seduction  doesn  t even try . shirking from a frank examination of these two characters  personalities   the art of seduction  eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin  lean stereotype .  br    br    the art of seduction  is insulting  insulting to its characters  insulting to men and women  and insulting to its audiences  expectations . it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them . ji  wan is an immature  spoiled  manipulative bitch . the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she  s pretty . min  jun  well  he  s exactly the same . neither are nice people . the  humour  in this film primarily revolve around ji  wan and min  jun  s outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation . no character development occurs  and we never learn why ji  wan and min  jun are like this . we are simply expected to take them as they are  and not ask questions  they  re cute   and that  s all that matters . the copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester  s reviews may tip you off to  art of seduction  s shallowness .  br    br   if you  re still in high school  you liked grease  or you are a yellow fever victim  you may like this movie .  br    br   despite its  romance  tag  this is not a very good date movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1285 ===> the first of two films by johnny to  this film won many awards  but none so prestigious as a cannes golden palm nomination .  br    br   the triad elects their leader  but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations .  br    br   tony leung ka fai  zhou yu  s train  ashes of time redux  is big d  who plans to take the baton no matter what it takes  even if it means a war . well  war is not going to happen as that is bad for business . big d will change his tune or . . .  br    br   good performances by simon yam  louis koo and ka tung lam  infernal affairs i  iii   along with tony leung ka fai .  br    br   whether masons  made men in the mafia  or members of the wo sing society  the ceremonies are the same fascinating to watch .  br    br   to be continued . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1286 ===> this movie is a little unusual in that it  s got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace . while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film  it is still highly watchable and entertaining . it  s sort of like someone said  let  s just follow cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed  . considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and melvin douglas  the film works very well . while the film has pretty modest pretensions  it makes the most of the material . it  s a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family .  

=======================================================================================================

1287 ===> in spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree gingerbread man crumbles early and often . the plot is unrealistically convoluted  the actors sport bad accents and director robert altman  s participation amounts to collecting a pay check . once again he has assembled an impressive cast  like woody allen  everyone wants to work with altman  that this time around to the letter is miscast . but that  s only part of the problem .  br    br   kenneth branagh is rick magruder a high powered georgia lawyer who in the film  s heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex  husband and a loony dad . with red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way . fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that  s not enough there  s a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale .  br    br   branagh plays macgruder with a mealy and unconvincing southern accent . running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he  s blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going . hipster bob downey jr . is every bit as bad as a p . i . but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent . robert duvall as the old man is boo radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible . the female leads  embeth davidtz  darryl hannah  famkhee jansen  are lean leggy and unemotive . even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos  vernon jordan  are wooden with the few throw away lines they have .  br    br   in addition to paying little attention to his actors  altman  s mise en scene dripping with spanish moss is murky and shapeless  his action scenes comic book . it lacks his offbeat touches and observations  he does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still wave in georgia  that make a well done altman so unique . unfortunately  gingerbread man is altman at his worst  even if the pay is the same .  

=======================================================================================================

1288 ===> bill  buddy rogers  is sent to new york by his uncle  richard tucker  to experience life before he inherits    million . his uncle has paid  women jacqui  kathryn crawford   maxine  josephine dunn  and pauline  carole lombard  to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold  diggers . one such lady cleo  geneva mitchell  turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women . we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the  months that bill is in new york  while bill meets with cleo and another woman . at the end  love is in the air for bill and one other . . . . . . . . . . . . .  br    br   the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film . the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice . rogers isn  t that good either . he  s pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone . there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver  roscoe karns  and the film is just dull .  

=======================================================================================================

1289 ===> despite a tight narrative  johnnie to  s election feels at times like it was once a longer picture  with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved . some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel  election   harmony is a virtue  but it  s still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions  though not the violence  in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call . it  s also a film where the most ruthless character isn  t always the most threatening one  as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander .  br    br   simon yam  all too often a variable actor but always at his best under to  s direction  has possibly never been better in the lead  not least because tony leung  s much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful .  

=======================================================================================================

1290 ===> election marks the  nd trial society theme movie directed by johnnie to .  br    br   to marvellously casted simon yan and tony leung kar fai as lok and big d  as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for ho sing society  a    year old trial society .  br    br   while lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times  big d is not only impatient  but also thinks that he is on top of everything . lok was chosen as the next chairman for  years . to have the total control of the gang  the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a dragon baton  which represents power and authority . big d was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members . he ordered his man to get the baton before it falls onto the hands of lok .  br    br   while big d is getting the baton  lok has other plans for him .  br    br   this is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed . johnnie to puts the greed of the human beings in the movie  where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one . however  no single bullet is used  hardly any gangfights are involved in election . it  s the battle of the wits that makes election stands out of the rest .  br    br   apart from maggie shiu  the only actress in election with less than  lines to talk in the whole movie  masculinity rules the whole movie . louis koo and nick cheung  who was seen in to  s previous film  are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively . together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script  it makes the only hk movie to represent cannes fil festival     .  br    br   election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1291 ===> here  s an indie film i really wanted to like  but ultimately could not . the lack of script  boldly proclaimed in the main titles  really shows through and kills the picture . the story is a nonsensical mess that isn  t worth trying to figure out . i quickly became bored within   minutes  then suffered through the remainder of the first   minutes   hoping for the best   before hitting the chapter stops to  mercifully  get to the end . . . even that wasn  t worth the extra effort . ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever  lifting its best sequences from evil dead  and the matrix . as a result  there  s very little in ozark savage that hasn  t been done before  and better . this film would have been much more fun as a      minute short  but as a feature  it just feels padded and forced . of course  there  s no money in shorts  so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to    minutes . director matt steinauer shows great promise  and i wish him luck .  

=======================================================================================================

1292 ===> many people thought that this is a good movie but i don  t agree with them . at the beginning of the movie  a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship  then hey killed some people on the earth  but for no reason . also  it is in a dark forest  i can  t see anything on the screen  i can only hardly hear the sound .  br    br   after a few days  the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that  he should not know what happened on the earth  so there is a contradiction . finally  the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason . he was not live on earth  t is none of his business about the things happened here . lastly  the duration of the movie is only   minutes long  the summary is too short and it can  t tell the reviewers about the story clearly .  br    br   in conclusion  i don  t think this is a good movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1293 ===>   br    br   i must admit  i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of  cut  last night  though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem . i am a true horror fan as true as they come  and found  cut  to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced  but one of the great parody  comedy films of late .  br    br   my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements  the film was not overly clever in it  s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could . i am certain this was intended as humour . . . . hoping this was intended as humour .  br    br   and of course  there was the gore .  br    br   the use of the  customised  garden shears was brilliance  besides the expected stabs and slashes . in short  there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths  enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth .  br    br   the appearance of both kylie minogue  short that her appearance was  and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film  both performances were fantastic  as well as simon bossell   the castle   in a brilliant role as the jokey technician .  br    br   all in all  i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years  as well as a beautiful satire  parody  toungue  in  cheek till the very end .  br    br   loved it . go see it   

=======================================================================================================

1294 ===> australia  s first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang . and a stab . and a slice . and a scream or two . and plenty of blood  frights  red herrings and lots of laughs .  br    br   in fact  there  s lots of first surrounding cut  it  s the first script of dave warner  s to be produced  although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation it  s the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall and it  s also the first film for producer martin fabinyi . and for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time  they sure know their stuff .  br    br   cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film  hot blooded  that was never finished because its director  hilary  kylie minogue   was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film .  br    br   despite their lecturer  who was assistant director on the night hilary died  warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies  director raffy  jessica napier  and producer hester  sarah kants  decide to go ahead and complete the film . they put together a crew and manage to get the original star  vanessa turnbill  molly ringwald   to return to australia  in fact  to the original location  to complete hot blooded    years after shooting shut down .  br    br   of course  this being a slasher film  lots of bloodletting ensues  long with plenty of laughs  a few good scares and a rocking aussie soundtrack . cut shows that australia can make a good  mass  market horror film just as well as hollywood .  br    br   it  s a finely crafted feature  with excellent special effects  a taut plot and a killer  scarman  that  s a welcome addition to the ranks of michael  jason and freddy .  

=======================================================================================================

1295 ===> saw this  film  recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see . what the hell was going on with coolio  totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress . totally uninvolving  slow  tedious and detached . worse than spawn . long live  evil dead ii  .  

=======================================================================================================

1296 ===> what the hell of a d  movie was that  bad acting  bad special effects and the worst dialogues  storyline i ever came across . the only cool thing here was coolio  who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop . however  the rest of the film is awful and boring . it  s not even so bad  you can laugh about it . just plain crap . and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones  well  ok  at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider    out of    

=======================================================================================================

1297 ===> i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was  the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was . well that was because it isn  t supposed to be taken so seriously  basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job . . there seems to be another movie coming out like that too  umm . . . scary movie   well this is aussie  and original    jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting  i hope to see more of them . molly ringwald was a good move  and kylie was an even better move . the impossible princess was queen of the screen   i recommend seeing this flick  as you  ll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy  hilary and the movie that never got finished   years ago .  

=======================================================================================================

1298 ===> personally  i enjoyed cut thouroughly . it was the first time i  ve seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick . a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films .  br    br   with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn  t a rip off of anything . i didn  t even think it was really a spoof of other movies . it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street  not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief . i think it  s about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres .  br    br   cut was original  scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun . i  d give it seven out of ten and wouldn  t treat it as anything serious . it did what i expected it to do  entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying . i enjoyed it .  

=======================================================================================================

1299 ===> this film is so much of a rip  off of the masterpeice  demons  and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching . the acting is terrible  the action scenes are speeded up  the script is almost painful and budget non existent .  br    br   if you think this film is good then you havn  t seen a real horror film  skip this and get a copy of the movie demons .  

=======================================================================================================

1300 ===> lame  lame  lame    a    minute cringe  fest that  s   minutes too long . a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility  an abandoned convent  is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky  witless dialogue that  s straining oh  so  hard to be hip . mostly it  s just embarrassing  and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat  a sample of this movie  s dialogue after demonstrating her artillery  fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau  s vigilante charactershe any questions   hyuck hyuck hyuck  . bad acting  idiotic  homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects  it looks like the director  s watched the evil dead  way too many times .  br    br   i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they  ll never get back . what a turd .  

=======================================================================================================

1301 ===> there is so much to love in this darling little comedy . anyone who has ever built or bought a house  or even just been short of space  will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr . blanding . melvyn douglas  with great comedic flare  both narrates and acts as the blandings  attorney and voice of reason . as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife . but the best performance is grant  s . he is the american everyman  especially relevant at the time of this film  s release  when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war . the themes are universal  lack of money  work strain  fear of infidelity . yes  it does wrap up awfully neatly  but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war  and wanted a happy ending . it is still relevant today  and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down  gross out comedies . the look of the film is slick  and there are some great bits of comedy is well  particularly toward the beginning . while it may have lost some of it  s social relevance  nearly sixty years after it  s release  it is still a gem .  

=======================================================================================================

1302 ===> it isn  t the worst film ever made  the actors aren  t apalling and the script and director are not completely inept .  br    br   it isn  t the best film ever made  the actors aren  t excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant .  br    br   it falls somewhere in the middle . a fun somewhere . an enjoyable  well constructed somewhere .  br    br   no need to say  don  t take it seriously  or  so bad its good  or  it wasn  t scary  . none of these comments are relevant .  br    br   cut has atmosphere . it  s that atmosphere which is actually very unique  and the one really original aspect of the movie  which personally is what makes the film  for me .  

=======================================================================================================

1303 ===> this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen  and i have quite an appetite for awful  and good  movies . it could  just  have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue  in  cheek    la rocky horror picture show  which was really very funny . other movies  like plan nine from outer space  manage to be funny while  apparently  trying to be serious . as to the acting  it looks like they rounded up brain  dead teenagers and asked them to ad  lib the whole production . compared to them  tom cruise looks like alec guinness . there was one decent interpretation   that of the older ghoul  busting broad on the motorcycle .  

=======================================================================================================

1304 ===> my friend  s mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out  so when she brought home the convent  a horror movie  i couldn  t wait to watch it . given that it  s supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious  i can say that in some weird way  i like this movie .  br    br   yes  the acting is bad  and yes  it  s the cheapest movie i  ve ever seen  but it  s so damn funny   what  are you smoking ca  rack    i didn  t know this movie even was ever released . . . i figured it was too bad . . .  br    br   yeah  so . . . overall the movie is pretty bad  you gotta admit that much at least  but i promise you  you will get a good laugh out of it .  br    br   this movie kinda sucks but it  s good for a laugh . . . especially that guy that holds the  dagger of despair  . . the dagger of despaaaaaair   

=======================================================================================================

1305 ===> this is not a bad movie . it follows the new conventions of modern horror  that is the movie within a movie  the well known actress running for her life in the first scene . this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose  and manage to do something new  and interesting with it . it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack .  br    br   so this might be an example of what the genre has become . cut hits all the marks  and is actually scary in some parts . i liked it i gave it an eight .  

=======================================================================================================

1306 ===> this is surprisingly above average slasher  that  s enjoyable and well made  with some decent gore  . all the characters are decent  and the story is quite fun  plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well . i bought this at a pawn shop for a    and it was surprisingly worth it  and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget  plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy . the finale was really cool  as i loved how they defeated the killer  and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well  plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable  . it  s decently made and written  and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well  plus some of the death scenes were very impressive . this killer didn  t mess around  and i loved it  and slasher fans  like myself  should really enjoy this film  plus the opening was really wicked too  with them filming the movie  . this is a surprisingly above average slasher  that  s enjoyable  and well made  with some decent gore  and i say it  s well worth the watch  . the direction is good . kimble rendall does a good  job here with solid camera work  using a creepy setting  good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace . the acting is solid  . molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well  and i had troubles feeling sorry for her  after all she was supposed to be the heroine  she turned out better towards the end  but not by much  i  m surprised she decided to do this film  nonetheless she did an excellent job  . frank roberts is fantastic as the killer  he is menacing  creepy and had one hell of a mask  and this guy didn  t mess around  he was fantastic  . kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role . jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine . rest of the cast are fine . overall well worth the watch  .  out of   

=======================================================================================================

1307 ===> this film wasn  t programmed in italian cinemas  i have seen it at a manifestation called  fantafestival  . i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark  the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there  s no suspence in the film . music is completely out of the story and i don  t have words to describe the visual effects . if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting  but a few minutes later it becomes busy . the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review .  

=======================================================================================================

1308 ===> in fact  these young people were so distasteful that i couldn  t wait for all of  em to get slaughtered  and that includes clarissa  joanna canton  since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch .  br    br   but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background . it had nowhere to go but down .  br    br   even the prosthetics looked fake and the  blood  looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch  although later on it took on red day  glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing . i  m sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh  t since it  ll appeal to that bunch . it sure didn  t appeal to me . blah . . .  br    br   and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself . she still looks hot  though . i  m glad she takes care of herself since we don  t get to see too much of her nowadays .  br    br   however  it is a step up from dante tomaselli  s meandering horror       in that it has a somewhat coherent plot  so i  ll give it that much . that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch . i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end . it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film .  br    br   lion  s gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up .  br    br    out of    

=======================================================================================================

1309 ===> twelve years ago  production stopped on the slasher flick  hot blooded  since almost everyone on the set started dying . now  a couple of film students have decided to finish the film  despite the fact that there  s a rumor that the film is cursed . well  they  re about to find out that some curses are real .  br    br   when scream was released  every country seemed to want to cash in on its success  even australia . the concept  which today has been done to death  a slasher film within a slasher film  was at the time relatively cool and original . this movie was released right before urban legends final cut and scream   well not in the us but in australia  so it felt like the first movie with this concept . when urban legends  was released  most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn  t even good  the movie flopped disastrously . now  cut is not the best slasher flick ever  and nor does it try to be . it knows that it  s a rip  off  and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role . but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story  they  ve decided to rip  off some   s slasher flicks like  nightmare on elm street  as well and surprisingly enough  this actually works . the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer  and instead of trying to scare the audience to death  they  ve created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie . there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn  t able to fully ignore  the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie . spoiler ahead i mean  they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene  it makes no sense i tell you . end of spoilers . all in all  cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip  offs that never made it big . i  m surprised that this one never got a sequel  but i guess it simply came out too late .  br    br   suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares . cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it  s completely ludicrous .

1310 ===> when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure  type movies  the first thing i think of are    s slasher flicks . really bad slasher flicks . the formulaic type of film  where all a script needed was  parts blood and several parts nudity to get made .  br    br   flash forward to the late    s  early    s . the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of      s  scream  . like in the    s  these films were formulaic  masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as  hip  tongue  in  cheek parodies  of the original slasher flicks . of this recent blend of  hip parody  neo  slasher flicks  the only one worth seeing is the low  budget  direct  to  video  cut  .  br    br   like most of the other  new  slasher flicks   cut  relies on the production of a slasher flick  in this case a fictional     film  hot blooded   to make its commentary on the genre .  hot blooded  never finished production  because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film  s killer  scarman  a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark  pupil  less eyes . now    years later  a group of film students  whose professor was involved in the production  have decided to go into the vaults  tap the original surviving actress  and finish the film . but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot   scarman  returns and someone dies . to quote the tagline  will they finish the film before it finishes them   br    br   this all sounds really bad  and to a degree it is  really  is there such a thing as a good slasher flick   . there is no character development  the  new  director is revealed to be the daughter of  hot blooded   s original director  whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this would  ve been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot  yet it  s never mentioned again  and  like in all other slasher flicks  there are just too many bodies to care about . the actors aren  t great  even by direct  to  video standards  but most are having fun with their characters  and for those who aren  t  it  s inadvertent character acting  since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on  hot blooded    particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman .  cut   s climax has no big  who dunnit  unmasking of the killer like in the  scream  films . it doesn  t have the gimmick killings of the  urban legend  films . what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a  this way we can write a sequel if it sells well  ending . but that  s par for the course .  br    br   by any sensible viewing standards  this is a horrible movie that should be avoided  but this  quality  is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre  and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo  slasher flicks .  

=======================================================================================================

1311 ===> i just watched the convent for the second time . i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film  some gore  some style  bit of humour and suchlike . i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much . it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile . for the record i  m not even a huge fan of night of the demons  but there were some things i really dug about it . the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much . apart from the main girl  likeable performance from joanna canton   the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable  festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic  offensive jockhood . the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that  given the awful dialogue  it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film . the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes  though not scary their certainly kinda cool  and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore . towards the end  when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy . the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results  although sometimes the camera just moves too fast . all in all  this was a film where for me the shining good points just can  t make up for the things i hated . those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more  but for me it wasn  t a good time .  

=======================================================================================================

1312 ===>  . . . . . . this film is pretty awful  the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of  was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse .  br    br   the jungle music  juttering demons  and fluorescent uv style blood  teeth  eyes give it that  awful  look  and the script is dire . . . . . this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it . it  s also predictable but not in a good way . nothing this film does is in a good way . i watched it   minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are .  oh and the acting doesn  t let the film down  it  s also terrible   

=======================================================================================================

1313 ===> this is one of those little christmas movies for everyone . our scrooge is ben affleck  who decides money is not enough  so he rents the family who lives where he thought his family did . ok  this is a great little high school soap  pg     but the small sex references are comedy  so if your kid can  t handle them  they can  t live in the real world  either .  br    br   now  affleck is a hunk  and as usual walks through this fun  omg  remember when we did . . .  ensemble piece as if he were at the end stages of some neuroinfectious disease . but that  s ok  because even this old oracle keeps hoping that if ben  s that well proportioned all over  well  there  s hope for us ladies yet . luckily  the rest of the ensemble   catharine o  hara  james gandolfini  christina applegate  udo kier and josh zuckerman   fill in and keep this shadow  side  ozzie  and  harriet christmas alternately hilarious  comfortable and warm .  br    br   this movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn  and when you get back  everyone wants to back it up to show you what you missed .  br    br   this is a happy film  after all  and it leaves you feeling good about life  love  family  christmas and chanel . there really is something for everyone .  

=======================================================================================================

1314 ===> what  s with all the negative comments  after having seen this film for the first time tonight  i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person  s day . when i saw that drew  ben affleck  might end up spending the holidays alone  i wanted to cry . you  ll have to see the movie if you want to know why . also  even though i liked tom  james gandolfini  and alicia  christina applegate  after awhile  if you ask me  they were real snobs . however  this film did make me smile and feel good inside . before i wrap this up  i  d like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit . now  in conclusion  i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person  s day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasn  t seen it .  

=======================================================================================================

1315 ===> worst movie i have seen since gingerale afternoon . i suppose that this is a horror  comedy . i pretty much predicted every scene in this movie . the special  effects were not so special . i believe that i could come up with as good of effects from what i have lying around the house . i wish i could have something good to say about this movie  but i am afraid that i don  t . even coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey . i do  after a little thought  have one thing good to say about this movie  it ended .  

=======================================================================================================

1316 ===> rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent . there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film . what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings . actors of stature  robert duvall  robert downey  jr .  are deployed in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee  stained camera lens a writer  john grisham  who has never produced anything of merit  discovers new depths of under  motivated incoherence . the film has a cheap  lecherous feel about it  but barely at the level of commentary  its really part of the aesthetic . normally  i come on to the imdb to write balanced  generally appreciative comments . this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless  bilious rant . i won  t  but only because i no longer want to occupy my  mind  with this trash .  

=======================================================================================================

1317 ===> come on people . this movie is better than  . i can see this happening . . . wealthy people have done crazier things than this . and it was funny .  br    br   i watch a comedy to be entertained  escape from the pressures of the world for a short while  and not to have to take anything too seriously . this movie fully suits that purpose . i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles . i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring  likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home . it will remain on my list of  favorite . . . . . must watch for the holiday season  . if you just want to have a fun   minutes  watch this one .  

=======================================================================================================

1318 ===> you can survive surviving christmas . i thought the television version was a bit edited way down . i like ben afleck . he plays drew johnson  a family  less adult  who is willing to pay complete strangers . the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o  hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco  the daughter . drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn  t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars . bill macy who i best remember for playing maude  s husband arthur is hired to play duda  the grandfather . when the whole situation comes crashing down  the truth can be painful . the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation . drew  s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit . you can  t buy what you wish for  the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene .  

=======================================================================================================

1319 ===> i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great  so i went out and bought it . what a mistake  the acting is a shambles  the special effects  if you could call them that   look like something that wouldn  t be out of place at a school play . some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen  which unfortunately is all to often . as for a story  forget it . this is a warning  don  t waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen . if  for some reason  you like this film watch troll   you will probably enjoy that as well .  

=======================================================================================================

1320 ===> this movie is awful  i don  t even know where to begin  i  m speechless i can  t even describe how awful this is . the blood is flourescent first of all  and the acting is awful  the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day . this movie was rediculous  i don  t see how it could even get a vote of  its so bad . it looks like it was made by highschool students .  

=======================================================================================================

1321 ===> its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site . it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection . the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role . i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it . i rate it right up there with christmas vacation . the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well . the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act . the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks . plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can  t buy love with money .  

=======================================================================================================

1322 ===> i had some reservations about this movie  i figured it would be the usual bill of fare    a formula movie about christmas . being in the middle of a heat wave in late june  we decided to give it a shot anyway  maybe we would see some snow .  br    br   this movie turned out to be one laugh after another . ben affleck was believable in his character  but the real star of this one is james gandofini . he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great  dad  .  br    br   if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours  definitely check this one out .  

=======================================================================================================

1323 ===>   voodoo academy  features an  academy  like no other  one that houses only six male students in one bedroom . these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest  who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously . the sole administrator of this  academy  is a young and seductive headmistress  and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash  so to speak .  br    br   sexual overtones abound  and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies . these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the  academy   and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie . if you  re not interested in the male form   stay away   br    br   burdened by weak and awkward dialogue  this low  budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns . the mood is claustrophobic  with tediously long takes  a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes . these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue  intended as character and plot development . it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1324 ===> i have seen a lot of bad films . most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is . but this really takes badness to new extremes .  br    br   it is bland  the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it . there are no shocks  no horror  no suspense  just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish .  br    br   a blight on the crappy horror genre  avoid at all costs .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1325 ===> at first i didn  t think that ben affleck could really pull off a funny christmas movie   boy was i wrong  my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all . james gandolfini was funny   i really liked christina appelagate  and catherine o  hara was good too  the storyline is what really sold me   i mean   too put up with family   at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year   and probably don  t get along with anyway   you really do need as much alcohol as you  re system can stand to deal with christmas   so i thought that the premise was good there  buying the family with       dollars  was a little on the far fetched side   but it turned out to work pretty good for me   cause it was a riot all the way through  it shows the class struggle of the different families . it has lot  s of funny moments  including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy . all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too .  

=======================================================================================================

1326 ===> what would you expect from a film titled  surviving christmas  and presented as  festive fun   something like ghandi or english patient  there are lots of things i love about this film  it  s funny  it is very well cast and it is superbly written . i came to the film as a kaplan  elfort fan but was dubious when i read the plot  it sounded ridiculous . but the film doesn  t come across like that because affleck  as drew latham  plays his part perfectly  one minute a child  like adult  the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants . in fact we see latham grow up in this film  when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good  he sees that his own lot is not so bad .  br    br   this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen . comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama  it either works or it doesn  t and very few comedy writers get it correct every time . i particularly loved the drama scene  where the family take to reading parts written by latham . the pleasure is in the reaction of tom valco  james gandolfini  and the comments of brian valco  josh zuckerman  . it is the dilemma of the greedy tom valco who has to bite his tongue  wear silly hats or sing to the christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well .  br    br   the addition of daughter alicia  christina applegate  into the story brings a delightful romantic angle  and why not in a christmas film  of course its corny and contrived he  s rich and handsome  she  s beautiful and single  and so inevitably her and afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face . great  one thing i would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but i can  t really complain . i got what i wanted .  

=======================================================================================================

1327 ===> this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life   it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous   and i have never seen such bad acting in my life  the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys  especially drew fuller  . i don  t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie   i didn  t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves . i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn  i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch  i was very disappointed   the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion .  

=======================================================================================================

1328 ===> if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one . a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind . which actually becomes very boring after   minutes of touchy feely but no action . a few of the actors i  ve seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better . all the special effects are done by the great  rondo  whom performs all the magic whit his mind . a cult movie is written on the box . does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all     br    br   get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving .  

=======================================================================================================

1329 ===> i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt . ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role . gandolfini gives his typical a performance . the entire cast is funny  the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome . i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted . i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy  can identify with loneliness during the holidays and  or putting up with the relatives . the best part to this film  to me anyway  were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped . namely  the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree . go see it and have a good laugh   

=======================================================================================================

1330 ===> this movie was made in      but it still rings true today . very  very funny . it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it  builds  from there . anyone who has ever built a house  will find this movie very endearing . great cast . cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film . this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the    s . . . . clothing  architecture and family life . many references are made to the cost of things  and those comparisons to today  s costs are pretty amazing . i can  t imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely . i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it . a true classic .  

=======================================================================================================

1331 ===> what  s up with robert  pretentious  altman  was he saving on lighting  everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable . i mean  have you ever seen a lawyer  s office where everyone works by candlelight   br    br   don  t waste your time . in fact  don  t waste your time with anything altman makes it  s all a pretentious waste of film .  

=======================================================================================================

1332 ===> pros nothing  br    br   cons everything  br    br   plot summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies .  br    br   review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles . filmed on a budget of what looks to be about   bucks  tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame  forgetable actors whom couldn  t act to save their lives and gore that  s more gross than frightening . how does a movie like this even get made  simply put  avoid tzc like a sexually  transmitted disease .  br    br   my last  cents humorously enough  this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films . they  re brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this .  br    br   my rating  out of    if it were up to me  this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion   

=======================================================================================================

1333 ===> this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in      so i was definitely going to watch the repeat . i really sympathised with the main character of the film  because  this is true  i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had  dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa  eb  . this is a sad  sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder . jonny kennedy speaks like a kid  because of wasting vocal muscle  and never went through puberty  but he is   years old . most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition  and pealing off his bandages . jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour  he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin . he tells his story with the help of his mother  edna kennedy  his older brother and celebrity model  and jonny  s supporter  nell mcandrew . it won the baftas for best editing and best new director  factual   and it was nominated for best sound  factual  and the flaherty documentary award . it was number   on the    greatest tv treats     . a must see documentary   

=======================================================================================================

1334 ===> this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time . jonny kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration . not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there  but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love . watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart  wrenching . listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming . and seeing him smile was indescribable . i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant . please  if you ever have a chance to watch this film  consider yourself lucky to have met jonny kennedy .  

=======================================================================================================

1335 ===> and a few more  no  s on top of that . voodoo academy is  without a doubt  the least ambitious film of all time . what exactly is it trying to do  tell a story  obviously not as has been pointed out  most of it  s just barely  legal guys rubbing themselves . could it  then  be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism  well  maybe  if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact .  which is  to the delight of none  repeated about eighty thousand times .  well  it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us  not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his  work .   br    br   never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less . this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i  ve ever seen . it  s like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror  zombie  and gay movies  puts them in a grinder  then runs them through a coffee filter   only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans  it  s the kind that takes out everything vital  edgy  or in any way interesting . the result is   minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water   only without the ability to rehydrate you after the    day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort .  

=======================================================================================================

1336 ===> i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wanna kill my self . i don  t wanna live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny . what is wrong with these people . i  m not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat . i watched this film in disbelief . who would pay money to make this   this film is so bad that its painful . most bad films are funny because they are crap . the animal is just disgusting    watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self . we don  t need you . i want to raise money to get rob scheider off all movies . if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a nobel peace prize .  

=======================================================================================================

1337 ===> this man is nothing short of amazing . you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events  and cry along with his family in the end . he was so passionate about his cause  not just for himself  but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain . i watch this video every time i am having a bad or  down  day  and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life  just like jonny did  even with his unbearable pain . my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner  as i visited england  times during his life  and would have been able to say i  d met him . it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud  pain free  rest in peace  dear jonny . you deserve it   

=======================================================================================================

1338 ===> the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created . i cried the whole way through  from start to end . watching the show you are immediately captured by a man  s struggle to live without pain  to live a life we would take for granted . the first time i heard the title  i was almost scared to see the program  it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life . i truly felt for him . the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin . could you imagine doing that  even more so  even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity .  debra  jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration  he is the definition of a role model  what a true and undeniable hero he was   

=======================================================================================================

1339 ===> i hired this movie expecting a few laughs  hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken . this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it . . . aimed at an age group of       this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied . worth no more than  votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste  hours of their lives .  

=======================================================================================================

1340 ===> guy is a loser . can  t get girls  needs to build up  is picked on by stronger more successful guys  etc . seen it  saw it  moved on . i  d have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life . and get out of the adam sandler plots . there are two funny parts in the whole movie . i couldn  t even finish the last  minutes . i was getting bored .  the animal  is an alright film . i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot . but this was trying too hard to impress . the jokes are very old . so  trust me . this is not a film that most people could really get into . but some did  so i  ll be nice .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

1341 ===> i have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as jonny kennedy . i never got the chance to meet him but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him . i hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition . this man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not . i believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools . i also agree with other comments  what have i got to moan about  he took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour . god bless . i couldn  t watch the part that showed his dressings being changed . i have enough trouble with my son  s .

1342 ===> was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions  so i turned to my twin sister and said   hey this looks like fun    truly i love documentaries  so we started watching it . at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man  but then it was explained that due to his condition  he never went through puberty  thus the high voice and smaller body . he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause . he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality . . . i cried  watched some more  laughed  got up to get another kleenex  then cried some more . once jonni kennedy  s  time was up  he flew to heaven to be with the angels . he was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free . i highly recommend this . if you do not fall in love with this guy  you have no heart .

1343 ===> i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow  which i enjoyed . however  this dud seemed to last forever . it  s one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg    while not being kid appropriate . the jokes aren  t just low  brow or ft jokes  they  re crude  lewd  and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency . many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg    rating . . . too bad . . . it might have made a bigger splash as an r  rated film if the funny was left in .  overstatement  probably .  i do not recommend this movie . it is a full  on waste of time . . . and i  m a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot . at   minutes in  the movie felt like it should be winding down . . . and boy were we ready for it to . the ending is quaint but doesn  t salvage the rest of this quagmire  tourist trap of a rental .    star  glad i saw it as a freebie . . . would have been sickened to pay hard  earned greenbacks for this tripe   

=======================================================================================================

1344 ===> nothing in this movie is funny . i thought the premise  giving a human the libido of a randy ram  was interesting and should provide for some laughs . wrong  there is simply nothing funny about the movie . for example  the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer  s yard is not funny  it borders on obscenity . they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level  and it just aint funny .  br    br   we all know that dogs will eat anything  anywhere  anytime . the main character doing this with everything  everywhere  everytime is also not funny . it becomes a cliche .  br    br   rob schneider is  i guess  acceptable in the role . by this  i mean that he  s not a bad actor  but with rotten material it  s difficult to comment on quality . however  coleen haskell  the other half of the human  romantic leads  does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too    seems embarrassed by the whole thing  as well she should be . she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum  detached from all the other actors in the movie .  br    br   see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless  dull  repetitive material .

1345 ===> as with all of angelopoulos  films   the suspended step of the stork  implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer  a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work . dialogues are sparing  with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters  inner conflicts  doubts  or feelings . the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses  and instead forces them to explore and study the characters  identities for themselves . as a result  the acting is understated and implicit  as opposed to overt and explicit .  br    br   the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation  where the viewer is asked to become a participant  to participate as an actor  by probing his or her own psyche . as in a novel  where the drama rests entirely on the author  s writing to provide a template where the reader  s imagination and  or past experience flourish  angelopoulos  drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots  the long takes  the leisurely pacing  the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark  inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective . angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity  reverting to the non  verbal language of gestures  gazes  sounds  and music  when he believes that words can only take us so far .  br    br   the music  by angelopoulos  long time collaborator  eleni karaindrou  provides more than just a discreet background  but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story . a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle  subdued colors  recorded in a drab winter light . angelopoulos presents us with an  other greece   one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures  with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas  drowned in an eternal sunshine . here  the skies are covered and gray  the air is cold and misty  and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled  dirty snow of the village streets . angelopoulos  genius through arvanitis  camera is on display throughout the film .  br    br    the suspended step of the stork  is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio  political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century . it is deeply concerned with the meaning of  borders   and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations . in the  waiting room  facing the albanian border  the refugees  political or other  outcast by the rest of humanity  wait . they may be stuck against a political border  but unfortunately they still carry with them  and hang on  deeper ancestral borders those of the languages  of the customs  and of the races . although angelopoulos  political views are well known  the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees  plights . in the process  angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical  cultural  political  and personal  borders .   br    br   angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece  and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions . in this film  he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures  drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus  travel . alexander is a telemachus  in search of a story about an aging greek politician  odysseus who disappeared  never to be heard of again . this political man  a brilliant orator  unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence  his wife  and his brilliant career  to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low . he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world . of course  the  politician  is not alexander  s father  but the  politician  stands before alexander like a father figure  odysseus . as with homer  s telemachus  alexander grows as a person during his odyssey .  br    br   of course  it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer  s odyssey in a contemporary context . angelopoulos draws on odysseus  s travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film . in angelopoulos  ending   odysseus  is more like the dante  s odysseus he does not leave for ithaca but goes on   carrying a suitcase .  and alexander  telemachus is  suspended  between returning to his home and his career  or embarking on a voyage to  somewhere else .  he states as much  in a voice  over at the beginning of the film  paraphrasing few lines from dante  s  inferno    and don  t forget that the time for a voyage has come again . the wind blows your eyes far away .   br    br   finally  although angelopoulos is not a religious person  there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow  suited linesmen  who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications  and also the christ  like figure of the  politician .  in the final scene  these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography  s influence in angelopoulos  work . they appear like  stylites   religious figures found in the orthodox tradition  solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars  in a form of asceticism .  br    br   the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni . angelopoulos does not give us any clues  and the wife  s statement   it  s not him   is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough . the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician  but that he could be the politician . but the film still ends on an optimistic note . whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river  and thus communications across the border are still not possible  and it remains impenetrable  we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border  and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary . on this account  angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow  some of the borders will eventually crumble .

1346 ===> one of cary grant  s most enduring comedies is mr . blandings builds his dream house . although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today . still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham .  br    br   what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years . returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans . the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand . around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft  ellender  wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business .  br    br   i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties . like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester . their place wasn  t quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms  still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did .  br    br   of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up  threatening to send cary to the cleaners . cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel  usually too late . truth be told he  s kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it .  br    br   myrna loy  s role is simply an extension of nora charles . if you can imagine the charles  s moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does  the film would still work just fine .  br    br   mr . blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal . and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over   years .  

=======================================================================================================

1347 ===> this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care .    of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever  i laughed so much my ribs began to ache . the bit where the old men when to capture robert duvall was ludicrous . on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character . this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes . seeing as this was based on a  manuscript  by john grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as  the firm  or  the rainmaker  .  

=======================================================================================================

1348 ===> i saw an interview with rob schneider  who plays the lead character  marvin mange  in this film .  he said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you  d be laughing at this movie . obviously that must be the secret . i had the volume turned up . i was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster  and completely unfunny  a major disappointment after schneider  s hilarious performance in  deuce bigalow  male gigolo .   br    br   the story is stupid mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named dr . wilder  michael caton   and as a result starts to lose control of his  animal instincts .  this makes him a  supercop .  he can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses . of course  he also has a nasty habit of eating people  s cows and trying to seduce their goats  but surely that  s a small price to pay  it just didn  t do anything for me .  br    br   the cast left much to be desired . is there a more irritating actor in all of hollywood than john mcginley  here  he plays sgt . sisk  mange  s commander on the police force  as a repugnantly cartoonish character  much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular tv series  scrubs .   i was anxious to get a look at colleen haskell  s first  serious  acting job  can anything in this movie be called  serious    she  of course  gained her fame as a contestant on the first  survivor  and she proves here what we knew from that she  s cute as a button . what she doesn  t prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress . and what  s with ed asner as police chief wilson . i mean  how old is this guy now  he  s the size of some of the cows mange tried to eat  and he seemed out of breath the whole way through . i  m surprised he made it through the filming . there  s a brief cameo at the end by adam sandler  who also served as executive producer of this .   br    br   anyway  i chuckled twice mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car  and the scene schneider has with haskell and the orangutan  the orangutan has more acting talent  so  for two chuckles      .  

=======================================================================================================

1349 ===> enjoyed this     film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially  william powell   dr . lawrence bradford    mister roberts   who played the role as a doctor and detective . dr . bradford was once married to jean arthur   paula bradford    shane   and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time . paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important . jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of     comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe  especially with a jockey on a california race track . robert armstrong   nick martel   king kong  gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with james gleason  a detective who need the help of dr . bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery . if you see this film  just remember it was produced and directed in     and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days   

=======================================================================================================

1350 ===>   the ex  mrs . bradford         starring thin man series star william powell  this film was released the same year as the second thin man film   after the thin man   comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man films  but it nonetheless misses . still  it is a wonderfully fun  highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein .  br    br   is myrna loy missed  of course  let  s not lie . however  i  d be hard  pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur . and the chemistry between arthur and co  star william powell is real and it  s fun  romantic and involving .  br    br   the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wyne  s production company partner  james edward grant   the angel  the bad man   is close to being up there with a thin man effort  but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle .  br    br   while it  s not in the stratosphere of  the thin man  movies  what else is     the ex  mrs . bradford  is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery  comedy  who  done  its  of the    s    s .  

=======================================================================================================

1351 ===> i didn  t really like this movie that much at all . it wasn  t really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid . rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this  it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in . i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that  s about it . the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and i  m not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found . all in all it was a couple notches below an average movie   br    br   final query  br    br   theaters so glad i didn  t squander too much money on this .  br    br   dvd purchase ummm  let me think . . . . no   br    br   rental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not .  

=======================================================================================================

1352 ===> marvin  rob schneider  does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream . but his luck changes when he has a car crush  a very bad one  and is found by a doctor . the doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him . after this moment  he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be . by the time  he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side . in the mean time  he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised . i am not a big fun of rob schneider . in fact  this is the his first film i have seen . however  i can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser .  see his part in ally mcbeal  quite funny actually  . there are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat . in such movies  the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent . i am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously . but very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office . the animal is not the worst film i have seen to date but fails to get more than  .  

=======================================================================================================

1353 ===> i  ve seen the thin man series   powell and loy are definitely great  but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur  s chemistry in this flick . jean arthur shines when she looks at powell . there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them . this film may not have the wit of the thin man series  but undeniably makes up for it in charm . while i watched it  i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off  screen affair with arthur . my friends thought the same . this is one film where i wish i could step back in time  to schmooze and lock lips with powell   there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks  powell  s character  lawrence bradford  is probably the closest thing to the  perfect man .  okay  this is sounding way too gushy  but i can  t help myself .  

=======================================================================================================

1354 ===> rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia  for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man . they succeeded to some degree .  br    br   a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles  bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role . so by this time he was pretty well set in the role . doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles  but the basic blas nick is still there . one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress  doctor bradford works for a living as a physician . that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film .  br    br   he  s got two murders to solve . a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason . the trainer suspects something afoot  but he  s bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet . this is after he comes to bill powell for help .  br    br   myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was . arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did . but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry .  br    br   the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levene  nat pendleton role . all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powell  s butler was essaying that part .  br    br   if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films .  

=======================================================================================================

1355 ===> i believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war  avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles . zvezda barely does the first . zvezda being a russian war film  i was expecting patriotism  sentimentality  beautiful poetic pictures  a lush score  slavic cheekbones and cruel germans . what i didn  t need was the naive love non  affair  the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references  stalinism  nazism  holocaust  only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about  liberating poland  . a missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently .  

=======================================================================================================

1356 ===> for domestic audiences i can see how they would applaud this movie . for outsiders  with no vested interests  it did not make much sense . the germans were portrayed as incompetents and the russians as heroes . the supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction . how a young woman could  love  the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense . how she could  as mentioned at the end of the movie  never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me . i mentioned the germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh . several hundred german troops advanced  pushing the russians into the marsh . so the russians hid and the germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening . i suppose they did not want to get their boots wet  but i am sure an officer would have ordered   or   men into the water to search the marsh . but that would have ended the story . also  the germans entered the barn where the russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof . at the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in .  br    br   i did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end . i wonder why  you knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart  tugging in that .  

=======================================================================================================

1357 ===> i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region  dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it . a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan .  br    br   the story is pretty straight forward  and has been mentioned already so i won  t go into it again . needless to say it  s the fight scenes that many buy the movie for  and they do not disappoint . only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed . bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time  all kicks and punches come with the all important  type writer  clicks and air  whooshes   which is a cool effect though quite amusing   br    br   i give this movie a b . good but not great . in a way i feel it could have been that bit better . golden swallow  by the same director a decade earlier  had as good a story and better action .  

=======================================================================================================

1358 ===> the five deadly venoms is easily the most memorable k . f . flick from the shaw brothers  stable  exc . maybe master killer  . it has the artists who came to be known as simply  the venoms   some of the best fight choreography ever  and  surprisingly for a kung fu movie  a great plot  one of my all  time favorites     

=======================================================================================================

1359 ===> manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa  parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjs  br    br   this movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe  br    br   the british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid  br    br   the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life  the masks of amitabh haha and more  br    br   direction by manmohan desai is bad music is okay  br    br   amitabh does his part with style  nothing different from coolie  laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual  nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual  

=======================================================================================================

1360 ===> bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachan  s mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated . manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag  parvarish  amar akbar anthony  naseeb  desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed . my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part   maybe mr desai ran out of ideas  after all he had been using that formula for years and years .  . first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa  for instance the police inspector who brings up amar  the muslim who brings up akbar  nirupa roy and a few more .  . in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight  in mard she loses her voice  . in aaa there is the famous song  shirdi wale sai baba  well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali . having seen aaa for over     times i noticed that straight away .  br    br   my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous  true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far . my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing . i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didn  t like it one bit . it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child .  

=======================================================================================================

1361 ===> i loved this film . i first saw it when i was    which was only four years ago  and i enjoyed it so much  i brought my own copy the next day . the comedy is well played by all involved . i always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where mr . tsanders explains why he found water at  ft in one area and    feet in another area . also look for jason robards father who plays mr . retch . talent ran in that family .  

=======================================================================================================

1362 ===> i recall seeing this movie as a kid . i don  t recall where i saw it . i must have been around   years old . i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again . it came on the kung fu channel once  but i missed it . i was really bummed . it is the best special  effects kung fu movie that i  ve seen to date  i highly recommend it  and now that i  ve discovered where to get it  i can enjoy it once more and for years to come . i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly .  

=======================================================================================================

1363 ===> this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  br    br   i have to disagree with another commenter  who said the special effects were okay . i found them pretty bad it just wasn  t realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story .  br    br   maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story . the archaeologists are looking for  the set  . they do not bother to tell what set  or what is so special about it . that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california  while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt .  br    br   if you  re shooting a movie that takes place in the desert  take the effort to actually go to the desert . the beginning  the ancient ceremony  looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert .  br    br   the action  level was constant throughout the movie  no ups and downs  no climax . it made the movie look short  and that  s certainly a pro for this particular movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1364 ===> i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently  and the sci  fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find . as such  i  m sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion . the acting was uncharacteristically sub  par  as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci  fi usually has in store for us . there are a few cameos made by people you  d most likely recognize  although you may not know their names by heart . the cgi special effects are minimal  and as such  one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci  fi feature is lacking . sure  there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer  or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he  s known for a couple of days  but overall  it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter  and i consider that a major disappointment .  br    br   if i was rating it on a   star scale made specifically to judge made  for tv movies  i  d probably give it a   maybe even a  . a real shame that i may have to wait  till the next sci  fi original movie to get a good laugh  and i really hope that this movie isn  t part of some overall quality increase in sci  fi original movies .  

=======================================================================================================

1365 ===> when i was very young  on a local tv station  they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on saturdays . i saw lots of kung fu movies on weekends . i remember lots of them . i saw great flicks like crippled masters  blind fist of bruce  kung fu zombie  shaolin drunken monk  rage of the master  tattoe dragon  and . . . five deadly venoms . i remember the day clearly . me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king . we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday . we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch  turned on the set and flicked it onto   . the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it . then under that was the title of the film . it said five deadly venoms . then the movie began . i bit into my burger amused with the pre  credit sequence . i loved this movie the minute it came on . my favorite character was the toad venom . the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn  t what lured me . . . it was the fighting . the fights were so . . . amazing . i moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the  hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended .  

=======================================================================================================

1366 ===> this movie is really good . the plot  which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess  what will happen next . such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle . fighting scenes are very good . there  s a lot of different combat styles  although one of styles was a bit unreal for me  but it  s only my opinion  to watch and it  s fascinating show . the only thing which may be irritating is actors look . a bit too effeminate  at least for me  . hong kong was always good at kung  fu movies especially in the    s and    s  so  five venoms   or other its versions  is great choice .

1367 ===> tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the    s during the filming of demille  s first version of the   commandments and which is reawakened when demille  s sets are unearthed in the desert .  br    br   one of the worst films i  ve seen in a long time .  br    br   the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film  if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness . if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons . you will laugh long and hard at this film  probably more than many other hollywood  comedies  .

1368 ===> watching the first   minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes . it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy . the setup was promising  in the      s cecil b . demille makes his opus of the ten commandments . it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil  don  t they always   . aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down . hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time . then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site  the movie  s first mistake  but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci  fi channel movie  . the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it  s a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect . then the body counts starts . this is were the movie went south for me . the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction . once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do  they make the usual stop to the  guy who knows the truth but never told anyone  . after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site  no  they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk . really i  m not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i  d put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem . after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way  by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it  s standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades . for a sci  fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out  which isn  t saying much at all . what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it .  

=======================================================================================================

1369 ===> i really like this movie . i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it . i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie .  br    br   the story is very interesting . it introduces us to  characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly . each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other . the dying master sends the  th venom  his last student  to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed .  br    br   how will the last pupil find the other venoms  how will he know which of them is bad  the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great .  br    br   we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination . it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other .  br    br   if you want to see if you like kung fu movies  this is a good movie to start with . it doesn  t get any better than this .  

=======================================================================================================

1370 ===> if you love kung  fu films and you haven  t seen this movie  you are cheating yourself . this movie is one of the only kung  fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film . normally  it takes a die  hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films  but this one has it all  the story is well told  and complete . the fight scenes are great  and tend to end before you  re completely bored with them  unlike crouching tiger  . throw in a little mystery and torture and you  ve got yourself one heck of a movie . see this one at all costs . heck  my wife even enjoyed it .  br    br   wu du it   br    br    out of    br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1371 ===> while the idea is more original than most sci  fi movies  the execution is  as usual lacking . while the practical mummy effects are not bad  and the  gun nut  character is over the top giggle inducing  the only real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen . i suspect that was the idea all along . they do the best they can with what they have but the  must see  moments for me were in the first   minutes or so when morena  s character sported some tomb raider style shorts . not high brow cinema i know but you can  t deny true beauty when you see it    and adam baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate . if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you . if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere .  

=======================================================================================================

1372 ===> reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget  tons of popular faces  a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves . the end result is a disaster . alice tremblay  s supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it  s audience  i didn  t hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation   going through it  s page  thin story line and one  dimensional characters without a single spark  not a sign of the magic it wished it had . the   minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn  t seem that great an idea on the set  let alone on paper .  l  odysse d  alice tremblay  is a collage of comic sketches  linked together with a  very  thin layer of good ideas . avoid or boredom will haunt you .  

=======================================================================================================

1373 ===> a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan . he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good . the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake  centipede  scorpion  lizard  toad  while the last student was taught a little in each style . all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money  and soon everyone is battling to get the money .  br    br   classic martial arts film has title that even many non  fans know . i  ve spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head . its a very good movie  though i  m not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio  one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example  . this isn  t to sell the film short  its not  since the film is structured like a mystery  our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is . we  re given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is . the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film  other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money  there is really no action for about   or   minutes . its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention .  the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i  ve ever seen where there are no women . i don  t think one has a speaking role and i  m pretty sure that none appear in the background . its indicative of nothing  its just something that struck me .  this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles  but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch .  br    br   around  out of   .

1374 ===> one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema  or  indeed  most anything done outside these holier  than  thou united states  are the permutations that crop up . in post  world war two japanese manga  comics   for instance  are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects  many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion . the same thing happens in genre film  making  as well though  again  i  m referring to movies made outside the u .  .  where we  re just too  sophisticated  in our close  mindedness to appreciate anything that isn  t about or by us  . would an american company  for instance  back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler  el santo  or a werewolf  paul naschy  or a real  life martial artist  bruce lee  . . .  as for television forget it . while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine  i  ve always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was  how to put it kindly  a bit lacking . to this very day  there hasn  t been a pay  per  view channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia .  there are lots of soft  core porn masquerading as entertainment shows  but the so  called action channel  for instance  has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries .  before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc  there was  of all things  at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery the  deadly venoms . in its own right as fascinating as any other genre  based whodunit  western  cop show  etc .   this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work . it  s now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent  thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve . if you  re a martial arts movie fan  rejoice one of the greatest movie genres of all time  specifically  the martial arts movies of the     s and early     s  are getting a long  overdue second life  and greatly appreciated second look  on dvd .  

=======================================================================================================

1375 ===> this movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet . it made the rm  sons of provo look like well done films  it was supposed to be funny from what i was told . the best part was the best actor in the movie  travis eberhard  if he wasn  t in the movie it probably wouldn  t have been made  he ruled   br    br     . it wasn  t funny  . it was beat  . it had thurl big t bailey  who  s character made no sense  . it was made in provo  . it didn  t make fun of brokeback  . it had larry h . miller in it  . it was the  st movie clint howard wasn  t funny in  . gary coleman chose the perfect movie  a comeback  . they should have cast at surreal life auditions  . it was made by halestorm entertainment    

=======================================================================================================

1376 ===> well  i suppose the good news concerning william winckler  s     opus   the double  d avenger   is that it manages to unite three of russ meyer  s mammarian marvels   kitten natividad  haji and raven de la croix   in one picture .  i can only assume that lorna maitland  tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thing . . . or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance   the bad news  though  and there  s plenty of it   is that this film   if it can even be called that  having been shot straight to video   is a complete misfire  a total abortion  an out  and  out atrocity  an absolute abomination  and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen . look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made  the plot here  such as it is  deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer  oy   and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in l . a . too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely  you should pardon the expression  flat  that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all  other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday   and that some shaving cream and a papier  mache boulder are the sum total of the special fx . the meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth  saggy in the chest  to put it kindly  although sheri dawn thomas  as bikini girl ooga boobies     does manage to  uh  stand out nicely . so why have i given this juvenile  unfunny  failed embarrassment of a movie  stars instead of   to be succinct joe bob briggs . his voice  over commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious  especially when he pulls out around    synonyms for the word  breast  from the       on his web site  s  canonical hooters list .  the man is a national treasure  and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status

1377 ===>   in the world of old  school kung fu movies  where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen  it took a lot for a film to stand out   and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years . what is arguably chang cheh  s finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry  from the themes of loyalty  brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo  who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang  during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late      s  to more modern movies like a man called hero  which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film . the influence has also carried into other areas as well  from music such as the wu  tang clan  tv commercials for sprite and video games such as  mortal kombat .  so what makes this movie so special  the plot   on the surface   is pretty simple . it deals with members of a rogue group known as the  poison clan  who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu . all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities  denoted by their animal styles  or  venoms   the lizard can climb walls  the scorpion has a deadly strike  etc .  . the twist is that since the clan always wears masks  not all of them known who the others are . thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller . we  re not talking the usual suspects here  but it  s far above many other kung fu movies of the time . supposedly  golden harvest was not too happy with chang  s script   like most of his movies  they felt it was too dark and violent   and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it . thankfully  chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script  which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time  if not ever  completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences .  br    br   but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves . chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast   not only did he gain talented martial artists  whose moves  competed without the aid of wires or other special effects  put most modern martial artists to shame  but great actors as well . the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies . getting back to matters at hand  in most old  school movies  the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts  but here the actors actually create characters . it seems that everyone has a favorite venom  mine is philip kwok   best known to many as mad dog from hard  boiled   as lizard  and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre . even if you  re normally not a fan of old  school movies  you need to check the five deadly venoms out  if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from .   

=======================================================================================================

1378 ===> there  s no romance or other side plot to this movie  it  s action and intrigue all the way  making it a real man  s kung  fu movie .  br    br   an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who  s styles represents five venomous animals centipede  snake  scorpion  lizard and the toad . despite the word  venom  in the title  none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents . yan tieh told by his teacher that he  s no match for the five former pupil  must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four . how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story  with good kung  fu action spread out throughout the story .  br    br   recognized as a cult classic  this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung  fu action movies . it  s known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story .  br    br   it  s no artistic masterpiece  with the usual bad dubbing  and corny acting  but the movie is one of the best of its kind  because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung  fu action movie of its time  and gives an extra concentrated dose of them .  br    br   one movie you must watch if you are a kung  fu movie fan .  

=======================================================================================================

1379 ===> i went to see this film with fairly low expectations  figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff . sadly  it wasn  t even that . i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out . i went with my two kids  ages   and    and even they kept asking   how much longer   after lasting until the end  i just kept wondering who would approve this script . even the reliable fred willard couldn  t save the trite dialogue  the state jokes  and the banal plot . i  d suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie  i use the term loosely  should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class . at the least  there are many books on directing  screen writing  and producing movies that would teach them something about structure  plot  dialogue and pacing .  

=======================================================================================================

1380 ===> the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget  halestorm entertainment  has had to work with . all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash . not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful  but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best . the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc . the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing . i think just because i couldn  t believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the  film  .  

=======================================================================================================

1381 ===> be careful with this one . once you get yer mitts on it  it  ll change the way you look at kung  fu flicks . you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung  fu films now  you will be wanting character depth and development  you will be craving mystery and unpredictability  you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops . sadly  you won  t find all of these aspects together in one kung  fu movie  except for five deadly venoms   br    br   easily the best kung  fu movie of all  time  venoms blends a rich plot  full of twists and turns  with colourful  and developed  characters  along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the   s . the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which  and who specializes in what venom . one is the centipede  two is the snake  three is the scorpion  four is the lizard  and five is the toad . each character has different traits  characteristics  strengths  and weaknesses . therein lies the hook  we learn along with the student character  finding out who these different men turn out to be . we are in his shoes  so to speak   and we have to pick who we trust  and who we don  t  just like he does . we learn along with him .  br    br   not only is the plot  the characters  and the camerawork great  it  s also fun to watch  which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it  s kind . it  s worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that  s going on . venoms is a lesson on what kung  fu can really do . . . just don  t expect many other kung  fu films to live up to it  s gauntlet .  

=======================================================================================================

1382 ===> after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly   years  i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism  nor any of its eye  popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth . the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his  unfinished  pupil out to find the  past members of his poison clan  so they do not seek out a fortune which the master  s friend keeps hidden . afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training  he instructs him to befriend one of the five  venoms  so as to defeat the other four .  br    br   i can  t say enough about the choreography or the camera work . a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made . a classic    

=======================================================================================================

1383 ===> first of all  let me say the i am lds or rather  i am a mormon . so when i watched this film  i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt . i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch . and this one was no exception . it does have its redeeming moments . but they are few and far between .  br    br   one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though halestorm was ashamed of our church  in the lds church  congregations are called  wards  and the basketball court is in the  cultural hall  . never once are either of these two names mentioned . the church is never referred to by name and  the standards  is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes .  br    br   it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds wannabes  this film had so much potential  it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer  but also what we believe . instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired . if i were not already lds  i  d be left thinking mormons are stupid  idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs .  br    br   it is not a film i will recommend to my nonlds friends .  br    br   sorry halestorm . you can do better than this   

=======================================================================================================

1384 ===> i  ve never been a huge fan of mormon films . being a mormon  i  ve always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos . i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air  the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non  mormon friends .  br    br   boy  was i wrong .  br    br   i figured  since this had b  list talent like clint howard  gary coleman  andrew wilson  and fred willard  one of my favorites   this would have to be at least a little funny . and besides  church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such . but i must say  throughout the entire movie  it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing . every joke fell flat  and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored . the dialogue was bland  and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen . every single character but wilson  s was less than one  dimensional . it  s hard to believe that after nine re  writes the film was still as mind  numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed . i can  t put into words the rage i felt sitting through this . my friends and i were extras in the final game scene  so we went to the premiere in washington city  ut . kurt hale  the director  was there  and i must say  i avoided all contact with him after the show . he waited at the door  seemingly ready for feedback . i couldn  t bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life  but it left a nasty  painful scar that i will never forget .  br    br   here are a few specific problems i had there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player  but these two characters came out of nowhere  and were impossible to care about  so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame  uninteresting characters . there were many subplots that popped up every now and then  each promising the audience the chance for laughs  but each one came and went in a puff of smoke  ending before you could even start caring . this was pretty much how the whole movie felt .  br    br   this film was a major letdown  and i feel bad for everyone who  s expecting the first real funny mormon movie . true  the jokes in this one aren  t too exclusive to mormons . then again  it  s hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears .  br    br   please  do not see this movie . keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious . spare yourself the disappointment i went through  

=======================================================================================================

1385 ===> most   s  and   s  kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well  planned fight sequences  but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes   like porno films  really .  br    br   but this one does several things well . most overtly  there is the direction and choreography  which confines each combatant to a  style    it  s really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater  but the effect works .  br    br   second  there is the language of the camera  which uses some impressive techniques  even by today  s measure   changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion  and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future .  br    br   least overt  but most powerful and unexpected  is the construction . the winner of this contest is determined by who  unfolds  the story . the master  the writer  sets up a game where the lead character doesn  t know who he  s seeking  which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in . one by one  he figures out who is who  at the same rate we find out who is who . it all follows a tragedy  noir arc . the ending tends toward irony  a la  the sting  . much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre .  br    br   the  five venoms  idea is the template for tarantino  s  deadly viper assassins  from the  kill bill  volumes .  

=======================================================================================================

1386 ===> for all the hoopla  respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historians  it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas action and fight scenes . but i must say that the plot is probably the best and most original i  ve ever seen in a martial arts film . five deadly venoms without a doubt is a must see  not only that  a movie you can watch again and again but i also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better . it somehow leaves you wanting something  you want more . the producer chang cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn  t follow through with giving us more of the action we want . the fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer  centipede  snake  scorpion  lizard  toad  and they are shown  but battles are noticeably short . the toad and snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much  much more  in fact the toad is killed off by the middle of the movie . interestingly enough with this movie  the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot  this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome . this movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe . sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel . to start off the movie and to introduce the poison clan producer chang cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon . the ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more . still though this movie is one of shaw brothers best and is quite enjoyable . my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this the styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail  sad thing is  the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn  t expand on it . i am left wondering what could have been with this movie  still one of the best though .  out of   on the scale .  

=======================================================================================================

1387 ===> every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people . if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie  how great will be my joy .  br    br   where to begin my discussion of pain . for starters  there was a musical montage every five minutes . there was no character development . every character was a stereotype . we had swearing guy  fat guy who eats donuts  goofy foreign guy  etc . the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot . the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation . have the directors  producers  etc . ever even seen a movie before  halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry . the concept for this movie sounded so funny . how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors . but trust me when i say this  things went wrong  very wrong .  

=======================================================================================================

1388 ===> i was not expecting much going in to this  but still came away disappointed . this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen . i thought it was supposed to be a comedy  but i only snickered at  or  jokes . is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over  what was up with the janitor in heaven scene  fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations  but this did not work . they must have spent all the budget on getting  known  actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget . it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark . does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket  as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket  i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies  but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1389 ===> the five deadly venoms is a great kung  fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery . there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung  fu flick great choreography  awful dubbing  different  styles  of fighting  and a wide range of greatly exaggerated  often cheesey human emotions . however the plot certainly is better than average . it  s interesting and holds your attention throughout the non  fight scenes . occasionally it  s even able to fire up the audience  such as when x character receives horrible injustice .  br    br   another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie  s morals and themes . just about everyone gets what  s coming to them . the cowardly  greedy  and corrupt lose out . the bad guys  consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing . the good guys use teamwork  planning  and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top .  br    br   poison clan rocks   

=======================================================================================================

1390 ===> i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv .  br    br   the one scene that always stands out  for me that is  is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman  where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says  did you get that  that  s yellow  blue  green and white

1391 ===> kitten natividad  of russ meyer film fame  plays chastity knott  a woman who has found she has breast cancer  so she goes to south america to get some special fruit  crockazilla   that is supposed to have healing powers . after going down on some of this fruit  which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks  chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super  hero  specifically  the double d avenger . note that she  s also wearing a pair of panties as a mask . in writing  that all sounds pretty good . in execution  well  it leaves more than a little to be desired . it seems that chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she  s taking away their business so some of the strippers  including haji  also of russ meyer film fame  go after her to ruin her . of course  chastity fights back in the guise of the double d avenger . watch her do a  wonder woman  type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force . bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow . with the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted    s  live action  kid  s show with adult content  although while this is unrated it could probably get away with pg    at the worst . and it  s probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered . this makes doris wishman  s chesty morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison . special appearance by forest j . ackerman but so what . very stupid  and i  m never buying another film with joe bob briggs on the cover .  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

1392 ===> first  let  s all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor  barely even decent  sometimes just plain lousy . however  in this piece of    called snakeeater  the film industry as a whole sank .  br    br   first  let  s start with the plot . a vietnam vet named jack kelly  aka soldier  who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some  which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through  guys  feet and pins them to the floor   gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped . therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister . had some potential  but still pretty thin to begin with .  br    br   now  the acting . being an actor myself  i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art      lamas is  well  himself . the jackasses playing the clampets  deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so  called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere  especially talented ones who never get their big break   br    br   finally  the action . the gunfighting is so  so at best  and the fist  fighting is deplorable . i  ve seen more real  looking fights at the renaissance festival  and those were pretty fake  looking    br    br   readers  listen to me avoid this piece of caca at all costs  if it were the only film in existence  you still would want to avoid it  for the sake of your brain  cell count  do not watch this thing   

=======================================================================================================

1393 ===> the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first . the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off . however  i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem . i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy   sarah  s character is a true sociopath  very comparable to sedaris  jerri blank .  br    br   the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast . her sister  s character is good funny at times  but ultimately meant not to steal sarah  s show . however  the rest of the cast is extremely sub  par in comparison .  br    br   i  m glad  though  that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor .  

=======================================================================================================

1394 ===> i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes . you people are so damn sensitive it is inane  so quick to point out the  racism  of the show and the jokes  yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist  pig  headed crap like  well  duh  some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women .  so disgusting . abortion jokes are great because  really  who takes abortion seriously anyways  at least i  m not aboreson . i hear that reba mcentire and sarah silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together . talk about a movie of the year   

=======================================================================================================

1395 ===> lorenzo lamas stars as jack solider kelly an ex  vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks . atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed  and yet has  minutes of screen time  and even those aren  t any good . overall a terrible movie  but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few  unintentional  laughs . followed by an improved sequel .  

=======================================================================================================

1396 ===> this is a really bad film  with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though  . all the characters are just annoying  except lamas   and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for   plus the action is very boring . the film gives us  villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring  laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up   plus it looks very cheap and amateurish  . lorenzo lamas has a lot of charisma but he can  t save this piece of crap  and believe it or not the opening was really cool  as was the ending  however the middle is incredibly boring  and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button   plus the dialog is especially laughable  . there is a cool bar scene that i really liked  but once lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart  plus the scene where the villains torture jennifer  s family  and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable  . this is a really bad film  with bad acting and a very boring pace  lorenzo lamas is really cool though   however it is not enough  not recommended . the direction is very bad . george erschbamer does a very bad job here  with mediocre camera work  bland location  and keeping the film at a boring pace . the acting is pretty bad  except for lamas  . lorenzo lamas is awesome here  and while he isn  t required to act  he is quite fun to watch  and has a really cool character  and had a lot of charisma  however even he can  t save this one  and he had no chemistry with the cast either   lamas rules   . josie bell is terrible here  and while she  s decent looking  she isn  t very convincing and had no chemistry with lamas . cheryl jeans is hot  but does not have much to do but scream and scared  she did okay at that . robert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain  and wasn  t menacing at all  he was laughable as were the other  . rest of the cast are bad . overall avoid  avoid   even if you do like lamas  like me  .  out of   

=======================================================================================================

1397 ===> the sarah silverman program is . . . better than those other shows . no laugh tracks  no painful jokes  just a program . the sarah silverman program . if you  re like me  and you love comedy  this is probably a show for you .  br    br   sarah silverman brings out  there  funny  and right  here  funny to the table with ease . a mix of different styles  which makes for its own .  br    br   this program isn  t something you want to start a compare war with  seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them  other shows  . this show is its own entity  and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine .  br    br   go watch and see .  

=======================================================================================================

1398 ===> best show since seinfeld . she  s really really funny . her total self centeredness  the hulking gay stoner neighbors  the departures into song or cartoons  make this the freshest show on tv . one of the few shows i make point of watching . the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore   oh wait now that you  re close you do look old  turns face with finger and walks away lol   the cough syrup overdose  sleeping with god  it  s all so funny or so stupid it  s just a lot of fun . the shows weak points are her sister and the cop  only because they  re too darn normal   i really can  t wait until the next show  something i haven  t felt for any show in a long time .  

=======================================================================================================

1399 ===> words can  t simply describe how awful this film is . i watched it on video last night  and i simply could not believe what i was seeing . basically   snakeeater  is about an ex  military man  lorenzo lamas  and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance  style rednecks . the film  s acting  writing  direction  photography  and editing are deplorable along with a song called  soldier  that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time   br    br   however  there is one treat .  horshack   ron pallio  from  welcome back carter  is in the film playing a laughable bad guy . otherwise  please avoid this mess at all costs .  

=======================================================================================================

1400 ===>   that  malcom  show on fox is really making a killing . . . can  t we do our own version   i speculate and paraphrase  of course  but in our hearts we all know it  s true  and that the only thing nbc added to the  malcom  metric was sex . and  boy  did they add sex . . .  br    br   thirteen  year  old tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard . tucker accidentally walks in on his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off . he spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window  and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window . and this is all in the pilot .  br    br   take it from a grown man  a boy  s puberty is so sex  crazy and testicle  driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience . the only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies  and you can count those on one hand . so it  s no surprise that  tucker  has the warmth and appeal of a strip  club bathroom . did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty  isn  t this the stuff people go to jail for  if you doubt the show  s depravity consider this   episodes were filmed but nbc canceled it after only  episodes aired they then made the unprecedented move of  burning off  the remaining episodes by airing them at midnight so no children could see them . ironic since kids were originally the target audience .  br    br   apart from its general scuzziness tucker features a running voice  over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing . even in     it was horribly dated  with it  s ska incidental music and super  sarcasm . i couldn  t like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn  t exactly come a mile  a  minute . . . shame on nbc for this dirty rip  off . . . they  re better than that .  br    br   grade c   

=======================================================================================================

1401 ===> the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah  s own stand up it  s so over the top with prejudice that you can  t possibly take it to heart . the fact is  though  that while most all people will  get it   it doesn  t mean they will all appreciate it . it  s a very polarizing and one dimensional show  so if you don  t like it after   minutes  you may as well give up there . if you do like it after   minutes  stay tuned  because every episode thus far has been as good as the last .  br    br   like all shows  though  it is not perfect . personally i love the program  but there are some huge faults with it . racist songs are funny  but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize   a problem that i had with  jesus is magic  as well . it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn  t need to exist . not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good  the music  well  isn  t .  br    br   another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python  upright citizens brigade  etc .  it is nothing like those shows . i can watch monty python all day  but  as much as i like this show  i can  t watch more than the half hour limit at a time . it gets flat very fast . the repeat value for this show is low too   the second time around an episode is fairly funny  and by the third time  in my opinion  it  s boring .  br    br   still  that first time around is very  very funny . give it a shot .  

=======================================================================================================

1402 ===> following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use . the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah  s erratic persona which  beyond general insensitivity  has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on  making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene . sarah  s ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed . every time she speaks it  s like a self  contained  second skit . she overemotes a lot  demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify  but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied . this may be the most creative  original and experimental tv program ever .  

=======================================================================================================

1403 ===> what were they thinking at  cannes   one of the most irritating  films of all time . every detail of this film  no matter how meaningless was shown . if i had to watch her put on those boots one more time i think i would have shouted . if the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life rosetta had  then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running . but no  we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over . the whole thing was filled with un  likeable and unsympathetic characters . they deserved the misery that was rosetta . and to think i passed up  tumbleweeds  to see this over  hyped film of boredom . it was like watching grass grow  only that is more exciting .  

=======================================================================================================

1404 ===> i go to the cinema to be entertained . there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film . from beginning to end  there is no respite from the gray  grinding reality of this woman  s life . it is one  paced  with no change of mood . i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better . they don  t  and i don  t think i was the only one  as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close . honestly depicting social depravation is no crime  but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public . a dreadful film .  

=======================================================================================================

1405 ===> this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud . in other places  i have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious  politically correct prigs . there is neither here  unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid .  br    br   the lines are hilarious  and all the leads have never been better . melvin douglas is especially brilliant .  br    br   if you  ve ever thought of or tried to build a new house  you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process  no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel  you are not alone   

=======================================================================================================

1406 ===> when i first saw this show  i thought it looked interesting . i watched it  saw how it revolved around sarah  like the character sees the world . . . revolving around her . i got it  but wasn  t laughing very much .  br    br   onstage and in her show  she  s racist  crude  insensitive and hugely self  centered . i didn  t get her at first  and took it all at face value . then i got to see her movie  jesus is magic . i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me  explaining to me just what  language  she  s speaking . she  s like marilyn manson  working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images  but you eventually realise it isn  t an assault  it  s a statement . and once you understand that  you find you  re glad someone  s finally giving it to you straight .  br    br   i don  t mean to suggest only smart people will understand  or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy . while i like a lot of  smart  shows  i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm . i get the impression that it  s good  but i just don  t get it . many people will never get the sarah silverman program  but i  m glad i eventually came around .  br    br   the creators of this show do work hard  every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot  but with songs  or dream sequences  production numbers . these people aren  t putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers  they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together . if i was to predict the future of this show  i  d say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks  geeks . it will get canceled before it  s time and live on in fans  hearts and on dvd . but take heart  ssp creators  your audience is out there  and we  ll be watching for as long as they let you make the show .  

=======================================================================================================

1407 ===> if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease  inducing dogme   style  i would never have rented it . nevertheless  i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot . i lasted a very  very  very long forty minutes before giving up . it  s just boring  pretentious twaddle .  br    br   the last french movie i saw was  romance  and it too was pretty dismal  but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time . i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme   overseas   it  ll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy .  it  s called dogme   because that  s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera .   br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1408 ===> i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d  or at the     cannes film festival because it was atrocious  i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn  t believe that someone would make such a worthless film . there is nothing interesting about the plot  the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects . also  if you do decide to waste  hours of your life by watching this film  be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand  held camcorder and half the time you can  t even see the main subjects . this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as  blair witch  because it creates suspense . in rosetta  there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything . i should have known better when it came on at  o  clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible .  

=======================================================================================================

1409 ===> sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch  she  s beautiful  sexy  funny and talent  dark and demonic . i read the other  comment  on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don  t get it . nothing that appears on t . v . is an accident . too much money  time and work is put into the production of a t . v . show for there to be mistakes . this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid . this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile . i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre . it  s a lot like pee  wee  s playhouse for maladjusted  slacker twenty  something glue sniffing  future pornstars of america from the valley . the cast is awesome . the scenarios and action is well  paced . i hope this show succeeds since comedy central didn  t let david spade keep his show . who plays sarah  s sister  she not in the cast listing on the show  s home page . i would love to see her stand  up . does anyone know about her up  coming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there   

=======================================================================================================

1410 ===> i think this show is screamingly funny  it  s not for every taste  and i  m not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don  t get it . i  m sure they  re wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength . but if you like it  you really like it . sarah plays a self  infatuated loser named  sarah silverman  who often finds her self in homerian predicaments  that  s  homerian  as in  homerian simpsonian   .  br    br   i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early    s . i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she  s done .  br    br   this show is choke  on  your  food  and  wet  your  pants funny . therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers . check it out   

=======================================================================================================

1411 ===> this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god  awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television . the house  mates are dull  uninteresting  ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them . as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society  showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain  dead morons . whatever happened to television that didn  t target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience  this cannot be classified as entertainment . i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul . it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and  once moving to channel    become horribly unfunny . with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made .  

=======================================================================================================

1412 ===> if there was a  stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste . the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse . the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine  but wheres the experiment  all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don  t know or want to know about . . . the challenges are pathetic and silly . the whole point of reality tv is to show reality . if you set a  challenge  don  t make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in  friday night games  . make them do an actual challenge . and as for  earning  prize money  thats fine  if they actually earnt it  these people are nuts . if only they would make the show better  the actual idea would be glorious . but that ain  t gonna happen   

=======================================================================================================

1413 ===> i originally scored sarah  s show with a nice fat   but i  ve struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin  is what  s settled in . i shall explain .  br    br   you will either like sarah  s humor  or you won  t . if you don  t  i doubt anyone could persuade you . you folks know who you are and it  s perfectly fine  but then you know that too . moving on  the first season gave us fantastic bits about sarah  her friends and family  and her pursuits in life . in one memorable episode  she is  pulled over  by officer jay whom she meets for the first time .   do you know why i am standing here   he asks .  because you got all c  s in high school   she quizzically replies . it seemed to be a genuine question .  that is funny stuff in my book . sarah can come at you from odd angles . in another episode  her affair with god was notably funny . god being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke . it is clever  it is a twisted view  but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed .  br    br   then  came the second season . while still not without some new and inventive comedy  we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes  quite simply . i get some good laughs here and there  but much of it seems like filler while she  and the writers  struggle to foment some original material . sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings i have for the episodes lately  but i have been gutting it out for the gems i do find  the turtle  and waiting for her to turn it around . i was a fan of her  jesus is magic  routine and would like to think that i understand what she is capable of . let  s get back to that .  

=======================================================================================================

1414 ===> for those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity  you are in fact the mindless one . while the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems  racial barriers  clich  s  stereotypes etc . you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it .  br    br   what i also love is that not everything is a punchline . for those expecting a formulated joke like friends  i love friends fyi   you won  t find it here . instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic . we don  t walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said  which is in most comedies . instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense .  br    br   so don  t take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that .  

=======================================================================================================

1415 ===> i bought this movie from gamestop  s discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for   cents . the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike . not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey .  br    br   the director more than likely committed a murder  suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros . film and he ended up owing money to the studio . it also doesn  t help that he wasn  t even infamous for the terrible job he did  he wasn  t even known for producing a poop  chute film .  br    br   why was this movie ever made   

=======================================================================================================

1416 ===> i am a student of film  and have been for several years . and the concept of a cyber  kung  fu  satirical chimpanzee had me wondering   is this the film that  s going to break the mold   let  s face it  america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar . after such great classics as  monkey trouble  and  dunston checks in   i thought that the best ideas were already taken . but then comes  funky monkey  . i laughed  i cried  i contemplated suicide .  br    br   now i  ve read about demon possession in the bible  but that still doesn  t explain why someone would create such a product of evil . first off  having at least a shred of intelligence  i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape  not a monkey at all . however  i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film . they didn  t . let me sum up this work of art a company by the name of z . i . t . has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers . why  i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas  but when it would cost about an estimated   million dollars of government money to train one chimp  this doesn  t seem cost  effective . well anyways  z . i . t . brings in a cia specialist  matthew modine  to train clemens  the chimp  . clemens is everything z . i . t . hoped for . he can take out an entire shift of guards  who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall  and yet still manage to remind us that we  re watching a kid  s movie . as you may have guessed  modine finds out that z . i . t .  s intentions may be evil  gasp   and decides to break clemens out . being a cia agent and all  modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city  rent a guest room  regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime  and using checks to pay for everything .  br    br   z . i . t . finds out where modine is staying  and sends two of their finest to retrieve him . these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis  or was it turner and hooch  it doesn  t matter anyways  because in the end  for a heck of a twist ending  the good guys win    yay  hooray for predictability  throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself  a lonely mom who needs a date  and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get  funky monkey  . the climax to the movie  a football game  played by thugs  bumblers  a chimp  and the nerd boy . no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game .  br    br   funky monkey never lets up  it  s edge of your seat entertainment . some might even call this the  american beauty  of monkey  filled features . after finishing this epic  i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe . funky monkey is a metal rod among movies .  

=======================================================================================================

1417 ===> this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn  t stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight  despite the fact that i  ve seen all the episodes previously  . i  ve always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience . i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time . . . i can  t say that about many tv shows . . . can you  this show is finally something new and interesting and  most importantly  funny  this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out . you owe it to yourself to watch this show . . . i predict a long run for this series . . . and just to be clear  the people who are offended by this show just don  t get it . . . perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it . . . they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don  t understand . anyone who uses the word  bigot  in reference to silverman  or who claims that she only aims to  shock  . . . is way off the mark . . . she  s exactly the opposite just google her and you  ll quickly see that she  s a huge proponent of civil rights  etc . if you don  t know that she  s ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints  you don  t get it . and if you don  t get it  do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1418 ===> all i can say is  if you don  t fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie  then you  re not human  even after watching it for the first time  i was hooked . it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe  as i  m sure other fans will attest to . after watching it  you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us . at least we have grey gardens to remember them  i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with . although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy  she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do . what a rare treat to have know such people i only wish i had

1419 ===> i  m a fan of the series and have read all  books . i wanted to see this just to see how it was done . all i can say  is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it . its pretty bad  and will turn you off reading them . not to be mean  but lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie . was she the directors daughter  seriously  i  m sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth . she had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame . the movie just loses so much in translation . cs books don  t translate as easily as the tolkein lotr books  or even harry potter .  br    br   one thing they did right  aslan  very well done . although the other human actors with painted faces  beavers  wolf  look silly  aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around .  i guess its like that old horse custume   people inside   also  i would be curious what kids think of this movie . maybe they would enjoy it  but as for adults  safe bet they wont  even if a cs fan .  

=======================================================================================================

1420 ===> i watched this a few days ago  so details are getting hazy . the film is shot on hand  held cameras  and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally  since we hadn  t had many studio pictures made in this way . i can  t help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything  designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn  t had all the compromises that come with a big budget  and so was more  real  . however what we have here isn  t much more than a not  as  good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket  so anyone who has seen that  or any one of the other rip offs there of  will know what to expect .  br    br   the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters  with the weedy soft kids out of their depth  close harmony singing  ebonics spouting black dudes  world weary sergeants  bitter and twisted psychos etc etc . . . all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time . maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation  maybe it was laziness  or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience  all i know is it was annoying . one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees  where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation   although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it . this seems to be the main pivot of the plot  with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth  but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way . the other big bug i had was how all the characters  with the exception of the psychos and the real softies  would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence  faced with farrell  s ubiquitous stoicism  immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic .  br    br   i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads  which was strong and very convincing  tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters  this wasn  t too hard .  br    br   in my imagination  bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty  and for my money   episodes of that would be more fun to watch .  

=======================================================================================================

1421 ===> i really can  t remember who recommended this  but they said it was one of their favorite films . it is certainly a strange one  like rubbernecking at a highway accident .  br    br   someone said that truth is stranger than fiction  and the truth here is something to see . i really can  t understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year . how can you improve on this  the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton  s . in the process they become recluses and what is best described as  crazy cat ladies .  they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie . this film was done after that rescue . all during  you couldn  t help but think   how bad was it before   it  s a look at high society from the darker side  and it is utterly fascinating .  

=======================================================================================================

1422 ===> one of the best love stories i have ever seen . it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion  but lovely nonetheless . . . big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly  and are infinitely quotable  it  s a goddamned beautiful day  now will you just shut up   the opening explanation of little edie  s costume only promises that the movie will live on forever  and so will big edie  the world famous singer  and little edie  the world famous dancer .   

=======================================================================================================

1423 ===> though the movie may have been  true  to lewis  s book  in that the script was basically word  for  word  verbatim   it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this . the mythical creatures  unicorns  centaurs  griffins  ghouls  ghosts  are drawn in  and as in the previous review  the green  screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow . i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth i nearly cried when i heard the wolf  s  howl    a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could .  br    br   all of the acting is tremendously forced  especially that of little lucy penvensie . . . i could only take so much indignation  desperation  and buck teeth in the  what felt like  fourteen hours of watching the movie . the actress who plays the white witch  in all her histrionics  seems that she  d be more at home on stage  where a booming voice  spread arms  and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome .  br    br   the sets feel claustrophobic  whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors . indoors  it  s as if bbc could only afford to spend     on constructing a set  and so it is very small  and all the characters are constantly huddled together . the white witch  s castle is a run  down  rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting . when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods   actually  any scene in the woods   feels like they are simply wandering around in circles .  br    br   the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan  but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film  s entire budget on building the mechanical feline . it looks great when it  s standing still and before it starts speaking  but once it starts moving  you can  t help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear  end in the lion suit .  br    br   yes  if you are a hardcore narnia fan  you may want to see this version  simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote   but lewis was certainly no screenwriter  and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen . during the scene in which the children are at the beavers  and getting ready to flee from the wolves  mrs . beaver  s incessant   oh  just one more thing  dearies  and then we will be ready to go   punctuated by the children  s simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of  no  mrs . beaver  please     a scene of comic relief  so incongruous  they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger  not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not   detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have . in fact  the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these .  br    br   i would recommend seeing the new narnia  disney      . the new movie  with updated effects  spectacular computer animation  great timing all around  and a gorgeous and scene  stealing white witch  who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician  as opposed to a shrieking banshee  captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis  s original vision  i think  . lucy is a lot cuter  no buck teeth  yay    as are the beavers  and realistically  sized   and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine  desperately  hungry  for  acceptance  insecure  and  angsting  with  an  inferiority  complex edmund that the new disney version fronts .  br    br   unless you  re the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies  i would not recommend this film to anyone .  

=======================================================================================================

1424 ===> this movie is terrible but it has some good effects .  

=======================================================================================================

1425 ===> i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill  jackie kennedy  s sister and the cousin of these women  would encourage the maysles  to make  big edie  and  little edie  the subject of a film . they certainly could be considered the  skeletons  in the family closet . the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women . i  d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating .  i . e .  are they nuts  or am i missing something    . this movie is hard to come by . netflix does not have it . facets does  though .  

=======================================================================================================

1426 ===> when it first came out  this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation . luckily  it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema  especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television  and the bad evolution of most direct cinema .  br    br   really  at first  we must say that this isn  t really direct cinema  it is more cinema verit . the difference between the two is very slight  but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary  we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers  and they do interact with the characters filmed . this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation . the meysels have been allowed in the house  and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household . and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed .  br    br   it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews . here  we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house  a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith . their house is a mess  litter and animals everywhere  faded colors and furniture all over the house  and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality . these two people have lived with each other their whole life  and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention  but rather because they can  t help talking to each other this way . they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings  there is no need . in the end  though  even as they blame each other for their lives  they really love each other deeply . edie says she doesn  t want her mother to die  because she loves her very much  and edith says that she doesn  t want edie to leave her because she doesn  t want to be alone .  br    br   but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age  the two women can  t help be girls . they cannot help being one the singer  the other the dancer . exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera . when edie asks david meysels rhetorically  where have you been all my life   she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills . a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again  the way only the meysels and few others could do .  

=======================================================================================================

1427 ===> i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival . sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin . being a devout fan of lewis carroll  s  alice  books i was very excited about this movie  s premier  which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch . normally i  m enthusiastic about modern re  tellings if they are treated well . usually it  s interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story . unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion . the adaptation of the original  s characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying . it probably didn  t help that the actors weren  t very good either . most performances were ridiculously over the top  which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script . i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film . all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by . really  the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice  but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman  s work . also  i  d have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance  off was awful . it was with out a doubt the low point of the film .  br    br   what a joke . don  t see this movie . after its conclusion i was genuinely angry .  

=======================================================================================================

1428 ===> i  m actually watching this film as i write this . . . if the following comments  prove my lack of development as a true  artistic film maker   then so be it . . .  br    br   but . . . i thought  am still thinking as i  m presently viewing  that this film . . . to put it mildly  is very  very overrated . again  very .  br    br   it looks like a really  really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources . . . and who didn  t pay that much attention to detail .  br    br   i don  t want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking  but . . . well . . . i just don  t get it  rememeber  i fully admit that maybe it  s me that  s the idiot here  not the film maker  for not getting this  piece of imaginative genius   . . . i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very  very outstanding . . .  br    br   sheesh . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1429 ===> grey gardens is a world unto itself . edith and little edie live in near total isolation  eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their  apparently  shared bedroom . cats loll about while mother edith insults her daughter  s elocution . this is a tennessee williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights  as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is     real .  br    br   the situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her    ish daughter lived for a decade  other than that they were poor and clean  . they would bicker all day  grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men  work  and self  expression .  br    br   this film is a must  see for anyone writing a mother  daughter relationship of this kind . it is sad and voyeuristic  but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly . it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context   remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion .  

=======================================================================================================

1430 ===> i first saw this movie in my plays  playwrights course at tulane . i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was . it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude . the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core . as a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming  little edie became infatuated with one of the camera men .  the beauty  i find  comes from the naturalness of the family  s dysfunction . it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little edie  s rehabilitation to society . in all  the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it  s portrayal of surprising beauty . two thumbs way up   

=======================================================================================================

1431 ===> believe me  i like horror movies . i like science fiction movies . i like independent films . and  i like low  budget  b movies .  br    br   sometimes  i even like bad acting  plodding scripts  wooden lines  improbably situations  and the like . however  i did not like christmas on mars .  br    br   it just doesn  t work on so many levels . for all the reasons listed previously  and many more . that includes the nonsensical  blatant use of images of female genitalia . and the many allusions to male genitalia  in a very freudian way .  br    br   i am convinced this is purely from ineptitude . as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different . i mean any movie that takes years to film  just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences .  br    br   i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character . however  sadly  it was meant to have happened  as we saw things unfold on screen .  br    br   about the only kindness that i can express  is that the image at the end was stupendous . if this had been used at the beginning  instead of the end  it could have allowed the film to take off where     ended . . .  br    br   to bad they didn  t try that instead . i just don  t understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made . was it the plot  surely  it couldn  t be . was it the characters  i doubt it i mean  i could live without knowing about ed   . was it the dialog  emphatically  no . the music  perhaps  but more  likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked .  br    br   much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor .  

=======================================================================================================

1432 ===>  this contains many  many spoilers  not that it matters  since everything is so patently obvious   br    br   oh my god  where do i start  well  here  this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said  i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now . it is my civic duty .  such is the badness of this flick .  br    br   begin digression but let me just state one thing before i start . i  m not some harvard  art  major  film  noir  weenie  in fact  i went to the college at the other end of mass . ave in cambridge  the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go  which should put me squarely in the nerd  who  would  obsessively  love  comic  book  films census group  and still i hated this film . . .  . my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards  bond flicks  clerks  and the grail . i wish the titanic had never sunk  not so much for the lives lost  but so we wouldn  t have been subjected to that dung  heap of a film . and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it . i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few   s here on imdb  for god  s sake . so i  m as shallow as they come  therefore i  m not criticizing this film because i  m looking for some standard of cinematic excellence  it  s because elektra stinks like a three  week  old dead goat . end digression  br    br   ok  there  s so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it . here goes  br    br   ms . garner one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar  i have no idea why my wife wanted to  . i think that between this and  finding nemo   the latter was the sexier film . you know the red outfit she  s advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see  you see her in it twice  once at the beginning  once at the end . bummer . in the rest  she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female  lots of pouting and black clothes . which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting  ranging from  pouting  all the way to  pouting and crying  . oh my god  you  d think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that . um  wait . . .  br    br   the bad guys  gal they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you  d expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit . at least next to jgar  s performance  it doesn  t stand out too badly . one guy  s role is to stand there and be huge  another  s is to stand there and have stuff come out of him  and the woman  s role is to stand there and breathe on and  or kiss people . they manage to pull these incredible feats off . the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all  he has to simultaneously a  appear angry and b  appear asian . he does a fine job at this . i think there was a fifth bad guy  gal  but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self  defense .  br    br   plot twists  this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention . let  s just put it this way  my wife  who has only been in the u . s . for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english  whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jg  s pad  and i swear to god i am not making this up  she go to house to kill girl . and father too .  and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen . now my wife isn  t stupid  but she isn  t being courted by mensa for her gifts  either  and she  s had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre . and she figured this out in .      seconds with no prodding and no prior information . such is the blatant obviousness of this film .  br    br   rarely  before  seen stupidity  ok  so there  s this big dude in the film . he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it  s lint  and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal  or melt it  or something  more defenses kicking in  thank god  . but jg jumps on his head  and he explodes  an achilles noggin  ok  such is the mind  numbing stupidity of this film .  br    br   ack . i  m starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on  so i have to stop . but you have been warned . if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie  do it . and if armageddon is going to come  please let it be  before  this comes out on dvd .  

=======================================================================================================

1433 ===> i knew about but had never seen grey gardens  before i saw the broadway musical of the same name . friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie  the musical would not make sense . it did  but it also prompted me to rent the movie . at first  i thought it was a train wreck  full of strange  shrieking characters  and it was exceedingly hard to watch . but being able to stop it  digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary .  br    br   both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self  consciousness is worth witnessing . both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age . they have a relationship that will chill any woman  and undoubtedly some men  and make you re  examine your own dealings with your mother . in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace  it  s fascinating to see the mayleses  work from three decades ago  and realize what an impact the film must have had .  br    br   i echo what other posters have said how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family  but beyond that  how could two people living in the     s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion  or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped  i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track  which gave me additional insight into the film .  

=======================================================================================================

1434 ===> i first saw this film in     in the midday movie spot . after many subsequent viewings  and purchase of the video  it still makes me laugh out loud .  br    br   yes  it  s a relic of another age  a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america  but well executed is well executed . but it  s also a document of its age  a celebration of post  war optimism  the baby boom and the nascent consumer age . this film is no  guilty  pleasure .  br    br   three wonderful sophisticated leads actors  urbane melvyn douglas bemused cary grant daffily determined myrna loy  complement each other and a memorable team of characters .  br    br   my favourite scenes   it means we gotta blast  and  miss stellwaggen  and  this little piggy  .  br    br   love it .  

=======================================================================================================

1435 ===> while some scenes of training were realistic  too many of them depicted military instructors as ex  nazi types . obviously  the people who wrote the screen play were either anti  military types or writing a film for that audience .  br    br   i am a viet nam vet and  even during this period  military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison .  br    br   and i really loved the scene where the  hero  and his buddy  both privates  are sitting down in the captain  s office  smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their buddy . this sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation  as was the purpose for the scene .  br    br   at the end i asked myself   what was this film about   as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except  i hate all authority .  thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it .  

=======================================================================================================

1436 ===> this is absurd  aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick  i can  t help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra  considering how generous they were with their praise .  br    br   admittedly i  m not really a fan of comic  book  to  movie conversions so i didn  t go in with many expectations  yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming . the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained  that left you thinking  huh  what relevance does that have to the plot   or  so how did that aspect of the character come about   i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil  which i have no intention of seeing .  br    br   furthermore  the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about  face at random moments to suit the storyline  and don  t even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub  plot . i  m also  still  scratching my head over the fate of cary  hiroyuki tagawa  s character  which seems to have gone by unexplained .  br    br   if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot  but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra . i know we  re supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy  action films  but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing  even by action film standards  that it simply frustrated me .  br    br   well  hell  at least jennifer garner looks damn good .  

=======================================================================================================

1437 ===> grey gardens is shocking  amusing  sad and mesmerizing . i watched in amazement as ediths jr . and sr . bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past . their existence in a dilapidated mansion   which they had not left for more than fifteen years  is both a comedy and a tragedy . this is a film you will not soon forget .  

=======================================================================================================

1438 ===> i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title . it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films . it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully . it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world . i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it . it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric beales  a true aristocratic family . it has a tangible atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all  cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table . it has an air of sadness that permeates throughout . a fall from greatness for this once esteemed family . the money had gone but their airs and graces remained  as well as their beauty . it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate . wondering that if i took a walk along east hampton beach i might still hear old edie  s voice in the night and see the silhouette of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper . unforgettable .  

=======================================================================================================

1439 ===> this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film . it was a big wannabee . it wanted to be an edgy  nervous  laughter  urban  life affirming film  but it  s more of a camera jerky  mess . it  s a lot easier to imitate something else  than to create a real story with real characters . from the beginning  i couldn  t care less about the characters or what they were involved in . they were always always hitting  pissing  or crying on each other . only  there wasn  t any substance to what they were doing . the dialog between characters is meant to be hip  revealing  instead it comes out trite  and one scene after another is predictable . i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie  so i could be wrong .  

=======================================================================================================

1440 ===> if you loved  pulp fiction  and like hand held cameras you should love this film . i liked the quirky story  even though i feel that  pulp fiction  was the most over  rated movie since  the english patient   and found the characters unrealistic but interesting . it  s not  on the waterfront  or  citizen kane  and is burdened by european pretentiousness . but the worst part by far is the hand held camera . it is so distracting and annoying i found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end . i don  t know why new directors think this method of filming is so great . if you are prone to motion sickness  stay away  the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about   minutes .  

=======================================================================================================

1441 ===> why should you watch this  there are certainly no reasons why you shouldn  t watch it  superbly and amusingly directed by albert and david maysles  grey gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of east hampton  but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two edith bouvier beales  the aunt and cousin of jacqueline kennedy onassis . their life was certainly an amusing one  edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas  edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats  one was named ted z . kennedy  the film is interesting because it is both funny and sad  edith died shortly after the film was released  in february      aged   after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the film  she danced and sang in a nightclub edie beale jr was born in     and is still living in miami beach . this film is both engaging and spellbounding .

1443 ===> this movie blows  let  s get that straight right now . there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot . colin farrel looks like brad pitt in    monkeys  and acts in a similar manner . i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he  s ok in this movie . there were two plot lines in this movie   one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache . let  s face it  this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go . the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script . the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene . but overall  don  t bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf  an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success .  

=======================================================================================================

1444 ===> a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one . it needed some dependence on something .  br    br   this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people . were they trying to imitate the wonderful film  crash   if so  this film crashed entirely .  br    br   there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem .  br    br   the film is just too choppy to work . one woman loses her husband after   years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor . this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing . the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance .  br    br   then  we have  losers who purchase masks to rob a bank . obviously  the robbery goes awry but there doesn  t seem to be any punishment for the crooks . perhaps  the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film .  

=======================================================================================================

1445 ===> i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night  having no idea of the film  s cult  influence  or that it is currently being staged as a musical .    most of the comments here are on target  it  s moving  funny  sad  and yes  a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers . the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out .  br    br   i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared  you can hear it in old films of jackie o too people just don  t talk like that anymore . i think as a documentary  it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute  old edie at least still seems aware of what  s going on to a certain degree couldn  t she see the once spectacular home disintegrating   br    br   yet the film  s subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now  a real life tennesse williams one act . well worth your time .  

=======================================================================================================

1446 ===> several years ago when i first watched  grey gardens  i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp . years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it  but after many viewings i  ve come to see the beauty in the strange  twisted relationship between the inseparable  big  edith bouvier beale and her daughter  little  edith bouvier beale .  br    br   mother and daughter living together in their decaying   room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term  shabby chic  . with innumerable cats  raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o . allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day . the result is a hilarious  beautiful  sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule .  br    br   the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love . and their lives an example of drive  determination and free  will . this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words . it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1447 ===> usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn  t have a lower rating  and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating . this is not the case here .  br    br   bonesetter is a perfect example of a     film . it does nothing right and it doesn  t have the chance to because it doesn  t really attempt to do anything . there are strands of a bad dd novel kind of plot which doesn  t hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout . it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort  because even a completely patently untalented persons  hard work would amount to more . a truly awful film .  

=======================================================================================================

1448 ===> words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is . i wish it were  so bad it  s good   but it  s not . it  s just dull  lifeless  and boring . it  s so bad i couldn  t even laugh at it .  br    br   in response to other posters  anne  marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie . the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly  who as a true statement on vanity  cast himself as the male lead . they both look like inbreeds  sister and brother .  br    br   the gal  sherry thurig  is a looker . the complete opposite of anne  marie  attractive . this girl is tall and willowy  and can act . although you can tell she  s holding back .  br    br   all the actors seem to be holding back  especially the supporting male  mark . i  ve seen less wood in a rain forest  but he  s still better than kelly . why would kelly keep his actors from acting  is he really that bad a director  everyone else has summed the story up perfectly  there isn  t one . kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime . i know how he felt stepping in the poo  it  s how i felt after watching his movie .  br    br   yes  i tried to get my money back from the rental store . this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director  and if you search them out  you  ll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks  .  

=======================================================================================================

1449 ===> i stopped short of giving  mr . blandings builds his dream house       due to an aspect that makes us in the   st century cringe a little bit the fact that a black person is the faithful servant  somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit  . but other than that  the movie  s a hoot . portraying middle class new york couple jim  cary grant  and muriel blandings  myrna loy  trying to build a house in connecticut  this flick has something for everyone .  br    br   grant is his usual flippant self  while loy does quite well as merely a wife . but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim  s and muriel  s lawyer bill cole  who seems to have more plans than he  s making clear . as for the house itself . . . throughout most of the movie  you  ll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there . the builders  contractors  and others also provide their fair share of laughs .  br    br   all in all  a comedy classic . also starring louise beavers  reginald denny  sharyn moffett  connie marshall and jason robards sr .  

=======================================================================================================

1450 ===> i saw this film a couple of weeks ago  and it  s been stuck in my head ever since . it stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary . to get the true story of the beales  i had to wade through all of the dvd  s bonus material and commentaries and search the web .  br    br   although the maysles and their fans  not to mention edith and edie themselves  bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative  this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word . very little effort is every made to explain the beales or how they came to the condition they were in  the maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous . the sound  even on the criterion re  release is poor and difficult to follow . although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film  it  s ironic to compare it to geraldo rivera  s    far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at willowbrook state school in staten island from      four years before grey gardens was shot .  br    br   to paraphrase a review in the new yorker  there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives  and a documentary wasn  t one of them .  br    br   as for edith and edie  the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was  where the hell is their family   they were living in dangerous  unhealthy  unsafe conditions . how is it that jackie o  married to one of the richest men on earth  or the wealthy bouvier family themselves  couldn  t afford to get edith and edie a decent home  or at the very least hire a part  time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both  it  s shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire bouvier family .  br    br   although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries . perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary  bringing in the rich backstory  and afterstory  of the beales and the whole subsection of hamptons society in the      s .  

=======================================================================================================

1451 ===> a truly frightening film . feels as if it were made in the early    s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good  normal  mainstream  aspiring people . retrograde to the point of being offensive  ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad  lonely  sex  crazed gays . wow  who knew  the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes  the effeminate buffoon  the bitter  lonely queen  the fag hag  etc .  and the main characters are milquetoast  middle  class  middlebrow clones  of little interest .  br    br   as far as the romantic  ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned  there  s not much to say we  ve seen it all before  and done much better .  

=======================================================================================================

1452 ===> or listening to  for that matter . even the soundtrack is a bore .  br    br   honestly  this isn  t the worst gay movie i  ve seen  that would be regarding billy   but it  s down there very close to the bottom of the barrel .  br    br   this thing drags and drags and drags . it  s not that the plot is inane   in the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining . there  s not one plot point you can  t see coming for ten miles down the road . the dialog is flat . the jokes are old . to add insult to injury  it  s full of one  dimensional  stereotypical gays .  br    br   nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible  much less real . there was no chemistry  no dynamic  in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we  re just told they  re in love . hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren  t compatible sexually . they like the same book  huh   br    br   the acting is not totally bad  but the pacing is excruciatingly slow . i mean  almost jarmusch  slow  but without jarmusch quality . in fact  that would be a good barometer for you . if you like jarmusch films  avoid this one .

1453 ===> i found grey garden  s to be a gripping film  an amazingly intimate  br    br   look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea forget  br    br   society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge  br    br   brood of cats and raccoons  persuing their own interests rather  br    br   mundainly  all the while chattering at the camera .  br    br   big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros .  br    br   have chosen to document . they seem like characters out of a  br    br   fellini film  only stranger  if that makes any sense . old edie is  br    br   almost fully bedridden  a pile of papers  clothes and dirty dishes  br    br   growing around her . little edie is even more interesting . she  br    br   prances around the house  always wearing a baboushka  like  br    br   headdress around her head  completely covering her hair . we  br    br   never see her hair throughout the film  nor do we ever get a hint  br    br   that she still has much . at age fifty eight  though  she is still  br    br   beautiful and full of life .  br    br   in grey gardens  we get the sense that both of these women  s  br    br   lives have become much less than what they once were . little  br    br   edie is probably the sadder of the two . while her mother  in her  br    br   earlier years  got married  made a family  lived luxuriously and  br    br   even made some recordings  the scene where  at    she sings  br    br   along with a recording of  tea for two  she made decades ago is  br    br   one of the films best scenes   edie left her promicing career as a  br    br   model to take care of her ailing mother . at    she still longed to  br    br   find her prince charming . if anything little edie is still a little girl   br    br   full of dreams of glamour and fame  and of domestic and romantic  br    br   bliss  that have yet to be fulfilled .  br    br   highlights of the film include the opening moments  where little  br    br   edie explains her outfit to the camera  the  tea for two  sequence   br    br   the birthday party  the climactic argument  the grocery deliver  br    br   scene  and the scene in the attic . the whole thing is incredibly  br    br   candid and unpretencious . and it  s made all the more remarcable  br    br   since it  s all real .  br    br   i suggest seeing grey gardens back  to  back with the kenneth  br    br   anger short puce moment . the criterion dvd is    .    but it  s  br    br   worth every penny .  

=======================================================================================================

1454 ===>   grey gardens        is the maysles  brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassis  eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down   room mansion on east hampton  long island .  big edie  bouvier beale     witty and dry and her daughter   little edie  beale      emotionally about    a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future  live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic . they amuse themselves by bickering all day  listening to the radio or singing to each other  they dont even own a television  their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special  although obviously  dysfunctional people . one of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today .  

=======================================================================================================

1455 ===> when this play was first shown by the bbc over   years ago  it would have been something quite different for the time . so therefor some people would have found it quite scary  and may well have been impressed with the special effects   br    br   looking at the play in this day and age  it doesn  t seem to be all that scary anymore  even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired .  br    br   would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel  i don  t think so . . . . . . but if you watch this play again  you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel  rushes straight through the red light   maybe that  s how it was in dickens time    br    br   you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state . surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting .  i can  t help but notice things like that   br    br   i will not take anything away from the acting  both denholm elliott  signalman  and bernard lloyd  the traveller  gave wonderful performances .  br    br   i am not at all sure what is going on . . . . . . i mean was the ghost the traveller  or what    does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story     well maybe i am the only one that don  t      br    br   to sum up . . . . .  br    br   the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout  with great character . it suffers from not being that scary these days  and a little if not very confusing in places  and has some rather unusual signalling practises . . . .  br    br   thanks for reading my review .  

=======================================================================================================

1456 ===> i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it  s about . somebody got murdered or maybe they didn  t and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn  t . this brought back memories of the good old days  bad old days   when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers . lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism  mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time . i  ve never found margaret atwood  s books easy to read . this movie continues that fine canadian tradition . it isn  t easy to watch . maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it . us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious .  

=======================================================================================================

1457 ===> i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this  many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal  documentary of not  this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes . i kept focusing on how these women  who are clinically way beyond eccentric  reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways  and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue  blood universe  perhaps some abuse  or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its  own . this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation  without going completely over the edge  as the edies do their thing  i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble  strewn bedroom  cats urinating on the bed  racoons emerging from holes in the walls  and the final scene seemed incredibly sad  like a child  s birthday party gone seriously wrong . very definitely worth seeing and seeking out  you  ll never forget it  but very disturbing .  

=======================================================================================================

1458 ===> we stumbled upon the documentary  grey gardens  last sunday and got  sucked in  without warning . everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach  eating ice cream and corn on the cob  which was cooked on the bedside table    and the cat urinating on edith  s bed and her unbelievable words   i thrive on it the smell .  we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in . spellbinding  a must see      

=======================================================================================================

1459 ===> when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film  i was intrigued . being a fan of the book  i assumed she  d be playing tony  roz  or charis  but more so  i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head  y  almost psychological  but not psychological thriller  novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn  t read the novel  and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had . the book is a complex reflection of society  women  and modern life  and i was interested to see how they used the  different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film . what they actually did was a crime .  br    br   the biggest error and confusing issue is why would oxygen  a network that advertises as being for women  take an amazing book about how complex  wonderful  and terrible women are and can be  and change the protagonist from  women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story  it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz  tony  and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that  they rushed through bulk of the book . in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it  aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with . in the film  these women aren  t people  they are characters .  br    br   in the book zenia does fake her death  but the book mentions it to get this point across  while the film wastes      minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use . they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi .  br    br   it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia  which was so wrong . zenia is a catherine zeta  jones  angelina jolie  or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type . she is a woman men can  t not adore  and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by  but in a  keep your enemies closer  kind of way . and once she gets closer  she seems totally genuine and trust worthy  despite your better judgment . she  s the kind of woman who  even when she loses  she wins she  s always still beautiful  still rich  and there are always still people out there who don  t know her game .  br    br   in the film  zenia didn  t take charis  s man  the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place . . .  but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian  and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies  . and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august  but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed . it  s was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book  but i think had i not read the book  i would have spent the whole movie confused  if i had bothered to stick with it at all .  br    br   and roz  s husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture  which was weird since zenia took roz  s business and home life in the book  which is why roz hated her so much  and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz  s husband years and years back . and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever . . . even at the party where zenia and west  in the book  had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it  and evil  bitchy  person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it . tony  s character was so wrong in this film . . . she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky  mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book . the film basically implied smart women are evil  beautiful women are evil  powerful women are evil  and women who teach yoga are off their rockers .  br    br   they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn  t necessarily as awful as she was in the book  and then  in the end  the three women convince this former cop  who  of course in the process of researching this  meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous  which of course zenia bails on  to hide zenia  s body  which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at  but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony  or they conspired together to do it . . .  and then zenia also managed to take all of roz  s money in the process . by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b  c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been .  br    br   if you aren  t confused by this breakdown of the film  then maybe you would like it  because i have read the book and seen the movie  and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused . it was terrible . i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task  but if you are going to take on the task  you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary  instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland .  br    br   are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of

1460 ===> i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood  s novel  the robber bride   and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version . a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder  and his buddy  an ex  cop journalist  tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman  s crazy female friends . it  s fortunate that the movie script fixes ms . atwood  s clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men  victims of scheming women . . .  br    br   heh . okay  you got me . if these guys are mentioned in the book  and i  m pretty sure they  re entirely made up for the movie  i  ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy . apparently  the three main female characters of the novel aren  t enough to carry the movie . zenia  s manipulations aren  t interesting unless we see them happen to a man  and a man  s life is screwed up . roz  charis  and toni tell their stories   to a man . because it  s not important if a man doesn  t hear them .  br    br   i liked the characters in the book . it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man  s story . i normally do not look for feminist angles on media  and i tried to enjoy the movie as is . if i hadn  t read the book  i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more . so if you like the cop and the ex  cop  and you want to read more about them  you  re out of luck . read the novel  if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot . it  s the same plot the movie excavated it  ironed it  and sprinkled it with male angst . it  s like zenia  s revenge on margaret atwood .

1461 ===> don  t read anything about this movie  especially nothing that could contain any spoilers  . just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it  and you  ll have a really great experience . if you like to see an intelligent  twisted story go  get the dvd and you  ll truly not be disappointed .  cypher  is not really a sci  fi movie  more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business . it  s about corporate secrets  how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them . the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness . cypher is much deeper  more complex and  what belongs the story and the ending  also much  much more satisfying than vincenzo natali  s other movies  cube  and  nothing  . actually it  s one of the best movies i  ve ever seen  and that  s something i really don  t say this about every fifth well  made flick  . sorry  can  t tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience . just give it a chance .

1462 ===>   cypher  is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future . while thematically not complex  this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty  ruthlessness  and corporate conspiracy . to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf .  br    br   the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man  morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative . after an initial briefing with digicorp  s security chief  sullivan is then given a new identity  jack thursby  and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies . upon successfully completing his first assignment  sullivan  thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered . however  on one of his  business trips  he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster   liu  whom he had met on his previous assignment  and from there things go extremely topsy  turvy . the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp  s espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp  s main competitors  thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies .  br    br     spoilers end here    br    br   what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes . vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic  household settings  while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover  up . i was also very impressed with jeremy northam . not too often have i seen him in the lead role  and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant . personally  i think he  s one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn  t been given more challenging roles . lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak  and  dagger tone . additionally  the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job  however  my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated . for example  i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second  wife .  overall  this is a cleverly developed cloak  and  dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted . with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work  this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future . i  m surprised that i had never watched this  hidden gem  before . this is a brilliant  not  too  overly complicated spy thriller  and therefore i  m giving it a  out of   .

1463 ===> warning  no plot spoilers ahead  but movie spoilers nonetheless . . .  my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all  star cast . wow  very  very wrong . this movie is an overdone  overwrought  and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film   years after it was shot  the copyright date on the box said      yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early     s  and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late   s  early   s dresses and hairdos . it looked as if it had been shot a good   or   years before the rest of the film  i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback  and therefore supposed to look old  but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more   s than   s or even   st century trying to be   s . . . then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up  and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences  yet it  s a different  much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks  . i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included  it was all the flashback sequences  shot in     as a complete student film of the same title as this movie  it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up  and indeed acting the co  worker in the     scenes  . thus  this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old  re  cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time . the shell story  shot in      is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead  something about a promise made by the dying man in the early    s to his girl that they would meet on the  fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium  an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in       these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful  overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichd action that permeates the new movie . don  t bother . there  s a reason why you  ve never heard of this movie even though it has a well  known cast  it  s terrible .  

=======================================================================================================

1464 ===> i got this movie in the   bin at walmart . i would not recommend watching this move . i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for  hours .  br    br   i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie . i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on . it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie . it  s just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another . the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam .  br    br   okay  here is my rant about this movie to me  this movie is slow and hard to watch . it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end . it doesn  t . after the movie was over i through it behind my t . v . because i was angry that i wasted almost  hours of my life watching it  and another   minutes writing this review to warn people about it .

1465 ===> cypher is a clever  effective and eerie film that delivers . its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands . although one could immediately label the film a science fiction  there is a little more to it . it has it  s obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir  detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story .  br    br   the film  overall  plays out like it  s some kind of nightmare thus building and retaining a good atmosphere . we  re never sure of what exactly is going on  we  re never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we  re not entirely sure of certain people  similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i haven  t seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before  bar terry gilliam  s brazil . going with the eeriness stated earlier  cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective  noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there  s something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well .  br    br   there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story . the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster  liu   who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale  can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero people whom appear as friends actually aren  t  people who say they  re helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look . despite a lot of switching things around  twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they  re not carried out the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu  s character  and she  s trying to help out    the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage  spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents . the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini  cold war something that resembles the u . s . a . and the u . s . s . r . in their war of word  s heyday and it really pulls through given the black  bleak  often cgi littered screen that i was glued to .  br    br   what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and foster  s own motivation this sequence disappears because he  s breaking away from the computerised  repetitive  controlled life that he  s being told to live and is branching out .  br    br   cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film . to say it resembles the first jason bourne film  only set in the sci  fi genre  isn  t cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities despite them both being released in the same year . like i mentioned earlier  there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict  you will find yourself enjoying this film .  

=======================================================================================================

1466 ===> cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it  s not the run  of  the  mill sci  fi flick . the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what  s going on . the close  up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive . the sci  fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie . the technology used in the movie isn  t overly impressive  however  the director makes good use of the props .  br    br   the character development is intentionally shallow . the main character  jeremy northam  decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage . it  s up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it  s the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end .  

=======================================================================================================

1467 ===> my brother is an avid dvd collector . he took one look at the cover  two models on toilets  and had to add it to his collection . i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie  i use that term loosely  i  ve felt obligated to sit through . i dared not make eye contact with my brother  quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist . the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark duncan who appears in one scene  which the  filmmaker  decided to show every take of  about four total  throughout the movie . in fact  the whole movie pretty much follows this suit . the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock .  i went to bed without viewing it  however  . to no surprise at all  i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later .  

=======================================================================================================

1468 ===> the underground comedy movie  is possibly the worst train wrecks i  ve ever seen . luckily i didn  t pay for this movie  and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was . i love off color comedy . i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained . no  instead the acting was so awful  the  jokes  were extremely cheesy  and the plot was no where to be found . maybe there wasn  t supposed to be a plot so i can  t hold that against this movie . it  s pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat . . . . . by batman . . . a man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat . hilarious . simply genius . i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it . perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn  t understand . or perhaps it  s the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the arctic ocean .  br    br   p . s . don  t buy this movie   

=======================================================================================================

1469 ===> this movie is a gem because it moves with soft  but firm resolution .  br    br   i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there  it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace . it  s not about explosions  car chases  or flying bullets . you must be patient and instead  note the details here . it  s sedate because that  s what the main character is . the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds .  br    br   i will not give spoilers   because that destroys the point of watching . the plot is what you  ve read from the other postings an average white  collar guy  seeking change and adventure  signs on for a corporate spy job . just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data .  br    br   take it from there .  br    br   this movie starts at a surreal walk   with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential  underlying suburban paranoia .  br    br   then it begins to accelerate .  br    br   the acting on all parts is superb   and yes  some of the acts are caricature characters . but they all fit  and they entertain . and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft  soft key sinister theme all is not right at the beginning .  br    br   and at the end all is not what it seems .  br    br   get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one   and turn up the sound this movie wants you to listen .  

=======================================================================================================

1470 ===> this is my first comment  this is a fantastic movie  i watched it all by luck one night on tv . at first  minutes i thought it was a b movie  but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was .  br    br   i suggested to some friends to see the movie  only to tell me that it was a bad b movie . how wrong . superficial critiques .  br    br   i think that the movie is almost a product of genius  the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time .  

=======================================================================================================

1471 ===> sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one . you can only stand about  minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back . i will now look at michael clarke duncan with apprehension . . . why . . . . he lent his name to this vermin .  

=======================================================================================================

1472 ===> anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie . i first saw ads for this movie back in     . it looked like it could be funny  but i wasn  t about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first . i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster .  br    br   about a year and a half later  i was at tower records and in the  dvds for less than     pile  there was a copy of this movie . seeing that the dvd was only   .   i decided to buy it . i got home  put the disc in the dvd player  and waited for the laughs to start . . . and i waited some more . the laughs never came .  br    br   i  d have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible . sick  desperately tasteless  and poorly written and directed  the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time . no stars .  

=======================================================================================================

1473 ===> who can watch a movie  look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed . that woman is amazingly beautiful  a talented actress . that  s a tough combination to find now a days . and jeremy northam . i heard his name plenty of times  but i never really noticed him . my advice to hollywood is   use him more  .  br    br   now about the movie i watched it in one of my graveyard shift . i don  t recommend that to anyone . it  s a bit to complicated  mysterious for that . i still can  t believe i didn  t see the ending coming . i  m not gonna say what cause that  ll spoil the hole movie . although saying this is spoilment enough .  br    br   now i  m suppose to cast my vote about this movie . i love the dark mystic story  the actors did a good job  i love the directors  natali  work in the past . there  s not a big audience for this kind of thing  that  s also pretty risky . you know what  i  m just gonna give this work a  cause everybody should see this . then again   point deduction cause there is always space for improvement .  

=======================================================================================================

1474 ===> wow . one of the greatest movies i have ever  ever seen .  br    br   absolutely loved it  before the opening credits were done i was glued to the screen .  br    br   it  s a sci  fi thriller  and edge of your seat whodunnit . incredible .  br    br   i wish  d it would never end .  br    br   lucy liu is a throwaway role . anyone could have played it . the lead actor  jeremy northram was the perfect geeky guy .  br    br   this movie appeals to me who loved war games  sneakers  and track down .  br    br   incredible   br    br          . walt d in lv  

=======================================================================================================

1475 ===> first of all . . . . .  br    br   what the hell  why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing  offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn  t watch .  br    br   what the crap is funny about a dog being injured  a grandma getting her head knocked off . . . a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom  what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick . anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny  should not even be allowed to walk the earth .  br    br   but from what i hear its not even offensive . . . so . . . they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage . . . and they cant even pull that off .  

=======================================================================================================

1476 ===> this movie goes beyond just being bad  it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film   if you can call it that  .  

=======================================================================================================

1477 ===> this movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named digicorp . this wimpy guy  morgan  jeremy northam  is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy . he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies  plans . instead  morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman  played by lucy liu  and pretty much being double  crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent . how will morgan get himself out of this  can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster  played by lucy liu   and more importantly  can morgan make it out alive  wow  what a nifty movie  i was completely sucked in after   minutes of watching this movie . it is very suspenseful and you can feel morgan  s fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive . the scene where they put this horrible contraption on morgan  s head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening . morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished . from a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses  he turns into a man actively fighting for his life .  br    br   the ending  wow  the ending is incredible  the twist is so much fun  it left me gasping and cheering like crazy  good performances from all around  especially from jeremy natham  lucy liu and nigel bennett .  br    br   i highly recommend this film   

=======================================================================================================

1478 ===> although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built  or bought  to your specifications  it is not the first  nor the last . in     jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s . kaufman and moss hart . and about fifteen years ago shelly long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit . the former was about moving into an   th century country house that . . . err  needs work . the latter was about building your dream house  in the late     s . although the two films have their moments  both are not as good as blandings  which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name .  br    br   jim blandings and his wife muriel  cary grant and myrna loy  are noticing the tight corners of their apartment  which they share with their two daughters joan and betsy  sharyn moffett and connie marshall  . although blandings has a good income as an advertising executive  in     he is making        .   a year  which was like making        .   today   and lives in a luxury apartment  which in the new york city of that day he rents   he feels they should seek something better . he and muriel take a drive into the country  connecticut  and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want .  br    br   and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to . for one thing  they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise  if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole  melvin douglas  in a nicely sardonic role  . for example  jim buys land from a connecticut dealer  ian wolfe  sucking his chops quietly   with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of connecticut . bill points out he  s paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth . there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about  such as hard and soft water  which leads to the zis  zis water softening machine . they find that the designs they have in mind  and have worked out with their architect  reginald denny   can  t be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for .  br    br   the escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils jim . he has been appointed to handle the  wham  account   spam  had become a popular result of world war ii  in that the public started using it as a meat substitute  in the light of it  s success with the armed forces  . jim can  t get a grip on this  he  s not alone  one or two other executives fumbled it before him  . he comes up with the following bit of  poetry       br    br    this little piggy went to market   br    br   he was pink and as pretty as ham .  br    br   he smiled in his tracks   br    br   as they gave him the ax   br    br   he knew he would end up as  wham     br    br   his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one   br    br   jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of bill to muriel  although  in this case  bill is blameless . but he  s always around  jim keeps forgetting that bill is the clearheaded one  and that he  s keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes  . all three have mishaps  the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house  just as the men have left for the day . they can  t open the door  and jim  in a panic  tries breaking the door down by a make  shift battering ram . he breaks a window  and the door opens by itself .  br    br   the film works quite satisfactorily  with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves . it is one film which  despite changing price levels and salary levels  really does not age at all . after all  most americans dream of owning their own home and always have .  br    br   a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and emory parnell regarding the paint job parnell  s company has to do on the various rooms . she carefully shows the distinct shades of red  blue  etc . she wants  even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue . the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job . they proudly called loy  mrs . blandings  in the commercials  introduction . you can imagine though how the no  nonsense parnell handles the situation afterward  when loy leaves him with his paint crew .

1479 ===> i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland . it was a liberal  s fantasy of how the military should be . the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrell  s character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers .  br    br   i kept thinking   hey  there  s a reason why boot camp is tough . it  s supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit . there  s no room for cocky attitudes and men who won  t follow orders .  i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers . i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people  s feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit .  br    br      br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1480 ===> i think i will make a movie next weekend . oh wait  i  m working . . oh i  m sure i can fit it in . it looks like whoever made this film fit it in . i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked    it looks like someones home movie and i don  t think more than     was spent making it    total crap    who let  s this stuff be released        

=======================================================================================================

1481 ===> i  m a male  not given to women  s movies  but this is really a well done special story . i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job  while deniro is his usual superb self . everything is so well done acting  directing  visuals  settings  photography  casting . if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love  this is a winner .  

=======================================================================================================

1482 ===> if you came into the film with expectations  throw them away now  because no amount of hype will do this film justice .  br    br   to categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal . it  s a spy thriller  has elements of noir  bits and pieces of action  science fiction  and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative  mind  bending plot twists  and gorgeous cinematography .  br    br   a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative  both in good and bad ways  of other movies . but as they say  every story cribs from shakespeare  so once you can get past that  you  re in for a hell of a ride .  br    br   you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points  and while the set never becomes unbelievable  there are portions  read the elevator  which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals . don  t misconstrue that to mean it  s on the same level as cheesy sci  fi channel movies  though  because this is on a much higher level .  br    br   if you  re looking for action  you should turn away . this is pure psychology . but if you  re willing to sit down and devote a good   minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience  by all means  do it now  watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it   

=======================================================================================================

1483 ===> words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is . it is a series of random  unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady  really disturbing  . the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco  the best actor in this movie . also  it is rated nc     shunning away the only people that might tolerate it .  

=======================================================================================================

1484 ===> i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru . . . not one laugh in it . ok  maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big  black  bald gay virgin . but the rest of it was shockingly un  funny . on top of being void of any laughs the  skits  go on forever  steer clear of this one if you value your time and money . dreadful    the worst     

=======================================================================================================

1485 ===> director vincenzo natali  s cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which  although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration  manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience .  br    br   morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   a stay  at  home husband with an overbearing wife  decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high  tech company digi corp . his job is to travel to conferences across the country  under the assumed identity of jack thursby  and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses  via a nifty little electronic pen  gizmo .  br    br   in reality  however  the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities . morgan  along with his fellow conference attendees  is being brainwashed . the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma  during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities . once they are totally convinced that they are someone else  they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies  where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion .  br    br   but digi corp  s plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative  for  hire rita foster  lucy liu   who opens morgan  s eyes to what is really happening . she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques . she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby  then he will be  eliminated  . morgan plays along  and applies for a job at rival business sunways .  br    br   however  arriving at his new workplace  he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy . fortunately  the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent .  br    br   from hereon in  things get progressively more complicated the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone . in an exciting finale  all eventually becomes clear  but only if you  ve been following events very carefully  .  br    br   director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget . he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast jeremy northam  in particular  is fantastichis portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection .  br    br   cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects  high rise and necropolis .

1486 ===> listen  i don  t care what anybody says  as cypher is nothing less than a  star movie . cypher is not  i repeat not  a b movie . cypher is an absolute masterpiece . suffice it to say  i am a connoisseur of the world  s finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight . i cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is . cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made . the technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime . in fact  i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me . in fact  i  ve recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie . other critics  of whom some downplayed the movie  have no idea as to what the hell they  re talking about . don  t listen to the haters . and actually  for the most part  reviews of cypher have been largely positive . and it should be noted that cyher is not only a good movie  but it is also a fantastic movie . cypher is the kind of movie that  s so advanced and so magnificently crafted  that it  s over the heads of most critics and all the cynics . there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever . again  the cinematography  the backdrops  the technology  the storyline  and the acting are all     world  class top notch . naturally  i won  t give anything away . this is not a spoiler . and though it is the contention of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters  i believe quite the opposite . cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way . cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves . blade runner       brave new world  total recall  logan  s run  jason bourne and impostor and deja vu . . . look out  cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the aonn multimedia research   star eternal spy movie hall of fame . cypher is counterespionage at it  s absolute best . hands down and hats off . nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction . the future is now .

1487 ===> how do i begin  this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen . it has no redeemable qualities . i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle . it failed to get even a single smile on my face . i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film . i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor . the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack  i  m pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place . i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap . i will leave you with this warning . do not watch this film  it sucks .  

=======================================================================================================

1488 ===> it really impresses me that it got made . the director  writer  actor must be really charismatic in reality . i can think of no other way itd pass script stage . what i want you to consider is this . . . while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors . it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there  not enjoying it  just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying . id really like to know what the budget is  guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor . i want to write  the jokes didn  t appeal to me  . but the reality is for them to appeal to you  you  d have to be the man who wrote them . or a retard . so imagine that in script form . . . and this guy got that green lit . thats impressive isn  t it

1489 ===> this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci  fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali . the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen . the film is superbly shot  i love the cinematography in this  it feels fresh and original . plot  wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall  dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci  fi stuff . morgan sullivan  jeremy northam  is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp  a large technological corporation . he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do . it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen . it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife . after his first job things become strange  his habits change  his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares . he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster  played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu .  he takes an instant attraction to . however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems . he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp . the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies . sullivan  whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain  dead day dream while the speakers drone on  the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages .  suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else . digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence . sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby . digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it  they now effectively control what these spies do  except for sullivan . when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp  make sullivan a double agent . they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down . samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system . the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn . he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him . when a mysterious third party becomes involved  the person it is revealed that foster works for  sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent  who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for . the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires . the cast are great . northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent . he brings a great visual aspect to his performance  his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby . lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact . the rest of the cast are also good .  br    br   director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci  fi flick cube  has a real visual flair . he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look . for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn  t great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively . the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci  fi films  it is up there with them . the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this  that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident . the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along . this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states .      br    br

1490 ===> this filmfour funded sci  fi movie is most definitely a must see . while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise it  s handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive  despite it being basically a re  run of an earlier film . it  s good to know that films like this are still being made  even if they aren  t getting wide releases   and cypher is refreshing for that reason . the plot twists and turns  which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher  s mystery . the plot follows morgan sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons  to him  unknown . however  his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita . . .  br    br   this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it  s apocalyptic imaging of the future . this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type  with it  s only real close affiliate being kubrick  s a clockwork orange . the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish  and more thrilling  plot developing . you never quite know where you are with the plot  which serves in making it all the more intriguing . the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars jeremy northam and lucy lui . northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale  and does well with his role . lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn  t quite fit her talent  but she has a look about her that just fits this movie .  br    br   cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole  if you want an inventive recent sci  fi film cypher is the way to go .  

=======================================================================================================

1491 ===> this film stars  among others   slapchop  vince offer  who also wrote  edited and directed  and joey buttafuoco   not exactly names that scream out  quality  . and with such uplifting skits as  supermodels taking a dump   it  s exactly what it sounds like   a guy who robs a sperm bank  the  rhymer    necrophilia with a rotting corpse  black market fetuses  featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar   lots and lots of gay jokes  a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions . the skits are painfully unfunny  such as  batman and rhymer    the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude . . . and stupid . i truly believe a group of  year  olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget .  br    br   apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by  slap shot  vince against the scientologists . frankly  i wouldn  t know who to root for in this case    apparently  he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film . no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and    unfunny  by comparison  ebola is funnier  . . . and these are the nicest things i can say about the movie .  br    br   by the way  that is bobby lee  from  mad tv   wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film . it  s amazing his career could overcome this .  

=======================================================================================================

1492 ===> lately they have been trying to hock this film late  night on cable tv commercials . don  t believe the hype . i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres . this is  in my opinion  the  rd worst movie of all time  just behind mac  me    worst   and jack frost    worst   but i must admit  they are all close and all terrible  really  nothing of this movie is funny  or disturbing  or anything else it claims to be so don  t waste your money . the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy . i  m not lying about that . someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film . it is that awful . if you don  t believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this  which i doubt you can finish . two thumbs enthusiastically down .  

=======================================================================================================

1493 ===> you  ll notice by the stars i  ve given this great film that  . . . before you see it the first time   is implied . i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week  and last  was a very slow rental experience  not much great coming in  . i  m not sure how this movie slipped past me  i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too . still  it did .  br    br   this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don  t have a large budget . it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark just enough . the entire film is you  the viewer  trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns . i would have given this film       however some of the shots were pretty fake looking . i don  t hold that against this film too much  but i don  t think it deserves a perfect score .  br    br   lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious  as always  . i think she  s pretty underrated as a serious talent . nevermind her beauty  which is difficult   she really takes her roles seriously and doesn  t rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion . and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed  as well .  br    br   jeremy northam does really well  at first  as quite a geeky corporate rat  willing to run through any maze to prove himself . however  as he changes throughout the film  it  s like night and day . i know some fans of clive owen  jude law  or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this  but northam would  could  should fit that bill . he  s suave and cultured . he  s got a great bond posture and voice . i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it  and rather down  to  earth  as well .  br    br   great film and definitely this movie  buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films .  

=======================================================================================================

1494 ===> there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close  ups . it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers . this film also included one of the most imaginative  escape  scenes in recent years . the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller .  br    br   although the plotting of the film was convoluted  the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed .  br    br   in      george orwell suggested in his famous novel       that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state  which would control minds and diminish human liberty . it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film  it was not the state  but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker .  

=======================================================================================================

1495 ===> i rated this movie as awful    . after watching the trailer  i thought this movie could be pretty cool .  guaranteed to offend . . . everyone   the trailer said . well . . . it did offend me  because this movie really sucks . it is hardly a comedy  as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie . and what  s with all the gays in this movie  i  m not gay and i don  t have a problem with those who are  but what  s the point of adding so many gay  scenes in a so called comedy movie  when these scenes are absolutely not funny  i guess the director is a gay man in denial  or something like that .  br    br   so my advice to you is if you want to waste good money  go rent a good comedy you  ve already seen a million times  you  ll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy  s . it really is total crap .  

=======================================================================================================

1496 ===> since most review  s of this film are of screening  s seen decade  s ago i  d like to add a more recent one  the film open  s with stock footage of b     s bombing germany  the film cut  s to oskar werner  s hauptmann  captain  wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitler  s fuehrer bunker  once inside  they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel  the film then cut  s to one of many conference scene  s with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officer  s to  ultimate victory  while werner  s character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen  s are caught up in a fantasy world  some non  bunker event  s are depicted  most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak unit  s and his family  s difficulty in surviving  this film suffer  s from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only   year  s after ww  should not have included the actor portraying goebbels  willy krause  wear  s the same uniform as hitler  including arm eagle  goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband  the  ss  soldier  s wear german army camouflage  the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boy  s of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker  it was done outside in the courtyard  and lastly  hitler  s suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model      most account  s agree it was a walther ppk  some bit  s of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable  this bit is shown as a cabaret skit  with a intoxicated wounded soldier  his arm in a splint  maniacally goose  stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease  belly dance  all by candlelight . . . this is actually embarrassing to watch  the most incredible bit is when werner  s captain wust gain  s an audience alone with skoda  s hitler  hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench  drugged and delirious  when werner  s character begin  s to question him  hitler start  s screaming which bring  s in a ss guard who mortally wound  s werner  s character in the back with a gunshot  this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account  werner  s character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepare  s his own ending  hitler  s farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off  screen  the final second  s of the movie show hitler  s funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar werner  hauptmann wust  this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film  s such as the     remake  hitler the last   day  s  or the german film  downfall   der untergang  if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story  these last two film  s are based on first person eyewitness account  s  with  hitler the last   day  s  being compiled from gerhard boldt  s autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and  downfall  being done from hitler  s secretary  s recollection  s  the screen play for  der letzte akte  is taken from american nuremberg war crime  s trial judge michael musmanno  s book  ten day  s to die   which is more a compilation of event  s  many obviously fanciful  than eyewitness history  it is surprising that hugh trevor roper  s account   the last day  s of hitler  was never made into a film .  

=======================================================================================================

1497 ===> when the matrix appeared in     and questioned existence and identity  it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration . that didn  t really happen  surprisingly  and it took till     for a movie of similar theme to appear . but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit .  br    br   the story is of a morgan sullivan  who applies for a job with a high  flying techno  company called digicorp . his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company  while under an assumed and false identity . his home  life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he  s actually doing . however  things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what  s going on  he starts to question who he actually is . this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up . . .  br    br   twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated  and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable .  br    br   it  s an enthralling journey through a not  too  distant future  and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat .  br    br   highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

1498 ===> a major moneymaker for rko radio  bombardier stars pat o  brien and randolph scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots . o  brien and scott argue over teaching methods  while their students vie for the affections of anne shirley . o  brien  s methods prove sound during a bombing raid over tokyo . scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the japanese  but the mortally wounded scott manages to set fire to a gas truck  providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers . stylistically  bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films  with moments of subtle poignancy  the death of trainee eddie albert  alternating with scenes of ludicrous  yellow peril  melodrama  the japanese literally hiss through their teeth as they torture the helpless americans  . though it can  t help but seem dated today  bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort  the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of robert ryan  who  d actually been appearing before the cameras since     .  br    br   anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film  please contact me at iamaseal  yahoo . com  

=======================================================================================================

1499 ===> a series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day . not as mind  numbingly awful as say  freddy got fingered  or  lost reality   but that in no way is an endorsement in any way  sense or form . features the worst rhyming clown ever . any most if it isn  t offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct . it also has the worst song parody ever put on film  the worst arnold impersonation ever  not just the worst put on film  literally the worst ever  . i have no clue why karen black  micheal clarke duncan  or slash would star in this  the reasons i watched this in the first place  the only thing mildly amusing was dickman . in conclusion i would  t recommend this film to anyone  but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the bottom    on this site are pathetic . do something notable with you lives people . plus if it  s true the church of scientalogy hates him  he can  t be all bad .  br    br   my grade d  

=======================================================================================================

1500 ===> and i repeat  please do not see this movie  this is more than a review . this is a warning . this sets the record for the worst  most effortless comedy ever made . at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays  the gags are crude and flat  but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy  and only   percent of them are right . comedy is hard  this is not some genre any fool can play around with . i think it  s atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to  kentucky fried movie .  basically  these bozos are comparing their so  called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers . come on  i  ve seen pauly shore movies that are   times funnier than  the underground comedy movie .  here  s a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named dkman . the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . that  s it . that  s the whole joke . wow . this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes . another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . and in another sketch  there  s a bag lady beauty contest  in which we  re exposed to the horrible sights of bikini  clad middle  aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . plus  making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . it  s a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . the whole movie is supposed to be a satire . i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire . . . is truth    for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap  explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags  some of the sketches might  ve sounded funny on paper  but anybody who  s taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper  it probably won  t be funny on screen . if i tell someone about a big  black  muscular gay virgin  who  s saving himself for the right man  he or she would probably laugh . but watching the premise played out on screen for about   minutes is a complete drag . i hate how whenever people criticize a low  brow comedy like this for not being funny  they  re regarded as stuck  up squares . i just saw  white chicks  recently . that  s another low  brow  politically incorrect comedy  but i laughed my head off . the most offensive thing about  the underground comedy movie  is it  s not funny  what the writers and directors don  t understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn  t work . there has to be more  just think of the famous scene from  there  s something about mary   ironically  enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list  . the joke about the semen wasn  t just funny because it involved bodily fluids . there was a buildup . ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn  t go out on a date with a  loaded gun .  then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . a knock is on the door  and he has to answer it . his date  mary  is at the door and that  s when it  s revealed that the semen is hanging off ben  s ear . in this movie  there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people  with no buildup whatsoever . as jay leno always says   this comedy thing  s not so easy  is it   keep that in mind  vince offer   cause you weren  t cut out for this genre   the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . let  s face it  nowadays it  s hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . i know comedy is subjective . . . but this movie shouldn  t be funny to anybody  except maybe the filmmakers themselves . as a side note  the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan  s fame in movies like  armageddon  and  the green mile .  there can  t be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . all the others in the cast are either non  actors  has  been actors or b  movie stars . karen black made a good impression in  five easy pieces   but i don  t think she  s done anything of value ever since . slash was probably drugged into being in this film . gina lee nolin is nothing without  baywatch .  angelyne is the film  s biggest star  keeping in mind duncan wasn  t famous at the time   and there are still probably a ton of people who haven  t heard of her   for good reason . usually  i  m in support of extremely low  budget flicks  but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . i hope to lord this doesn  t become a cult classic  shouldn  t there be a law against distributing crap like this

1501 ===> there were a lot of films made by hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public . seen today  some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda   which they technically are  but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation . this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre   having a pretty realistic script and good production values . pat o  brien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other films  you know  the tough  talking  hard  driven but  swell guy   . randolph scott is  as always  competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent  look for a young robert ryan as one of the bombardiers in training  . while the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews  the film is well  crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far  fetched . that it  perhaps  except for the very end   where the film is a bit over  the  top but also very satisfying . about the only serious negative  and this is mostly for nitpickers  is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and  nuts  like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this   all others probably won  t notice .  

=======================================================================================================

1502 ===> i enjoyed watching cliffhanger  at the beginning when that woman  sarah  was full of terror when she was slipping  i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see  your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster . i did like watching cliffhanger  i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he  ll be known as playing rambo and rocky .  

=======================================================================================================

1503 ===> this is the worst movie i  ve ever seen in my life . this is saying quite a bit  considering some of the choices i  ve made in film rentals .  br    br   i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it . the topless scene lasted all of about  seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender .  br    br   the  skits  are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker  room gags  and it  s such a blatant  and poor  rip  off of the kentucky fried movie that you  ll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of  vince offer   whoever that is  .  br    br   unless you are a masochist  avoid this pile of rubbish .

1504 ===> i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago  and said to myself   seems funny  plus it has michael clarke duncan  how can i lose   i proceeded to pay    .   plus tax for it . i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted . wooden performances abound . all the  hilarious  and  outstanding  performances promised never seemed to arrive . after   minutes i hung my head in shame  knowing that i could never get that   minutes or    .   back . i literally almost cried as well  because if that was what could be considered  comedy  i didn  t want to believe in movies anymore . my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was . over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn  t want to watch it alone . this was my next horrible mistake  because as i watched i just became angry . i began to yell at the movie  and i  m not one to talk to movies period . everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they  ve ever seen . my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends  but that could not save this movie even . the fact that this movie is not on the bottom    list on imdb is astounding . the fact that its rating  at the time of this writing  is  .  is a crime against humanity .  

=======================================================================================================

1505 ===> good action show  but nothing new . this one took place high in the mountains  which showed some nice scenery and such . one man takes on a group of mercenaries  the lead flies  and he kicks butt . it could have been called  rambo goes to the rockies   it was that pat . it did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror . not a bad picture  but just same ol   same ol  .  

=======================================================================================================

1506 ===> this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded . this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights  a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well  an exciting plot  and a great performance from it  s main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways . the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play . the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human  much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters . they chose to humanise stallone  s character in this one which is ok but considering the plot  s style  weakens the excitement factor . also  the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times . the script should have been more realistic and less  talky  . another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes . the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses . they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie . instead  they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences  ala  a  team  tv series  as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops . this movie had a lot of all time great potential . crisper action sequences  better dialogue and more rambo  rocky style emotion  determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level . i know this was not stallone  s fault . i sense the movie  s director wanted to tone down stallone  s character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer . sill a good movie though . . . . . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1507 ===> a woman  s nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive . the cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement . of course b  horror movie queen brinke stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature . the only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with delia sheppard . and the last twenty minutes of brinke  s bloody rampage are quite fun to watch . the special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful . better watch  scalps  or  alien dead  again . of course i ain  t expecting classy entertainment from fred olen ray  but  haunting fear  is too dull to be enjoyable .  

=======================================================================================================

1508 ===> i purchased this video quite cheaply ex  rental  thinking that the cover looked quite nice . and it was nice  but the movie is trash . i can handle b  grade  i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp  ie .  surf nazis must die  is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be   but this was just bland bland bland . incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences . this movie has very little to offer .  

=======================================================================================================

1509 ===> cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone  s last action movie before he became such an underrated actor . it  s about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over    million dollars . it has great action sequence  s  edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies .  

=======================================================================================================

1510 ===> while the prices have gone up a lot  and some of the details have become dated  any homeowner who  s struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie . i know i did .  br    br   mr . blandings  a new york ad executive  decides to move his family to the connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there . he gets into one hilarious jam after another  from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties  as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control . i thought that the funniest scenes were where blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water . they dig down hundreds of feet  but never find water . yet only a short distance away  a few days later  the basement of his house  to  be floods   br    br   cary grant and myrna loy give believable performances as the harried blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined  and melvyn douglas is even better as blanding  s lawyer and family friend .  br    br   the only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since     . mrs . blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she  s causing  and there  s a black maid  horrors   . so don  t watch this movie through the social lens of      and you  ll enjoy it all the more .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1511 ===> this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie . this installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke  but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny .  br    br   there  s almost a half  hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert  and lots of people watching on  free tv    since when does that happen   surely the script writer could have done something more creative look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation . not in this film  which pretty much ended the bill  ted franchise . the joke was over .  br    br   the grim reaper is tossed into the mix  for whatever reason . this infusion  like the whole plot  is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement . there  s a zz top impression  hammered in for no reason . there  s lights  smoke  mirrors  noise . but nothing really creative or funny .  br    br   skip this bogus thing .  

=======================================================================================================

1512 ===> first off . . . with names like fred olen ray  brinke stevens and jan  michael vincent  plus distributors like  rhino  and  troma  on the video box  you know what you  re getting into with this one . b movie mania  if you  re actually expecting to see a thriller  based on edgar allan poe   then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman   s poe films . this is pure  unadulterated sleaze  with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to  the premature burial    complete with lots of r  rated  ready  for  video sex and nudity . however  it  s certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way . . .  br    br   brinke  who has three nude scenes in the first   minutes  plays rich  traumatized  insomniac housewife victoria monroe  whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father  hoke howell  . her worthless husband terry  jay richardson  has racked up some serious gambling debt  owed to a gangster played by robert quarry  and  with help from his kinky  blonde  european  accented sexpot secretary lisa  delia sheppard  plots to do away with brinke for her money . name  value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist  she  s way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this     s sci  fi  horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still  living vicki . jan  michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo  goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home .  br    br   the kill  a  spouse  for  the  inheritance plot has been done a million times before  the ending is an unintentional laugh riot  concluding with a direct rip  off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror  and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit . brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic  but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role . she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here .  

=======================================================================================================

1513 ===> after the success of die hard and it  s sequels it  s no surprise really that in the     s  a glut of  die hard on a . . . . .  movies cashed in on the wrong guy  wrong place  wrong time concept . that is what they did with cliffhanger  die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly  stop or my mom will shoot  stallone  s career .  br    br   cliffhanger is one big nit  pickers dream  especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing  base  jumping  aviation  facial expressions  acting skills . all in all it  s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk . stallone even managed to get out  acted by a horse  however  if you an forget all the nonsense  it  s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills  and unintentionally  plenty of laughs .  br    br   you  ve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness  his tick every box band of baddies  and best of all  the permanently harassed and hapless  turncoat  agent  rex linn as travers .  br    br   he may of been henry in  portrait of a serial killer  but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe  worthy performance as hal  he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors  that man never hurt anybody  and whilst he surely can  t be  it really does look like ralph waite  s frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death .  br    br   mention too must go to former  london  s burning  actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy  who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football  yes  you can  t help enjoy that bit  hal needed a good kicking .  br    br   so forget your better judgement  who cares if  that could never happen   lower your acting expectations  turn up the volume and enjoy  and if you  re looking for qaulen  he  s the one wearing the helicopter .  

=======================================================================================================

1514 ===> forget credibility  br    br   you must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats  being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed  and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons . . . especially when renny harlin is directing .  br    br    cliffhanger  is no exception . but the movie has numerous assets  breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed  stunning special and visual effects  the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film   excellent musical score  welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension  and a solid cast  two heroes  stallone  star and cowriter  has the lion  s share of the footage  but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground   a charming heroin  janine turner   and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever  priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall  but also rex linn  in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it  leon  craig fairbrass  good  solid entertainment then  if no credibility . as roger ebert wrote  about another film   it  s the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don  t make the mistake of thinking too much .   br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1515 ===> in its way  mister foe  originally  and more appropriately  titled hallam foe  i can  t see addressing its title character as  mister    is a tribute to good acting . both jamie bell  as hallam  a physically attractive voyeur  creep  and sophia myles  as kate  his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance  are convincing . the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life . a young man who spies on the intimate details of people  s lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp . and a woman in kate  s situation would be repulsed and frightened  she would probably call the police .  br    br   these things are not  however  what happens in the movie . poor hallam  s mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he  s been having an affair . hallam  of course  hates his stepmother and lets he know it . she has sex with him . kate  s some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games . she looks like his birth mother . it all ends happily with hallam  resolving  his  issues  .  br    br   forty some years ago  the play and brilliantly acted movie  who  s afraid of virginia woolf  had a similarly optimistic ending  with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart . the trouble is  it doesn  t always work that way  especially when nobody really cares . in virginia woolf  the ending  s plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation . in mister foe  the emotional revelation never really happens .  

=======================================================================================================

1516 ===> david mackenzie  s follow  up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel  good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho  sexual issues with his dead mother . it wants to be gritty  realistic  and mysterious . at the same time  it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult .  br    br   to meet this end  the film tries hard to be youthful . its poster has hand  drawn letters looking like that of juno . its original soundtrack is comprised of fast  paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok just a little misguided . but strangely the film is anything but youthful .  br    br   like young adam this film  s central mystery concerns a drowned woman  in this case hallam  s mother . young adam keeps its mystery quiet  contemplative  and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come . hallam foe does the opposite . it foregrounds its character  s psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters . the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend . hallam swiftly interrupts  asserting his presence in the household . here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the movie .  br    br   the mystery surrounding his mother  s drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father  s girlfriend . the audience can never really trust hallam because  besides being creepy  we think his obsession has led him close to insanity . this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable . right when he  s found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home  at first it appearing to be looking for the police . then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother  which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element .  br    br   while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character  he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs . this movie is in no way mysterious  yet it is not blunt either . it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues  but it adds a very self  conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite . it goes for a soundtrack  heavy  trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings  picks locks  and camps out for the sake of voyeurism . these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward  drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy  giddy  or pleasant . they are more neutral than anything not propelling the character or story . mackenzie makes you understand hallam  yet he fails to build common ground .  br    br   he expects you to enjoy hallam  s trials and tribulations without much ideological justification . the film hinges on its audience  s perspective on voyeurism  the kind of person who engages in it . obviously  most people would be disgusted by it . and hallam foe realizes that  but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions . he goes from person to person  trying to fill his deep void . there is a particularly disturbing line from hallam  s love interest kate where she drunkenly says  i love creepy boys   perhaps asking the audience to do the same . the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him  her motivation remains vague throughout  and tries to further us from judging him . it  s not hard to like hallam  but it is very hard to participate in his adventure  if it is even an adventure at all . all the while  the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood .  br    br   great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act  muddy development  and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie . recently this film was re  named for a us release  and for what reason  not only is it more unappealing  but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title  mister .   

=======================================================================================================

1517 ===> this movie is just great . it  s entertaining from beginning to the end  you  re always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie . in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics .  br    br   sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain  rescue guy gabe walker . together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker . and then  john lithgow  one of the best performances i  ve seen of him as a villain .  br    br   and the fact that    of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action   br    br   brilliant movie   

=======================================================================================================

1518 ===> cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director renny harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains . sylvester stallone is impressive as gabe walker the expert climber especially in the action  fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic . for the sake of the film though i willing to suspend my disbelief . the rest of the cast including john lithgow  michael rooker  janine turner  rex linn  caroline goodall  and leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie . the action  fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren  t very realistic no matter how tough you are . the climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie . the deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable . the villains are solid but it would  ve been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them . the pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one . if you  re a big fan of harlins or stallone  s than chances are you  ll enjoy this one too . overall cliffhanger has character development with enough action  drama  some suspense  excitement  thrills  and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch .  

=======================================================================================================

1519 ===> once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing . i just recently reviewed baby face nelson . now i  ve seen dillinger and i  ve had it .  br    br   this movie is garbage . i don  t know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde . this movie is far from a classic . someone called it brilliant . that  s an insane thing to say . this movie can  t get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i  ve ever seen . i don  t know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger . first of all he looks nothing like him . second of all  by the time john dillinger was killed he was   . when oates made this he was    you could even tell that he  s older than the real dillinger just by looking at him . not only was he too old  but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis .  br    br   they show baby face nelson die  then homer van meter  and finally john dillinger . john dillinger was killed before both of them . the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson . not only do the writers not know when they died  but they also don  t know how they died . baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe . homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns . homer van meter was cornered by the police in st . paul and gunned down with machine guns . another member of dillinger  s gang  harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie . pierpont wasn  t shot . harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair . i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i  m not going to go into it again here . let me also add that richard dreyfuss  portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic . there  s a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating . while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming   leave me alone   baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought . maybe dillinger didn  t agree with nelson  s bank robbing methods  but they never fought . nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten . they keep calling him lester  baby face  nelson . he was never in his life known by that name . nelson  s real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson . the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood  but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood . john milius doesn  t know anything . where the hell did john milius get his information  i could probably make a better movie than him .  br    br   finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable . the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette . by the way  billie frechette wasn  t even there that night . but a girl named polly hamilton was . melvin purvis yells   johnny   dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell . it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night . the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away . they didn  t even have to shoot him . they were so close that powder burns were found on his face . it was murder . they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger . after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man  the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger  s death . i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn  t john dillinger  but i  ll stop here . if you would like to know more check it out here  br    br   see the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want  but don  t waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1520 ===> i just finished reading a book about dillinger . this movie was horribly inaccurate . it  s like they got a list of names and just made everything up . his robberies and getaways were well planned  down to the second  when the time was up  they left whether they had all of the money or not . they had notes of every road  where to turn  etc . purvis never saw him at the restaurant  he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left . purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed  only photos of him . the way his gang members died were fictitious . dillinger never robbed a bank by himself  like he did in this movie . if i had never read the book  maybe i could have enjoyed the movie . the acting was a bit over the top in places . the action was overdone as well . on second thought  i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn  t read the book .  

=======================================================================================================

1521 ===> since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite . since then i  ve seen it countless times and i never get tired of it . the setting has a lot to do with it  the colorado i know would be jealous   but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes . there has not been a movie i can compare this too . john lithgow plays a smart villain  but i love how he is completely out of his element   he has to follow tucker around and that  s what keeps it interesting . this is an action movie at it  s best . i don  t think i  ll see another that is so entertaining .  br    br   you don  t need       rounds fired to qualify as an action movie . it just has to keep you captivated  not shell  shocked .  

=======================================================================================================

1522 ===> to be honest  i didn  t like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time . but i guess the trouble is that i haven  t seen it in a theater . big mistake  because the   thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and   is the cinematography . try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system . the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level  and a commercial potential  . the more i see it  the more i like it .  br    br   it  s definitely one of renny harlin  s best movie . this guy knows about action . die hard   the long kiss good bye  etc . and it  s particularly good in this movie . the special effect are great and spectacular . stallone really needed that movie get back with success . still good to see him

1523 ===> near the beginning  after it  s been established that outlaw john dillinger  warren oates   is an egomaniacal rapist  another bandit of the     s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the fbi . second  in  command melvin purvis  ben johnson   surveys the situations  sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth  picks up two loaded .    caliber automatics  and stalks off into the distant house alone . bang  bang  bang . purvis emerges alone from the house  carrying the female hostage  the miscreant dead . all in long shot .  br    br   if you  re enthralled by stories like red riding hood  this should have considerable appeal .  br    br   oh  it  s as exciting as it is mindless . pretty boy floyd meets his demise dramatically . multiple violations of the civic code . plenty of shoot outs with tommy guns and pistols . blood all over .  br    br   as history  it stinks . few remember melvin purvis as an fbi hero  partly  i would guess  because of his name . melvin purvis  we all remember j . edgar hoover  who fired melvin purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though .  br    br   the picture was written and directed by john milius . he  s the guy who had it written into his contract that  should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions  he should be the designated shooter . milius is the guy  a compleat gun freak  who had teddy roosevelt  s rough riders in the spanish  american war shouting quotations from henry v    saint crispin  s day  and all that .  br    br   exciting  yes  and complete garbage .  i knew i  d never take him alive  and i didn  t try too hard neither .  that is  kill  em all and let god sort them out .  br    br   you  ll just love it .

1524 ===> anyone who visited drive  ins in the     s    s  and   s  must have seen a film or two by american international pictures  a distributor that resembled     s giant cannon films . wherever movie  goers ventured  aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles  in the   s came horror movies like  voodoo woman  and  the undead  in the   s were frankie avalon  annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like  the glory stompers  and into the   s  aip churned out grindhouse  level trash like  cannibal girls  and  sugar hill .   br    br    dillinger   released in      is one of the more  highbrow  aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive  in film  making it is one of those uneven  over  the  top flicks that satisfied the masses  thirst for entertainment  craftsmanship and common sense be damned . on the whole   dillinger  is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours  but certainly not memorable . heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact   dillinger  was a fair effort by screenwriter  director john milius   magnum force   but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career .  br    br   the     minute  dillinger   epic for aip  s scope  follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis  played by academy award winner ben johnson . purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a     kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice . at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout  including expert bankrobber john dillinger  warren oates   pretty boy floyd  steve kanaly   and psychopath baby face nelson  richard dreyfuss  . dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson  taking along homer van meter  harry dean stanton  and harry pierpont  geoffrey lewis  . he also hooked up with billie frechette  michelle phillips   a prostitute of french and indian extraction . while taking place over several months in         dillinger  is basically a chase film  with purvis  s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j . edgar hoover .  br    br    dillinger  has a documentary feel  listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis . milius keeps an honest depression look  using authentic fashion  cars  weapons  and buildings he also sprinkles around black  and  white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts . the film is never boring  moving at a quick  if haphazard  pace . the action scenes are dillinger  s strongpoint  edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort . thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film  not to mention pounds of explosives . this film is certainly not for the squeamish  with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place . the violence  while gratuitous  brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life .  br    br   this film never transcends its exploitation status  however  because the needed writing just isn  t there . john milius  somewhat overrated as a filmmaker  places way too much emphasis on action . the action scenes  mostly blood  filled shootouts  are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era  including      s  bonnie and clyde .  but we simply don  t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon  with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward . melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline  becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling . all too often  the film takes on a shoot   em  up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail .  br    br   aside from this  the picture  s main crime is ignorance of historical fact . while many say that  dillinger  is just a film  it  s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent . those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die  as milius  s screenplay and the film  s documentary style encourage us to believe . in fact  dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death  nor did he have billie frechette in tow . while these inaccuracies might make for high drama  there is no reason why milius couldn  t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them .  br    br   warren oates  s performance as dillinger is quite good  although he sometimes looks unconvincing . oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger  than  life image in the american press however  we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime . ben johnson gives some life to purvis  suave but rather flat . michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it  s really too bad that milius  s screenplay didn  t flesh out her relationship with dillinger . we never learn what drew her to a cold  blooded killer  other than the stereotype of an easy  going girl who is attracted to men of danger . the supporting roles with kanaly  dreyfuss  stanton  lewis  and a briefly  appearing cloris leachman  are acceptable for such talent .  br    br   as a piece of     s exploitation   dillinger  appears doomed to retail bargain bins  which is exactly where i picked up mgm  s dvd release for   .   . the film is nicely presented in widescreen  a must for drive  in flicks  with subtitles in french and spanish . dillinger  s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra . largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive  in enthusiasts  the film doesn  t really call for much else in way of supplementary material . for fans of the genre  it  s certainly worth checking out .  br    br    out of   br    br   roving reviewer  www . geocities . com  paul  johnr

1526 ===> watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early    s  a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as  die hard in a  on a .  cliffhanger is  die hard on a mountain   and pretty good  for what it is .  br    br   but unlike passenger   and under siege  which are decent die hard clones on their own terms  cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that  in their immensity  threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks .  br    br   years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations  cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings .  br    br   the opening sequence has already received substantial praise  all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening . not even harlin  s shot of the falling stuffed animal  which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke  and which he repeated in deep blue sea   or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite  s face  can dim the sequence  s power .  br    br   the next impressive set  piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet . as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin  the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody double  crosses are completely unexpected . as roger ebert has observed  the stuntman who made the mid  air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition .  br    br   later  during the avalanche sequence  one of the terrorists  thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain . so far as i know  no one was killed in the making of this movie  a small miracle  considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts   so obviously a dummy was used for the shot . but the shot itself remains impressive because we  re left wondering how harlin  or more likely one of the second  unit directors  knew exactly where to place the camera .  br    br   i  ll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week  because he  s one of the few movie stars i  ve ever seen who  s completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain  and at the same time actually feels that pain . the role of gabe walker really complements stallone  s acting strengths he plays an older  more vulnerable kind of action hero  giving an impressively low  key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself .  br    br   in contrast to many of today  s post  matrix  comic book  inspired action heroes  stallone  s walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer  enhanced abilities . in cliffhanger  the hero almost freezes to death  and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another . he winces when he  s hit and bleeds when he  s cut  particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky  style pummeling from one of the mad  dog villains .  br    br   it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie  s effectiveness when i first saw this movie as a teenager  i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust  or rather  the ice   at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold  blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise .  br    br   lithgow  s british accent is as unconvincing as the movie  s occasional model plane or model helicopter  but he  s fundamentally a good actor  and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene  looking at his hostages stallone and rooker  trying to decide which tasks to give them  he actually says  you  stay  you  fetch   even a better actor  such as anthony hopkins  might have had trouble with that line .  br    br   even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside  it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show .  br    br   early in the movie  for example  lithgow openly says to one of his men  retire stallone when he comes down .  no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face  and this precipitates a gripping tug  of  war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg .  br    br   lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means  but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn  t given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor .  br    br   done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or  at times  a western  cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film .  br    br   besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before  the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow  as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action  packed narrative . finally  harlin  s decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless  since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes .  br    br   it  s a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies  because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later . but perhaps it  s best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time  without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already . there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit compared to that clinker  cliffhanger belongs on the imdb  s top    list .  br    br   rating   very good  especially considering most of stallone  s other movies .

1527 ===> i recently watched this film at the    th gothenburg film festival  and to be honest it was on of the worst films i  ve ever had the misfortune to watch . don  t get me wrong  there are the funny and entertaining bad films  e . g  manos  hands of fate   and then there are the awful bad films .  this one falls into the latter category  . the cinematography was unbelievable  and not in a good way . it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus  with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot   the lighting was something between  one guy running around with a light bulb  and  non existing  . the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors  and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them . the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer  a classic look a la jason vorhees from  friday the    th  . the plot was extremely poor  and the ending even worse . i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like  or maybe an insomniac needing sleep .  

=======================================================================================================

1528 ===> it  s interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film . but the problem is that it  s not very good . there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented  the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn  t bother for any of them .  br    br   rather bland  and sometimes downright bad  photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can  t expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it . it  s unfair to review the film and compare it to other high  budget films . but alas  that is what one must do . on its own  it  s not very good . and compared to others  it  s still not very good . but it is not without its good points  i liked the plot . it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end . sometimes in the really dark scenes  it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well .  br    br   however in the end the film fails to impress . the characters are pretty much non  existent and we don  t care for any of them . any of them might die  but it  s possible to pinpoint the final  survivor  from very early on .

1529 ===> wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge  an ace mountain rescue climber gabriel walker  stallone  comes back for his girlfriend jessie  janine turner   while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening  a spectacularly precarious mid  air hijacking goes wrong and     million taken from a treasury department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing  br    br   stranded off the snowy peaks  and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash  the high  trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit  br    br   unfortunately  gab and hall  michael rooker  have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake  and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic  john lithgow   are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money  br    br   with breathtaking shots  vertiginous scenery  dizzying heights  perilous climbs  freezing temperatures   cliffhanger  is definitely stallone  s best action adventure movie  

=======================================================================================================

1530 ===> i don  t think i  ll ever understand the hate for renny harlin .  die hard   was cool  and he gave the world  cliffhanger   one of the most awesome action movies ever . that  s right  you little punks   cliffhanger  rules  and we all know it .  br    br   sly plays gabe walker  a former rescue climber who is  just visiting  his old town when he is asked to help a former friend  hal tucker  michael rooker   assist in a rescue on a mountain peak . walker obviously came back at a convenient time  because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen  john lithgow  . qualen  co . have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u . s . government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back . . .  br    br   essentially   cliffhanger  is another  die hard  clone . just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains  complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal . naturally  that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough  as stallone  s character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease  and slams face  first into several rock faces with no apparent side  effects . after all  isn  t that what action movies are all about   br    br    cliffhanger  is one of the most exciting action movies around . a showcase of great scenes and stunts . one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i  ve ever seen in a movie  and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning  it maintains its action awesomeness . john lithgow  s lead villain is entertaining  and one bad dude . quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever .  br    br    cliffhanger  is easily one of stallone  s best efforts  definitely renny harlin  s best effort  and a very exciting action movie

1535 ===> it must be the most corniest tv show on the air . this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies . his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother . i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use . jim has got to retire or something . please let them go of the air . if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush . id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing . i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running . we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see jim  s face . in conclusion  no more please .

1536 ===> i love the episode where jim becomes the greenman . it is great  when jim tosses that little person through the window  the look on his face is priceless . then when he starts to address the priest in his wife  s behalf only to find out that she has become the pee  woman  great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see . i am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode . i  d like to use it as my avatar on a message board because i think the greenman is hilarious . does anyone know where i can download a photo of jim as the greenman  can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo   

=======================================================================================================

1537 ===> i was hooked from beginning to end . great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump  but to make you go  what the fck did i just see   all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about  so i won  t rehash what has already been said . i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me . i even had a bad dream after seeing it  and i am a true horror fan  not easily spooked by tripe like  the grudge  or even  silent hill  . what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys . what would my personal horror be  my subconscious took me there  and it was not pleasant . that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you  the best part of this movie is that it is subtle . it  s not about bogeymen that jump out at you  alien invasions  or tons of gore . it  s the opposite . the horror you create in your own mind . the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it  s power over them . simply  the men ask for the one thing they desire  and they get it . . . but not in the way they imagined . so on the one hand  they get what they wish for from an occult book  but may ultimately wish they hadn  t . sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be   

=======================================================================================================

1538 ===> now this is what i  d call a good horror . with occult  supernatural undertones  this nice low  budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene . this proves you don  t need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie .  br    br   the plot revolves around  cellmates in a prison  and each of these characters  and their motives  become gradually more interesting  as the movie builds up tension to the finale . most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere  who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these  other inmates .  br    br   i won  t say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen . there a few flaws though the fx are not that good  but they  re used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end  but malefique redeems itself by the time it  s over .  br    br   i thought his was a very good movie       

=======================================================================================================

1539 ===> all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father  a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish . how can that be funny  of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed  but jim  s character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner .  br    br   and why it that  my guess is that it  s because  he should now better  . jim  s not a stupid guy  he can take care of things and he  s got the opportunities to do so . but he chooses not to . it  s a conscious choice he makes  when he chooses to not play with his kids  not go shopping because he doesn  t want to buy  lady products  and it  s a choice he makes  when he puts down his relatives .  br    br   the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to . if the cheryl character was a real person  she would have left him years ago  and not stay with the deadbeat for  years . but alas  she  s just a catalyst for jim  s quirky middle  class extreme selfishness .  

=======================================================================================================

1540 ===> as a young black  latina woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me . of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it unfortunately  i didn  t . although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant  the story was simply not properly developed . the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film . had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes  perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more . honestly  i would recommend a film like  raising victor  over this one any day . i just was not too impressed .  

=======================================================================================================

1541 ===> watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it . the whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison   years earlier  somehow without leaving his cell . as they look through the diary  they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom . what they find out  is something completely different  and horrifying to say the least . i like low  budget horror films  that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way  and tell a good story . this movie does just that  despite taking a while to get going . the result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me  and i enjoyed the ride . not a lot of gore  but that wouldn  t fit the story  although the gore it has is pretty good .  

=======================================================================================================

1542 ===> this film centers on four criminals  locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell  hoping that a mysterious book of black magic  penned by a former inmate around      named danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young .  br    br   carrre  s  grald laroche  criminal business tactics  shortcuts  have landed him in prison with three oddball cell  mates . . a transsexual brute marcus  clovis cornillac   marcus  love  toy pquerette  dimitri rataud  who eats objects he touches  . . and is in prison for eating his six  month old sister  and obeys his charge as if  he  were his mother  and the scholarly lassalle  philippe laudenbach  who doesn  t read  or eat breakfast  . . the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day  . the film follows carrre as he reads from the book  attempting to understand it  s meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison . carrre loves his child  and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail . when she betrays him  carrre begins to slowly seethe with hate  and longing to see and hold his beloved son . carrre  s toughest critic is marcus  who longs to be fully female  while still folding to several masculine traits  such as working out and taking a leak standing up . he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic  although deep inside is a world of vulnerability . pquerette is completely under marcus  control and behaves like a canine to it  s master . . there  s even an alarming scene where pquerette breast  feeds from marcus  lassalle is an unraveling mystery  opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain . clearly intellectual  and holding possible secrets from the others  lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going . soon  those who aren  t a threat to the book seek their  true  escape  not as much from the cell of four walls  but the cell that imprisons their true desires . after a certain murder  the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant . . who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away  and better yet  how to use it  a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach .  br    br   i  m glad i had a chance to watch this film . it does play out like  monkey  s paw   the characters get what they desire  but a price must be met . there  s gore in the film  startling moments of graphic violence  but  in my opinion  this is first and foremost a story  driven tale . the gore is a product of what the book unleashes . one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air  while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man  s desire . we see danver  s fate at the end  with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away . lassalle  s fate is a masterful effects sequence . i will say that malfique  through eric valette  s well paced direction  always kept my attention  and  for being such an isolated movie  . . about    of the film takes place in a singular location  the prison cell  it never seems to drag . i guess that  s a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations  not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them .

1543 ===> the show is average . it doesn  t make me laugh particularly . however  i think courtney really brings it down . she doesn  t look natural . she has these three ways to talk  all robotic . she talks quietly  with no intonation   she talks normally  with no intonation   or she does that thing where she starts talking normally  and starts yelling gradually . however  her yelling is like  let  s pretend i  m yelling because i shouldn  t be too loud on the set  .  br    br   she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing . it  s annoying . you can  t really get her personality  because she doesn  t really produce emotion  and doesn  t get upset . she has this husband  who  s doing all these stupid things  and there is no reaction from her . very dry and plain acting .  

=======================================================================================================

1544 ===> i wish i could say that this show was unusual in it  s banality  but it is usual in every way . it has the dumb husband  his smarter but boring and conventional wife  along with the idiotic sidekick for  comic  relief  it sorely needs it . stale predictable jokes  with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack  punctuate this noxious mental narcotic  s nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill  or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma . but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly identify . a  regular  guy just like you and me . i live in the southern u . s  so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism . down here  that obnoxious character is everywhere  in some form or another . seeing him on television is brutal overkill .

1545 ===> malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere . nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around  characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest . soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell . from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison . that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light .  br    br   honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together . anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast . the kills are raw and eerie . . . its doesn  t take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser . malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint . at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger . . . when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal  so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be  with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do . i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale . several elements like the visitor with the camera  the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don  t fit tight in the story . anyway  i  ll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette  although its a turn  off to see he  s is doing a hollywood remake of  one missed call  which was worn off and useless already in the miike  version .

1546 ===> good horror movies from france are quite rare  and it  s fairly easy to see why  whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film  he emigrates towards glorious hollywood immediately after to directed the big  budgeted remake of another great film classic  how can france possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy  directors leave the country after just one film   haute tension  was a fantastic movie and it earned director alexandre aja a  one  way   ticket to the states to remake  the hills have eyes   which he did terrifically  i may add  . eric valette  s long  feature debut  malfique  was a very promising and engaging horror picture too  and he  s already off to the hollywood as well to direct the remake of takashi miike  s ghost  story hit  one missed call  . so there you have it  two very gifted frenchmen that aren  t likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon .  malfique  is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start  but once the plot properly develops  it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects . the film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters . we  re inside a ramshackle french prison cell with four occupants . the new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud  the elderly and  wise  inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there  s a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome . they find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell  belonging to a sick murderer in the      s who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape . the four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book  only to realize the occult is something you shouldn  t mess with eric valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists  which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots  but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of wishmaster  device .  malfique  is a dark film  with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior . watch it before some wealthy american production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals .

1547 ===> shown in australia as  hydrosphere   this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end  just to see if it could get any worse . . . and it does  the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class  the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures  and the acting is wooden .  br    br   the infant  muppet  seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of  total recall  . there didn  t seem to be a single  original idea in the whole movie .  br    br   i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through .  br    br   malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame . he obviously needed the money   

=======================================================================================================

1548 ===> this movie is absolutely pointless  one of the good esamples how malcom mcdowall never got one decent role after clockwork orange . this one may be one of the worst though . no story  crappy special effects  shot in     or even worse cropped on dvd  just avoid it . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1549 ===> malfique is a very interesting movie . it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures . the central concept is great  three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth  who the audience identify with  and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell .  br    br   the atmosphere is well  woven  it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes  in the chteau d  if  prior to becoming the count of monte cristo  . the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell  particularly the character we are meant to identify with  carrre  a white  collar criminal whose crime is not specified  but it  s obliquely suggested might be fraud  . on one occasion carrre dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him we never leave the cell  the claustrophobia is unbroken . there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell  and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall . so even though the film appears to be very modern  it has a very old world feel of incarceration .  br    br   the characters are intriguing . we have marcus  a violent pre  op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pquerette  french for daisy  a heavily retarded young man . pquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful  and unfortunately this included his baby sister  hence his current predicament  i like this comment on internalisation  very primitive  . lasalle is a withdrawn  possessed elderly man  in for brutally murdering his wife .  br    br   the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you  and there  s a ritual that goes with that . i think that  s what disturbs me the most  seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically . it has a real life ring to it . the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well  every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong . i  m actually hearing the gong now every time i do something self  destructive .  br    br   i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don  t really reinforce the message consistently  particularly with carrre  also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film  not in terms of a successive revelation either . i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish  more by design than execution  such as the famous  vagina eye   and the sodomy of lasalle  for me  totally hollow images .  br    br   at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with  and some things don  t seem logical  for example we  ve been clumsily led to believe different things about carrre  s child . this doesn  t change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird  a  pure  horror movie . there is no comedic dross or genre segueing  like cube       natali   the obvious movie to compare it to  it  s a total immersion experience  where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters . this last comment i make about it being a  pure  experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point .  br    br   on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian . he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him . the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge . this prompts lasalle to go insane . that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge . it  s something i myself have felt .  br    br   one final comment is that two of the quite well  received comments on the board have confused the characters  names . to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character  simply click on philippe laudenbach  s page and you will see he was born in     .  

=======================================================================================================

1550 ===> i  d waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england  but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it . there are a lot of great things to the film  for a start the acting . its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work . this and the constantly gripping and interesting script  with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it  give the film a real solid backbone . add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner . it has my favorite kind of gore too  supernatural and splattery . also  the characters of marcus  the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy  his mentally retarded lover  plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times  and give a far out  anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones . this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies  far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce . my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone  but it still works  so on the whole i  d really recommend this to serious horror buffs .  

=======================================================================================================

1551 ===> there are two reasons why i did not give a  to this movie . one reason are some of the actors  like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh  work  who tried to play at their usually good level of acting . however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting .  br    br   the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg  which is quite different to most other such roles i  ve seen so far .  br    br   everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be . boring scenes  useless and boring dialogs  bad script work . and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors . it could have been an interesting story though  but they failed completely .  

=======================================================================================================

1552 ===> malcolm mcdowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different . especially designed for people who like yellow filters on their movies .

1553 ===> if you  re one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as  book of the dead    book of eibon  or  necronomicon   then you should feel right at home with malefique  a film which also features an occult tome  one with the power to change the destinies of all involved . discovered by four french prisoners sharing a cell  the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by danvers  a serial killer incarcerated back in the     s a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished . finders of the book are carrre  grald laroche  a company embezzler shopped by his wife  lassalle  philippe laudenbach  who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body  builds to execute an escape plan  the halfwit pquerette  dimitri rataud  who once ate his baby sister  and the  librarian  marcus  clovis cornillac   supposedly driven mad by reading  who murdered his wife . reminding the viewer of meat loaf  s equally bizarre  bosomy male in fight club        lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet  one who is especially protective of the infantile pquerette . with the coming of the book however  and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents  marcus assumes greater and greater significance . at first assured of an early bail  meanwhile carrre takes little more than academic interest in events . suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and  as the prisoners experiment  danvers  book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers . . .  br    br   staged for the most part within a prison cell  and between four or five characters  malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter  as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers  . only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell  a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed  closed  in nature of proceedings elsewhere . more than anything  this is a film about being trapped  either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding .  i  m going to escape   says carrre at the start of the film  wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son . whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price  and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an  escape  may not be one a man might imagine .  br    br   with all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first  time feature director eric vallette  s credit that his film succeeds as well as it does . as critics have noticed  it is a film with strong freudian overtones  lassalle  s distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus danvers  original placenta fetish the dark cell as a primitive womb from which  delivery  is awaited  etc . with so many interesting aspects to the script vallette hardly puts a foot wrong  and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what  when one comes down to it  is just a matter of four guys  four bunks  one folding table and a book . there  s a genuine  growing  lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages  while one or two moments  the aforementioned blinking vagina  or what ultimately happens to pquerette  are unsettlingly memorable . the pacing of many of the dark events in malefique is deliberate  rejecting the rapid cutting of many hollywood productions a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick  fix action and gore . perhaps this is a particularly european manner  as one recalls a similar  measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as verhoeven  s the fourth man        a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye .  br    br   lensed well in  .      malefique benefits from excellent performances and  if for this viewer at least  the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been  the journey to the final shot was worth taking . coming so soon after the release of the similarly well  received haute tension  aka switchblade romance        this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the french industry  this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from asia  

=======================================================================================================

1554 ===> the film opens with bill coles  melvyn douglas  telling a story about how his best friend   make that client   jim blandings  cary grant  and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment  with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms . when jim  s wife  muriel  myrna loy   wants to renovate the apartment  advertising exec jim falls in love with  or falls for   an ad for a house . once he  s purchased the house  bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim  s  dream house  goes wrong .  br    br   one of three collaborations between grant and loy  this is a charming little comedy   not very taxing  with no real great message  but a great way to spend an hour or two . the laughs are there right from the start  when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off  only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel . the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros  and that  s just what grant and loy give us polished performances  simple chemistry  and a lot of fun . myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role  it  s evident that grant  s character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting  and grant  as always  pulls both off with remarkable aplomb   but she gives muriel a colour  life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character . melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well  never hitting a single wrong note .  br    br   one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the  store room   and jim goes to  save  him . . . only to get everyone trapped inside  every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project   including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for  wham    seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch .      

=======================================================================================================

1555 ===> this is one of the worst  written movies i  ve ever had to sit through .  br    br   the story  s nothing new   but it  s a cartoon  so who cares  as long as it  s pretty and fun   br    br   i  m not going to go as deep as the characterisations  or i  ll be here all day  except to say that there aren  t any the characters change personality whenever it  s convenient to the plot   but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper . thumbs down  i  d vote to cut their thumbs off .  br    br    narrow in on an object  prop . cut back to character close  up . character gives a knowing look  which the audience will not even remotely understand . repeat that several times  with different objects  props .   br    br    make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around  crashing into each other  generally raining destruction all over  and which could kill them all at any moment   but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless  looking  almost pastoral green rock in the distance .   br    br   the whole thing is a long succession of events  actions  and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer  to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly .  br    br   this is the plan  of cg cartoons  except that it doesn  t have ed wood groan factor to make it fun to watch .  br    br   do yourselves a favour spend your cartoon budget on pixar movies .  

=======================================================================================================

1556 ===> terrible use of scene cuts . all continuity is lost  either by awful scripting or lethargic direction . that villainous robot . . . musta been a jazz dancer  also  one of the worst sound tracks i  ve ever heard  monologues usually drowned out by music .  and . . . where  d they get their props  that ship looks like a milk carton . . . i did better special effects on  mm at the age of     br    br   i  d recommend any film student should watch this flick   minutes at a time  so as to learn how not to produce a film . or . . . was it the editors  fault   br    br   it  s really too bad  because the scenario was actually a good concept . . . just poorly executed all the way around .  sorry malcom . you should have sent a  stunt double  . you  re too good an actor for such a stink  bomb .   

=======================================================================================================

1557 ===>   malfique  is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well  executed plot and a lot of heart . its cast doesn  t have recognized names  it doesn  t have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well  written script  an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills . eric valette may not be a well  know name yet  but with  malfique   his feature length debut  he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet  gans or aja .  br    br   the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell  four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal to get out . carrre  grald laroche  gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi  millionaire fraud his cell  mates  the violent marcus  clovis cornillac   the intellectual lassalle  philippe laudenbach  and the mentally challenged pquerette  dimitri rataud   are all convicted for murder and give carrre a cold welcome . their personalities will clash as carrre discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic .  br    br   written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier   malfique  is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker  s stories . the movie  s strongest point is the way it builds up the characters  they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities . the story  s supernatural element is very well  handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel . despite being a movie about four men locked in a room  the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact  the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust  claustrophobia  and specially  paranoia .  br    br   director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere  mood and his cast to give life to the plot . despite its obvious lack of budget  he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original  fresh and very attractive . his subtle and effective camera  work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location  and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot . the very few displays of special effects are very well  done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore .  br    br   the characters are what make this film work  and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit . grald laroche is excellent as carrre  a man at first sight innocent  but who hides a dark past . philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too  specially rataud in his very demanding role . however  is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus  a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself . the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them .  br    br   the movie is terrific  but it is not without its share of flaws . of course  the most notorious one is its the low  budget . some of the cgi  effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make  up and prosthetics used in other scenes  however  it is never too bad for it . probably the bad thing about  malfique  is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters  not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view .  br    br   anyways   malfique  is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately  and one that deserves to have more recognition . valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest  albeit complex  tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities . personally  this film is a new favorite .

1558 ===> when i was six yo  i learned about a series called  los campeones   and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch  the champions  and  the avengers  once every week . i think that was the golden age of english series . . .  i already own the complete cycle of  the prisoner    but lasted also a few years later with  the tomorrow people    the worst witch   i just me  or this is  harry potter  in girl  of course  before as much as i want  the campions  to be in zone  or zone   i  m also waiting for  dr . who   pack the whole series in a set of  uhm  maybe    dvd  s  please  i couldn  t expend more for it      people of tomorrow   and several other  low budget   but great stories to be available within my reached zones . i speak and understand english  but not all my relatives do  including my parents  whom introduced me into these great stories . . . i hope someday  someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them . . . dubbed or subtitled  but in the same format i saw them . remember  zone  or  are ok with my tv set

=======================================================================================================

1560 ===> this is one of those  so bad it is good  films that you always hear about but never see  unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy  and i am not amused  this one is     pure serious .  br    br   however with features such as a supposedly super  lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining .  br    br   watcheable enough because of that .  

=======================================================================================================

1561 ===> my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re  runs of it one summer in the      s . we absolutely adored it . there was something so exotic and mysterious about it  especially when compared to the usual american re  runs  petticoat junction  green acres . . . you get the idea  . it had a similar feel to the avengers  not too much of a surprise  since it was also british and in the spy  adventure genre  .  br    br   i would love to see it again now   hopefully it holds up . i  ve mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it  so i began to wonder if i  d imagined its whole existence . but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it . hopefully it will find a new generation of fans .  

=======================================================================================================

1562 ===> well  what can i say  other than these people are super in every way . i quite like sharon mcreedy  i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of  discs   episodes  i did not realise that they had made so many  i also think that it is a great shame  that they have not made any more . i wish that i got given these powers  imagine me  being knocked off my cycle  somewhere and being knocked out cold  then waking up in a special hospital . later on  i discover that my body has been enhanced . just like richard barrat . these stories are   minutes of pure action and suspense all the way  you cannot fight these  people  as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry . the music is well written  and to me  puts a wonderful picture of  super beings in my mind  the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats  improved sight  improved hearing and touch . and the strength of   men for richard and craig and the strength of  women for sharon . who i thought was beautiful and intelligent . when i was a boy  i had a huge crush on her     now i can see why  on my dvd set . the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series . i also thought that trymane was a good boss  firm but he got things done   

=======================================================================================================

1563 ===> i just watched this movie in high definition on television . i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities .  br    br   at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating . his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society  s job market is great . and my problem isn  t with the real person who did these things . he was a great man . but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching  that i found it insulting .  br    br   first of all  they didn  t cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability . sure they were competent actors  but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film . further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches  appearing to have only one leg . but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful . what  they couldn  t find an actual amputee anywhere for the film  for a  second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee  at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am .  br    br   figure that out .  

=======================================================================================================

1564 ===> i was so disappointed in this movie . i don  t know much about the true story  so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history . with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination . well  somewhere the screenplay failed them . it was so scattered  is this movie about his childhood  his love life  his own disability  his speaking ability  his passion for the disabled  i  m sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story  but this movie wasn  t it . i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities  but because of their personalities . other small gripes  . the heavy  handed soundtrack . it  s the seventies  we get it already   . if he  s such a phenomenal public speaker  why weren  t we treated to more than a snippet here and there  and even then mostly in montages   

=======================================================================================================

1565 ===> i was   years old when this show was on tv . by far it was my favorite . the actors were very credible . alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous . . . . i just order the dvd    episodes  . they didn  t have super  powers . they just had superior human skills  strength  hearing  sight  . the  actors were very good in their rolls  very believable . there was a good story in each episode . at the time  there were no special effects or explosions everywhere  so the script was suppose to be good  and the characters performs were great . there was no fancy stuff  like in other shows . they didn  t try to make a joke every  minutes to make a light show . i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff .  

=======================================================================================================

1566 ===> i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic  comedy i have ever seen . it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation . the thought that maybe they won  t get together . . . it is an indie film after all . this movie was well written  directed and acted . the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent .

1567 ===> disappointing and undeniably dull true  crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer  who was easily one of the last century  s most recognizable degenerates  serial killers . released straight  to  video back in early       dahmer  is an overtly talky  boring  badly acted and virtually bloodless snore  fest of a true  crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do  what it does  however  attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely  nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin  for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold  calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was  overall       s  dahmer  is one that true  crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i  m not kidding when i say that it  s one of the worst serial  killer biopics ever done  it  s even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight  to  video trash like  gacy    bundy    ed gein  and  the night stalker    turkey  zero stars   

=======================================================================================================

1568 ===>   dahmer  is an interesting film although i wouldn  t use  horror  or  thriller  do describe it . it  s more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer .  br    br   jeremy renner portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer  who drugged  murdered and dismembered his male victims . the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and  rodney   well  played by artel kayru .  br    br   rodney is almost the more interesting character enamored of dahmer and having once escaped an attack  he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attack .  br    br   i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray dahmer  s formative years  how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into dahmer  s belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims .  br    br   the roles are well played but the story is thin .

1569 ===> manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences . the worst one is the lack of closet space  some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full   br    br   melvin frank and norman panama  a great comedy writing team from that era  saw the potential in eric hodgins novel  whose hero  jim blandings  can  t stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife muriel  and two daughters  must share .  br    br   jim blandings  a madison ave . executive  has had it  when he sees an ad for connecticut living  he decides to take a look . obviously  a first time owner  jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent . this is only the beginning of his problems .  br    br   whatever could be wrong  goes wrong . the architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn  t work for the new house  after the original one is razed . as one problem leads to another  more money is necessary  and whatever was going to be the original cost  ends up in an inflated price that jim could not really afford .  br    br   the film is fun because of the three principals in it . cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings . myrna loy  was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr . grant . the third character  bill cole  an old boyfriend of myrna  turned lawyer for the blandings  is suave and debonair  the way melvin douglas portrayed him . one of the blandings girls  joan  is played by sharyn moffett  who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint . the great louise beavers plays gussie  but doesn  t have much to do .  br    br   the film is lovingly photographed by james wong howe  who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better . the direction of h . c . potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies .  

=======================================================================================================

1570 ===> this movie is wonderful . the writing  directing  acting all are fantastic . very witty and clever script . quality performances by actors  ally sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky . really original and heart  warmingly unpredicatable . the scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production .  

=======================================================================================================

1571 ===> it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of america  s most notorious serial killers  but sadly it doesn  t even come close . terrible editing  direction  bad acting  you name it . this movie is literally about   minutes of plot stretched into    . the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father  but that  s not nearly enough to save this stinker . a  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

1572 ===> curiosity led me to this  masterpiece  . unfortunately  i didn  t rent it  i bought it  the most disturbing thing about this film is that it  s not so disturbing . for reasons known only to them  the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer . are you kidding me  the man gave new meaning to the term  finger lickin  good   and with all the flash  backs and flash  forwards i had trouble following the story . all in all jeremy renner  s performance wasn  t too bad . you can catch him in  s . w . a . t .   in which he plays a disgruntled ex  cop . anyway  i would rate this as a     . it only got a  because of renner  s so  so performance . there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer  s crimes . avoid this one .  

=======================================================================================================

1573 ===> real cool  smart movie . i loved sheedy  s colors  especially the purple car . alice drummond is wise and wonderful as stella . i liked sheedy  s reference to how her face had gotten fatter . the roadside dance scene is brilliant . really liked this one .  

=======================================================================================================

1574 ===> i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne  s  waitress        . this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie . adrienne was a marvelously talented writer  director  an original and unique artist . she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency . ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge . male lead reg rodgers  looking like judd nelson  is fine . there is also a great cameo by ben vereen . the song at the end of the movie  the bastard song  written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy  br    br    it  s a world of suffering   br    br   in a sea of pain   br    br   no matter how much sun you bring   br    br   you  re pummeled by the rain . . .  br    br   don  t let the heartless get you down   br    br   don  t greet the heartless at your door   br    br   don  t live among the heartless   

=======================================================================================================

1575 ===> i do have the guts  to inform you to please stay away from dahmer   the biographical film based on the real  life story of the grotesque serial killer . dahmer  strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject . jeffrey dahmer  who murdered over   young males and ate some of their body parts  was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation . however  the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful dahm  project . this is not an easy film to digest  even though jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery brainsadillas  appetizers or even some real  life mr . potato skins  .  failure  

=======================================================================================================

1576 ===> well  it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but i feel i must say something . i wasn  t exactly looking for  a splatterfest  as someone puts it or even  blood and guts  gore  . i have some respect for the victims relatives although i really felt the filmaker didn  t .  they were nameless  faceless and meaningless . just a vessel for dahmers sexual antics .  br    br   i watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think  what makes a guy be a serial killer   as well as wondering the specifics about the dahmer story  of which i know very little . people here seem to think that the movie didn  t have to cover the events of the dahmer story . . i . e . his history  what happened when he got caught  the aftermath  etc but it is important  you see  i assume if you are american you will know all of this . we do not all live in america . to tell this story about such a man as he obviously was  requires that at least some of the history and actual events are told  shown . this doesn  t mean blood and guts  there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore . without even touching upon some of what he did  i found out more about him reading the user comments on this site    the movie felt like a void . a moment in time with very little substance . i would like to know if there is a film about the real dahmer because with its lack of direction  very slow pace that never changes  strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending  this movie is poor . i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it . a definite  out of    for the acting    

=======================================================================================================

1577 ===> this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail . there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven  t come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one . this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film . at first  the action seems rather off  the  wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves  even if grudgingly  through each other . rogers  heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy  s angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them . you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it  s in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread . hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt .  

=======================================================================================================

1578 ===> for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and  i guessed  all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies .  br    br   this film was a real surprise despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces  the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we  the viewer  got back was almost true suspension of belief . when the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police  you almost believed it was possible .  br    br   if you are a fan of some of the better sex farces  canadian or not  you should definitely seek this one out . and the big surprise  this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity .  

=======================================================================================================

1579 ===> prior to watching  dahmer   i thought no movie could be worse than  freddy got fingered .  i was wrong . to sum  dahmer  up  it  s a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmer  s encounters with gay men before they were killed . there is no plot to be found  and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about  dahmer .  all you  ll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men . horrible acting  horrible directing  horrible writing  horrible everything . . . if you have to choose between watching  dahmer  and projectile vomiting for three hours  go with the vomiting . . . . it wll be less painful . . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1580 ===> i  m a big fan of the true crime genre  but i couldn  t sit through this putrid piece . it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica  down to the porn  flic soundtrack . there was no look at what made dahmer tick  no exploration of who his victims were . nothing but  look at how creepy this guy is .  and i have to give the filmmakers this much   their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen .  

=======================================================================================================

1581 ===> aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie  i think i  ve watched every movie guy ritchie has directed . twice . needless to say  i  m a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why . this movie is a very different approach from ritchie  when you look at it comparatively with lock  stock . . . and snatch . revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn  t expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn  t know he needed . along with seeing andr benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability  other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr . d  macha and mark strong playing sorter  the hit  man .  br    br   after being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner  macha  jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent . when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha  jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that  s left him with three days to live . a team of loan sharks  however  have an answer for him and a ticket to life  only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them  all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself . along with having the air of death loom  and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money  jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him  which introduces sorter  a hit  man under macha  s employ . the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co  convicts he spent time with in solitary may very  well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into . when faced with this reality though  zack  vincent pastore  and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary  having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake . the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons .  br    br   the style of the movie is top  notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes . although a lot of nods at ritchie  s previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue  the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre . it  s also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should . the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and  true to ritchie fashion  they  re all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone  s affairs . i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i don  t want to take too much away from it if you haven  t seen it yet .  br    br   it may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it  s a great movie and it should be seen . if you  re lucky and you haven  t seen the watered  down us release  see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take . i saw it with my crew around early      and we  re still talking about it with little things we  ve picked up on today . it has garnered its cult status  and it  s well  deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit .  br    br   standout line  fear or revere me  but please  think i  m special . we share an addiction . we  re approval junkies .   

=======================================================================================================

1582 ===>   ah ritchie  s made another gangster film with statham  thought the average fan  expecting another snatch  lock stock expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts  but none too hard for  me and the lads  to swallow after a few beers .  br    br   ah  pay attention  you do need to watch this film . no cups of tea  no extra diet cokes from the counter  no  keep it running  shouts as you nip to the fridge  watch the film  no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence  and if that floats your boat  so be it  but sharp solid direction  excellent dialogue  and great performances .  br    br   my favourite  big pussy from the sopranos  always a reliable hood .  

=======================================================================================================

1583 ===> i really felt cheated after seeing this picture . it felt like i sat watching this movie    minutes for nothing . i don  t understand what they were thinking when they made this . it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending . it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel . it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos . it ends suddenly  and you know there  s going to be another episode next week . it also felt like i just watched part  to a two part movie . there are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy  they ran out of money  they didn  t know the rest of the story  they wanted to make a dahmer  . after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate . i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods . all of a sudden i hear this music playing  then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served  years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of   . wow  he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail . how about showing how he got there . how about showing dahmer  s trial . how about showing some more detail . i can  t even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place . i actually found myself saying in disbelief   that  s it  that  s the end   i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made . to the filmmakers i  d like to say  if you  re going to do it  do it right .  

=======================================================================================================

1584 ===> don  t waste your time on this dreck . as portrayed  the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture .  gothic  was entertainment at least  this is crap . if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other  this may be right up your alley . lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk  and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering . mary shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever  but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect . what a waste of time . see gothic instead . i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter  but didn  t catch the title . i was hoping this was it  but no such luck . not recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

1585 ===> i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art . i was very surprised to see the overall rating as  .  .  br    br   not only does guy bring together a b list  ish  movie cast and make them into such glorious characters  he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination .  br    br   far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate . . . yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable .  br    br   this film is special . get it  now   

=======================================================================================================

1586 ===> i  m giving ten out of ten it  s one of the best movies ever . absolutely smashed  stunned and dazed by the whole picture  marvellous playing of jason statham  ray liotta and all the crew  amazing plot . . . just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit  it touched your soul  because it  s strange  but there are all the answers you  ve been ever looking for . . . the very best  mr . ritchie  the very best ever . those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed . but there are lots of shallow movies in hollywood nowadays  you can  t remember what it was about the next day you had seen it . on the contrary  revolver is unique  i could have hardly expected it  s possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself  of everyone who was to watch it . absolutely unsurpassed  astounding  dazzling . . . one can get insight watching this  i have no doubt about that . actually  no words can express my admiration . . . i  m still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy hollywood rubbish we had been watching . thank you from all heart  it  s simply the best .  

=======================================================================================================

1587 ===> the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used . if ms . pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer .  br    br   otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies . as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value  which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get . perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to  de  commercialize  their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing  movies by definition are a commercial thing . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1588 ===> saw in on tv late last night . yeah  i can hear what y  all say about this one . it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo  typical tv soap series . in all fairness  the story line does have a fine twist to it  and you might nod saying   well  that  s not what i expected .  but  as a film  well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element . casting  acting  camera work  cars  costume  setting  script  no  there  s nothing to congratulate . rated r   oh  that scene . did we need it  this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched . and what was the title again   

=======================================================================================================

1589 ===> i have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life . believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all  time classic . i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock  stock . . . . and snatch  but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed . i absolutely loved this film and i can  t wait to see it again . this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films  and also a lot better . i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie . i believe he has taken movie  making to another level  i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film  but i believe time will prove me right  . this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the  hr or so running time as i couldn  t stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together . i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film  some answers from endless hours of thinking  some answers from reading other people  s take on the film  and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again . i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been .  

=======================================================================================================

1590 ===> neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist  revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers . but then  nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew  especially one using the gangster  con  artist movie framework . as might be expected from luc besson  s name on the credits as producer  there  s a definite element of  cinema de look  about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap  it looks great  has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style  all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment . but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck  and he  s spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life  the universe and everything . if anything its problem is that he  s trying to throw in too many influences  a bit of machiavelli  a dash of godard  a lot of the principles of chess   motifs and techniques  littering the screen with quotes the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims  and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn  t want to turn into a movie . rather than a commercial for kabbalism  it  s really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce  chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film  s central  somewhat metaphysical  con .  br    br   the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy  literally  within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people  s exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger  but it  s got a lot going for it all the same . not worth starting a new religion over  but i  m surprised it didn  t get a us distributor . maybe they found ray liotta  s intentionally fake tan just too damn scary   

=======================================================================================================

1591 ===> taped this late night movie when i was in grade    watched it on fast forward . i sugest you do the same . i though it would be and action film  but went to a cort tv type movie . in the end it fits in with the early    s social activest type films . glad i missed that era .      

=======================================================================================================

1592 ===> once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h . beam piper who wrote a classic book named  little fuzzy  which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet . mr . piper died in      but hollywood and many of today  s authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold . this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from .  br    br   skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of  little fuzzy  i can wonder why i  m the only who  s ever noticed   br    br   but don  t take my word for it . here  s a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of  little fuzzy  for free http   www . gutenberg . org  ebooks        

=======================================================================================================

1593 ===> i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone  the fact is it wasn  t what anyone was expecting  especially from guy ritchie . what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners  do ya like dags   etc  but this is far more mature than his previous works . i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder  this film demands all your attention  look past the cool and dazzling look of the film  try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film .  br    br   yes this has its influences from modern classics  fight club  pulp fiction etc  but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none . i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney  masterpieces  .  

=======================================================================================================

1594 ===> first of all  don  t go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock  this is a different sort of gangster film .  br    br   i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience . it  s the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that  that was awful  and the other half will leave thinking what was that  that was cool . personally i like films that i don  t understand  i . e . mullholland drive  and usual suspects  so i enjoyed revolver .  br    br   it definitely wasn  t perfect though . i saw the big twist coming a mile away  at least part of it  and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good  revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed . also some scenes  like the animation  and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree  actually one of my favourites   although  awesome scenes to watch  seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch  not because they fit in with the movie .  br    br   however there were many good things too . i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors  jason stratham  ray liotta  vincent pastore  and even andre benjamin  who was a pleasant surprise  . this movie definitely kept my interest  with one great  suspenseful  action packed  scene after another . when ray liotta was being held under the table wow . . . . well you have to see it . the script was extremely well done  and the soundtrack  as with most guy ritchie films  was great .  br    br   though a step below such movies as  fight club  mullholland drive  and usual suspects  it was still an awesome fast paced  psychological  action movie  with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over .  

=======================================================================================================

1595 ===> the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine . all i can say is  it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film . as far as i could tell  borgnine was the only actor in it . the other performances were so uniformly terrible  i am amazed a studio would actually pay the  performers  to appear . couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled  and you have a perfect cinematic disaster . obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children  and to its credit  it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid  focused networks . but honestly  that is not saying much .  

=======================================================================================================

1596 ===> honestly  where can i begin  this was a low budget  horribly acted film  it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was  the sword fighting scenes weren  t even sword fights  they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal  mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling   me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day  so we decided to go to the store and look for one  and there it was the sawtooth island movie . i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene .  br    br   oh and the plot of the film  the story board  the script  etc . . was a bunch of garbage that i don  t even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it   but if you happen to stumble upon this movie . . do not get it

1597 ===> i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think  and don  t just drip  feed the answers to their audience .  revolver  is one of these films  and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow  with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it . first time . true  it doesn  t compare to other mind  mucks like  the usual suspects  or  memento   but in its own right its an intelligent and thought  provoking film .  br    br   another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is . every scene  every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages . if you see it you  ll know what i mean .  br    br   so  to conclude . . . watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it . if not  well  no  one ever said  revolver  is for everyone . and that  s my  cents .  

=======================================================================================================

1598 ===> in the classic sense of the four humors  which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment   altman  s  h . e . a . l . t . h .  treats all of the humors  and actually in very funny  entertaining ways . there  s the phlegm  as personified by lauren bacall  s very slow  guarded  and protective character esther brill  who  s mission in life appears to be all about appearance  protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well  being . there  s paul dooley  s choleric dr . gil gainey  who like a fish out of water  perhaps more like a seal  flops around frenetically  barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness . the melancholy of glenda jackson  s isabella garnell smacks of shakespeare  s troubled and self  righteous hamlet   even proffering a soliloquy or two . and let  s not forget henry gibson  s bile character  bobby hammer   the breast that feeds the baby rules the world   . then there  s the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank  james garner and carol burnett  respectively   relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for h . e . a . l . t . h .   a kind of world trade organization specializing in h . e . a . l . t . h .  which is to say anything but health . this is altman at his classic best .  

=======================================================================================================

1599 ===> i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron . i thought   wonderful  this will be great   i was so wrong . the story was all screwed up . in fact i still don  t get it . it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink  smoke  opium   and have sex . not that those aren  t good movie qualities  but please  where was the story  i made myself finish the movie  and yes  it did pick up towards the end  but by then the movie was almost over . rent it if you really want to . just don  t trust the back of the box .  

=======================================================================================================

1600 ===> you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies . this one comes complete with bad effects  props and bad acting  really bad  . plus  every time i see mercedes mcnab  the sister  i keep thinking  watch out  she  s a vamp    for those that know buffy  angel .  br    br   a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick  the little that was spent of course . i don  t know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn  t make back any money .  br    br   i  d say it  s good for little kids in it  s simplicity  but i don  t know if i  d want to subject a kid to it . . .  br    br   umm . . .     because that  s the lowest it will go .  

=======================================================================================================

1601 ===> ok . . . this movie so far has been slated by critics and board  posters alike  although playing devil  s advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn  t make it for themselves as film  makers  and board posters are often people who didn  t make it for themselves as critics  so i wanted to sit in guy  s corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who  ve decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it .  br    br   the film  s biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is . this has been described many times as as making the film  inaccessible  to the viewer . the film  s chronology is relatively non  linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle  or not so subtle  hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory  ie . ray liotta  s character brandishing a gun saying the words  fear me  is portrayed as both tragically pathetic  from statham  s pov  or interrogating and bold  from liotta  s pov  . this is but one example of ritchie  s far more mature approach he has taken to film  making with revolver  we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal  the strong but silent gritty anti  hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption . . . i mean it  s paint by numbers film noir here guys  all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice  overs  but then guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points .  br    br   take the scene where jason statham  s character runs afoul of a car . this throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever . . . but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death .  br    br   so the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling  i  d be taking the pss if i said i didn  t spend the last   minutes or so of the film turning to my date going  uh . . . wtf   . . . but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art . it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand . and even easier to say  well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film   . in my humble opinion  revolver is a stylish  complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the saatchi brothers . if we choose this opportunity to collectively say  ah sht  i wanted a film about a load of bleeding  cockney gangsters in  nit loll . . . guy ritchie is a tit   then the day will come when film  makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow  crappy people . just because guy made a name for himself with funny  cheeky cockney romps  doesn  t mean he can  t be deep without being  pretentious  . funny people can be thoughtful too .  

=======================================================================================================

1602 ===> i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid  and  naturally  was moved to tears by this story of a fox family . the fantastic scenery at hokkaid  the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists . i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack . to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defa  dubbing is the only one worth listening to . i taped both  defa and br  but i keep viewing the first one only .  

=======================================================================================================

1603 ===> i know it  s a power  rangers gimmick and catered to  year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie  if they are going to write a plot with crayons  at least have the decency to make it silly . it  s kind of hilarious if you watch this . we have a typical family filled with cliched characters  father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol   air  head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting  and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space . funny stuff   br    br   however  the real great moment comes near the end when war  dad and bad  acting  villain try to work a sword fight  but then they realize none of them know how to  probably because no room in budget for choreographers   so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in . lol .  br    br       rating because they try to treat this seriously .  

=======================================================================================================

1604 ===> this film was on late at night when i saw it . it was interesting at start but it didn  t convince me as a whole . i am no tyson fan . in fact i don  t like boxing at all . it  s barbaric  obscene and double faced  by society  that some get money for beating each other up .  br    br   nevertheless  i felt the start of the film was ok . actors alright  especially george c . scott  as cus d  amato  . i don  t know how reliable the flick is . i haven  t read books and books about boxing or tyson . i don  t know anything about the man  but it was quite entertaining .  br    br   as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of it  s charm and i also lost interest . i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough .  

=======================================================================================================

1605 ===>   br    br   i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old  i bugged my parents to take me back three times . i began looking for it on video about five years ago  finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site  but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased  i understand the original video run was small   or have the rights purchased by the family channel  disney  etc . and shown regularly . it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan  narrated by a wise old tree . the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well . it would be a good seller today  better than many of the weak offerings to children  s movies today .  

=======================================================================================================

1606 ===> i have been looking for this movie for so many years . i saw this move when i was nine and loved this movie . i called disney all the movie stores and the net . no luck . what a waste it was a very good movie . it will be missed   

=======================================================================================================

1607 ===> tyson  br    br   aspect ratio  .      br    br   sound format stereo  br    br   reverent  though scrupulously fair  account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson . given his conviction on a rape charge  the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain  but paints a warts  and  all portrait of his rise to fame  the pressures of success  and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad . constrained by time limits  the script gallops through a succession of relevant details  alighting briefly on significant events  culminating with tyson  s  temporary  downfall in     . novices will be enlightened by the chronology  while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel  s straight  arrow approach to the material . he portrays tyson  s life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success . in fact  the script reserves most of its venom for tyson  s ex  wife robin givens  characterising her as an ungrateful gold  digger who took advantage of his naivety . production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character george c . scott plays tyson  s mentor cus d  amato through acres of gritted teeth and paul winfield was surely born to play don king   

=======================================================================================================

1608 ===> as far as spaghetti westerns go  i  d put this man can  t die on the dull side of the genre . it  s not that the movie is particularly bad  but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i  ve seen . guy madison does his best in the lead role  but lacks the on  screen charisma necessary to pull it off . with one notable exception  the rest of the cast isn  t particularly good . the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven  t seen before . there  s just not much to get very excited about .  br    br   the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri . she  s the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film . unfortunately  her screen time is limited to less than   minutes .  note the imdb page for this man can  t die is wrong . rosalba neri does not play jenny benson . instead  she is the character melin . i  m not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb  s credits for the movie .   

=======================================================================================================

1609 ===> i recommend families if possible  to show this to older children only . some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle . now that thats out of the way  let me explain about this movie . this is in reality a documentary of a male fox  who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate . the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score  is breath taking . you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible  it  ll get ugly later . they gave both the fox and the vixen names  but i can  t remember what they are for the likes of me . he fights off this invading male  to win her love . they later on create a den  and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubsone of which is blind . there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family  but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon . the first victim is the blind pup  who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away . the second victim is the mother  who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole . she unknowingly walks into a foot trap . while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot  causing her to bleed to death . the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree . the male is now a single dad  forced to take on the roll of mom and dad . he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life . it later proves not to be enough  when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man . i won  t spoil the surprising ending for you  but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail . and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through . i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early     s  when we had a thing called showbiz cable . i was only  when i saw it  but i could never understand why they wouldn  t let me see all of it . now i know why  after i secretly watched it when it came on disney  when i was  . i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on . i was moved to tears . but as dark and ugly as it was  it serves a purpose . to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals  and why they are endangered . this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species  and i hoped it worked . its not fake like the true life nature films by disney  they don  t teach about why animals are going extinct . the encroachment of land  the killing off of the foxes main prey  and senseless killing of these beautiful animalshas resulted in them becoming endangered . i wish they would make sequel to this movie   glacier fox      to see if they  re being treated better . maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her siblings growing up . this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes  especially when one of the parents suddenly dies . the surviving parent takes on the roll of both  and tries to teach the important lessons of life . it isn  t always enough to protect them when they  re adults  especially when some of their lives becomes ruined . or they fall victims to tragedy themselves . best all around soundtrack and musical score i  ve ever heard .  

=======================================================================================================

1610 ===> the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing  that is what i guess makes him so mean . i don  t think most men will like this movie  especially if they ever cheated on their wife . this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end . but then  there you have it  a candy  bar ending that makes me look back and say   hokie as hell .  a pretty good movie until the end . ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning . and then there is the aftermath of what happened . guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending . i  m left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end .  

=======================================================================================================

1611 ===> this is an ok film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling .  br    br   the story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none  also no real suspense .  br    br   washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it  there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast .  br    br   the story simply falls a little flat  even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact  you don  t really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare .  br    br   there is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside who hero worships carter but this seems forced .  br    br   it  s an ok film but instantly forgettable .  

=======================================================================================================

1612 ===> fairly good movie  but not a true story .  br    br   rubin  hurricane  carter was a notorius liar  a murder and was never found not guilty . new jersey state just didn  t go for it a third time as   years had gone . carter got an offer in       pass a lie test and go free  . he didn  t take it . this film should never have been made  but money talks . a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white . why choose a fake story   br    br   jens  

=======================================================================================================

1613 ===> some of the acknowledged altman  masterpieces  seem sadder to me now . maybe it  s me . like the last reviewer  i even like this  lesser  altman  shown recently on fmc   although i don  t think he was aiming at a wide audience . organization politics as a  microcosm  for public campaigns . some of this satirical  docudrama  is now dated  like dick cavett watching the tonight show  but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful  e . g .  you are for real . that means you  re no threat to anyone   . the story isn  t  profound   but i liked it . and the performances are funny  especially cavett  as  himself    lauren bacall as an aging conservative figurehead  glenda jackson  who actually became a member of parliament  as a left wing ideologue  in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics   and carol burnett as a basket case . all in the inimitable altman style  although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual . but pretty inimitable .  

=======================================================================================================

1614 ===> successful self  made married businessman harry mitchell  a superbly steely performance by roy scheider  has an adulteress fling with sweet  n  sexy young stripper cini  the gorgeous kelly preston  . harry  s blackmailed by a trio of scummy low  life hoods   sleazy porno theater manager raimy  a splendidly slimy john glover   antsy strip joint owner leo  well played by robert trebor  and crazed pimp bobby shy  a frightfully intense clarence williams iii    who have videotaped his affair with cini . when harry refuses to pay up  the hoods kill cini and make it look like harry did it . this in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between harry and the hoods . director john frankenheimer  adopting a tough script based on elmore leonard  s gritty crime thriller novel  expertly maintains a steady snappy pace  delivers plenty of gripping tension  and effectively creates a compellingly seedy  n  sordid atmosphere . the leads are all uniformly excellent  with stand  out supporting turns by ann  margret as harry  s bitter neglected wife barbara  vanity as brash jaded prostitute doreen  and lonny chapman as harry  s loyal business partner jim o  boyle . the tight  n  twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout . the wickedly profane dialogue  jost vacano  s glossy cinematography  gary chang  s stirring score  the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well . as an added bonus  both vanity and preston take their clothes off . a very strong and satisfying little number that  s well worth checking out .  

=======================================================================================================

1615 ===> this movie looks like it was made for tv . for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter  because i loved to see him box at the old msg  and to see this movie was very disappointing . i have alot of respect for mr washington  but he was awful and boring . there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song .  

=======================================================================================================

1616 ===> denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie .  br    br   maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie . someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie  giving away most of the story line in about the first  minutes . that and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before .  br    br   so first it confuses you and then it puts you off . the dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve .  br    br   of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers . granted  it does that so if you are looking for that . . . knock yourself out .  

=======================================================================================================

1617 ===>     pick up never got the respect it should have . it works on many levels  and has a complicated but followable plot . the actors involved give some of their finest performances . ann  margret  roy scheider  and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals . notable too are vanity  who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows  and kelly preston  who  s character will haunt you for a few days . anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this .  

=======================================================================================================

1618 ===> this is a great  small  film . i say  small  because it doesn  t have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions  as in a john woo film . great performances by roy scheider and the three  bad guys  . john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days . the film is very easy to watch  the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine   instead of everything going around and around  it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens . wonderful ending  very positive . i never read the elmore leonard book  but it can  t be much different from the film because it feels like i  m watching an elmore leonard movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1619 ===> if this movie was about a fictional character  the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively . unfortunately for the viewer  the movie is based on  facts  that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter . many of the smaller facts were disregarded  carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders  there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth   but some of the larger facts  like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of  racist  judges  is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape  and completely disrespectful to giardello . why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who  at best  was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be  was arrested multiple times for beating women  is strange to me . ruben carter was never  by viewing his actions in the    s and even now  when he refuses to speak to his son  a person that people can look up to . everyone knows that jewison can direct  and washington can act  but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me . is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable   heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself  now thats inspirational  based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie  i would suggest passing on this one .  

=======================================================================================================

1620 ===> this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with . saw it   years ago as an adolescent  stayed up late to do so  was very annoyed to find that it was about    romance    everything else    history if that . it  s what i call a bait and switch movie  one with an interesting title  the actual movie is a scam . this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment  this movie is almost an insult to those who served . the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes  they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france . and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter  s character . flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls  an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn  t have lasted two days  it would have either been the stockade or the infantry . discipline in the french army was often rather fierce . in short  another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment .  

=======================================================================================================

1621 ===> i  ve always liked this john frankenheimer film . good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasn  t just another thriller is because of frankenheimer . his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference  he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant  you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made . i  ve always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance . clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he  s excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out . frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail  murder  sex  drugs  and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts . what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped  a guilty pleasure to say the least . vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance . a classic exploitive thriller that shouldn  t be forgotten .  

=======================================================================================================

1622 ===> based on elmore leonard  this is a violent and intelligent action film . the story a business man is blackmailed by some  criminals . roy schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit  s got to go to john glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath . i must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting  something that is very rare for an action film . also features some beautiful and sexy women  most notable are kelly preston as the young bate for schieder  s character . vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers . i  m glad to say that ann  margaret still hasn  t lost it  this lady is a true babe . don  t look at the rate of this film . i really don  t know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under  rated film . you will enjoy it  that  s a promise . recommended a .  

=======================================================================================================

1623 ===> i had high hopes for this film  because i thought clean  shaven  kerrigan  s first feature  was absolutely terrific  the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i  d ever seen .  br    br   but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat . scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix  without much thought for narrative or character .  br    br   is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not  hard to tell . why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life  why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle  why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color  why does claire accept some johns and not others  the filmmaker doesn  t seem to know .  br    br   it feels as if everything is improvised  though i understand this wasn  t the case  and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary .  br    br   after the screening i saw  kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative . it sounded like learned rhetoric . i think it was a cop  out .  br    br   i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean  shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old  political  cliches .  

=======================================================================================================

1624 ===> this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii . i was under ten years of age . and that  s the audience this serial is designed for . looking at it now  one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity . the budget must have been next to nothing  given the shortcuts and repeats . the acting  well  this is republic pictures      . they read the lines . . . . and no doubt had one take to make them convincing .  br    br   one and half stars .  

=======================================================================================================

1625 ===> brendan filone is the absolute best character in the sopranos . he died by getting shot in the eye . this was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the sopranos . brendan filone is too good . brendan filone shall haunt uncle junior in his dreams until uncle junior can  t take it anymore . brendan filone is the best character . brendan filone was killed in episode    denial  anger  acceptance . but his legacy will live on forever . brendan filone is the best character on sopranos  brendan filone is the best character ever . i recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing  because it doesn  t get any better than this series . brendan filone is the best .  

=======================================================================================================

1626 ===> chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos . unfaltering performances  rock  solid writing  and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever .  br    br   all of the cast are strong  but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy  s . anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons . james gandolfini is absolutely fierce  absolutely terrifying  and you still find yourself loving him  mesmerized by him .  br    br   many people that i  ve spoken to about the sopranos  who haven  t seen it yet  will say  i  m just not a fan of mafia movies  shows  . whatever . run  don  t walk  and get it . those same people usually love  e . r .   but i bet they don  t much care for hospitals . . . it  s not about the context .

1627 ===> the main problem with the documentary  czech dream  is that isn  t really saying what it thinks it  s saying .  br    br   in an audacious  i hesitate to use the word  inspired   act of street theater  vit klusak and filip remunda  two student filmmakers from the czech republic  pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately fabricated a phony  hypermarket   the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store   built an entire ad campaign around it  replete with billboards  radio and tv spots  an official logo  a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise  and then waited around to see just how many  dopes  would show up to their creation on opening day . they even built a makeshift faade to convince people that the store itself actually existed .  br    br   one might well ask   why do such a thing   well  that  s a very good question  but the answer the filmmakers provide isn  t all that satisfying a one . essentially  we  re told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something  even something that  s not true  simply through the power of advertising . and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the  real   i . e . higher  purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union . fair enough  especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers  all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of  research  into what does and does not work in advertising . in a way  by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments  these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse .  br    br   but  in many ways  the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target  it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it . for it is they themselves and not the good  hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here  as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people  some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot . and what is all this supposed to prove anyway  that people are  greedy  because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains  or that they  re stupid and gullible because they don  t suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised  such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world .  br    br   no  i  m afraid this smart  alecky  nasty little  stunt  only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots . and  indeed many of them  when they finally discover the trick that  s been played on them  react with a graciousness and good humor i  m not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position .  br    br   i  m not saying that the movie isn  t gripping  something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action  but  when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red  faced and empty  handed to their homes  we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed .

1628 ===> this is almost certainly the worst western i  ve ever seen . the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films   hero learns that family  friends have been murdered  so hero sets out to exact revenge  foils the ineffective lawman  rescues the kidnapped loving damsel  and murders the expert arch  nemesis in a brutal duel . this formula has often been successful   otherwise it wouldn  t be a formula   but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you  ll ever see . the scripting is atrociously simple  minded and insulting it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth  maturity  and realism . the sound is bad it sometimes looks dubbed . the cinematography is lame  and the sets are sometimes just facades . the acting is pitiful sure  some of the performers could blame the script  but others cannot use that excuse . i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again every time he says a line that should be angry or mean  he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho . and speaking of chris lybbert  who plays hopalong  check out his duds  if you dare to watch this film   he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard  working  down  and  dirty cowboy . if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy  then get this  but if you have more than two neurons  watch something else .

1629 ===> this is the definite lars von trier movie  my favorite  i rank it higher than  breaking the waves  or the latest  dancer in the dark  . . . i simply love the beauty of the picture . . . the framing is so original acting is wonderful  a must see .

1631 ===> loved the original story  had very high expectations for the film  especially since barker was raving about it in interviews   finally saw it and what can i say  it was a total mess  the directing is all over the place  the acting was atrocious  the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat  empty and completely unnecessary  whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast  forward  slow mo nonsense  it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn manson  smashing pumpkins  placebo music video  . whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal  some are just ridiculously laughable  the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted raimi  s death was just stupidly funny  . it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense  totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more . no explanations were given whatsoever  i mean i knew what was happening only as i  d read the story but for people who hadn  t it  s even more confusing as at times even i didn  t know where it was going and what it was trying to do  it was going on an insane tangent the whole time .  br    br   god  i really wanted to like this film as i  m a huge fan of barker  s work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie  hell i even enjoyed some of kitamura  s movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish  i didn  t care about anyone or anything  the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source  turning it into something else entirely . granted it was gory and vinnie jones played a superb badass  but everything else was all over the place  more than disappointing . gutted  

=======================================================================================================

1632 ===> i heard and read many praising things about  midnight meat train   which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original  hellraiser  that he directed himself  but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience . the most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is nauseating  the violence is sadistic and extreme  which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts  but it  s also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative . normally speaking  i  m very pro  violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose . the butchering  literally  depicted in  midnight meat train  is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs  and even that isn  t fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects . there are more shortcomings  some even bigger than the pointless gore  but perhaps i should focus on the good elements first . the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences  like the chase in the freezer room  for example  are literally oozing with nail  biting suspense and macabre atmosphere . unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted . presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities  but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by vinnie jones . the plot introduces leon  an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures . leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train . leon  s right  as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer  but the killer  s motivations and behavior suggest there  s something far more substantial going on the rails at night .  midnight meat train  takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs  plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images  like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood   but director ryhei kitamura   versus    godzilla final wars   doesn  t take full advantage of it all . the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and  even if clive barker meant to have like this  i still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale .  midnight meat train  is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film  but not without defaults . it  s not intended for easily offended viewers  but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well .  

=======================================================================================================

1633 ===> now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i  m appalled . for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i  m afraid i don  t know what the world has come to . let me tell u something . i started watching many t . v shows like lost  prison break  dexter  deadwood and even invasion . but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season  especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took  genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season . then we have the sopranos . i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season  and more importantly all of its episodes . there is no department that this show doesn  t excel in . acting  nothing short of superb . james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode  after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would  ve been the better choice  however after watching the first few episodes  i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony . the raw emotion he displays is superb . then we have everyone else  edie falco  michael imperioli  lorraine bracco  dominic chianese  whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part   and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie  walnuts  gualtieri and silvio dante . all of these actors perform to the best quality  and all giving an excellent performance in each episode . then we have the story  never have i been so sucked into a t . v show before . the story is nothing short of excellent . each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic . i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of . its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence  but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television  and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show . not just say its too violent  or they feel that the character of tony is immoral  i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day  i don  t think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god . i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me  you  ll be hooked from the very first episode  i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show  hooked on it . trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t . v . after you  ve watched the first season  you  ll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television  and no t . v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos .

1634 ===>   the godfather  of television  but aside from it  s acclaim and mobster characters  the two are nothing alike . tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks . his psychiatrist learns that tony is actually part of two families   in one family he is a loving father yet not  so  perfect  husband  and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy . after analysis  dr . melfi concludes that tony  s problems actually derive from his mother livia  who  s suspected to have borderline  personality disorder . gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character yet bracco and marchand aren  t nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother  respectively . falco  imperioli and dematteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles . van zandt  from the e  street band  plays his first and only role as tony  s best friend  and is quite convincing and latching . chianese  the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a godfather film  plays tony  s uncle and on  and  off nemesis . many fans also enjoyed characters played by pastore  ventimiglia  curatola  proval  pantoliano  lip  sciorra and buscemi . tony  s children are  okay  but not notable  with the exception of iler  s stunning performance in the third  to  last episode   the second coming    sirico and schirripa are unconvincing and over  the  top  but the show is too strong for them to hold it back . even as the show continues for over six season  it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment .  br    br     out of four   

=======================================================================================================

1635 ===> ok  so i just saw the movie  although it appeared last year . . . i thought that it was generally a decent movie  except for the storyline  which was stupid and horrible . . . first of all  we never get to know anything about the creatures  why they appeared  wtf are they doing in our world  and really  have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space  secondly  the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created . . . really  how large could the underground for a sub station could have been  there were only so many of those creatures  so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain  they could have just planted some tactical bombs  or maybe clear the are and a nuke would have done the job . i know it sounds funny and it is  but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary . . . thirdly  leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting vinnie jones  who was way taller and bigger in stature . then again  when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp  watching all the abominations . i mean ok  the conductor had creepy help  lol   but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way . . . i mean he risks his life first  then does nothing exactly when he should have . he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward . . . this might be the case  but not after showing so much braveness earlier on . . . then  the cop thing . . . come on  this was a city having a subway  i bet there must have been other cops except that lady  other police stations  this was really kind of silly . . . all in all  great acting by vinnie jones  interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all . . . by the way  what did the signs on the chest mean  vinnie jones cannot make up for the rest . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1636 ===> i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made . if you doubt me  please look at my other reviews . however  for the first time ever  i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over .  br    br   i love bad movies . to me  ed wood is a genius  i thought bloody murder  jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good . however  there is not a single good thing i can say about this film .  br    br   the plot is basically non existent . if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it  they can discern for themselves what the plot might be  but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie .  br    br   the special effects are bad .  br    br   the acting is bad .  br    br   the two leads are attractive  but that  s all there is .  br    br   i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone  but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarkingyahoo . com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it . i will tell you anything .  br    br   i love bad movies  and i love horror and i love new inventive movies . i even love horror porn stuff like hostel  which some reviewers claimed this was like  but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel   . but this may be the number  most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made .  br    br   and before you disregard this review  this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead  but actually bought a copy of it .  

=======================================================================================================

1637 ===> though  the sopranos  is yet another gift from the megahit  the godfather  and sequels  which dramatized and to a certain extent glamorized the mafia   the sopranos  takes another tack . no suited up  classy mobsters here with homes in lake tahoe and stakes in vegas casinos  these guys are goombahs  with a front of waste management  who deal with things that fall off the back of trucks  topless bars  protection money  in short  what the neighborhood mobs were all about .  br    br   colorful characters dominate this series  which doesn  t hold back on the sex and graphic violence . tony soprano  james gandolfini  is a mob head with a wife and two children  living in new jersey  who suffers from panic attacks as he tries to balance his biological family with his mafia one . to get to the bottom of his attacks  he sees a psychiatrist  jennifer melfi  lorraine bracco   who is afraid of him and yet attracted to him at the same time . tony  s henchman  paulie  his nephew christopher  his uncle junior  the titular head of the mob   his good friend pussy  are all fully fleshed  out characters .  br    br   as we learn going through the series  there are enemies not only from without  but from within  and one of those enemies includes tony  s sickly but horrible mother  nancy marchand   who convinces junior that tony is a danger to him . tony  s sister janice  meanwhile  is searching for money in her mother  s house with a stethoscope and a geiger counter . tony has mistress problems  and a wife  edie falco  who puts up with a lot because she loves him  all the while keeping ties to her catholic religion .  the church frowns on divorce   she tells one woman contemplating a split .  let the pope live with him   is the response . as far as tony  s mistress problems  his psychiatrist points out that tony is attracted to demanding women for whom nothing is ever enough  and asks him if it sounds familiar . yeah  it sounds like his mother .  br    br   i  m of italian descent  and yes  i  m sick of italians being shown in a negative light and everyone assuming all italians are mobsters . yet you can  t help liking this show  which is a constant reminder of our culture .  thanksgiving  it  s pointed out  isn  t turkey and sweet potato pie  it  s the antipasto  the manicotti  the meatballs and escarole  and then the bird   not to mention  the right  on pronunciation of words like melenzana  mullinyan   escarole  scarole   manicotti  manigot  etc . the only un  italian thing about tony is that he doesn  t have a finished basement  something unheard of in the rest of my family  except my parents never had one either  .  br    br   the standouts in this show are gandolfini  as a ruthless gangster on antidepressants  falco  who is brilliant as his wife  and bracco as the tortured jennifer . but everyone is excellent . if you can take the violence and the language  this is a great show  an unrelenting portrait of new jersey mob life .

1638 ===> the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever  so naturally my expectations were through the roof  and yet the show surpassed them . i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds  but this is so much more .    hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia  action stories  but also to be a great family drama  a shocking character study  a laugh  out  loud comedy  a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil  and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one . david chase  s epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more  and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection  paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away .  br    br   realism is present when it is needed  but chase  s decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for  dream episodes  and the like only adds more layers to the series . chase   along with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter  future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectively   turns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i  ve seen on tv .  br    br   james gandolfini domineers the show as tony  one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever . tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture  but he defies the other half entirely  and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr . melfi  lorraine bracco  with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show   we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect .  br    br   edie falco matches the power of gandolfini  s performance as tony  s wife carmela . from her mixed feelings about tony  s lifestyle  to her suspicions about murders  to her torment over tony  s cheating  to her own thoughts about infidelity  carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout  seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non  mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world . scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television .  br    br   the supporting cast is almost as phenomenal  and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons  somehow without any redundancies . nancy marchand steals the show as tony  s overbearing mother livia  an insight into tony  s personality problems and panic attacks . the familiarity of marchand  s incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far . michael imperioli is christopher  tony  s protg  whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed . drea de matteo plays christopher  s girlfriend adriana  and is so well  meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christopher  s career . tony sirico is paulie  introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic  but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show  and nobody plays true anger better than he . and that  s just the tip of the iceberg .  br    br   familiar faces such as peter bogdanovich  jon favreau  ben kingsley  lauren bacall  will arnett  nancy sinatra  david strathairn  robert patrick  hal holbrook  burt young  and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show  while names as notable as joe pantoliano  steve buscemi  and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series . there are    great characters with powerful arcs  and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show .  br    br   comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series  which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough  the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered . the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall  and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows  most of which i disagree with  .  br    br   whether you love or hate the ending  or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself . the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history . there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show  so if you  re thinking of watching something else instead  do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit .

1639 ===> i have heard a lot about this film  with people writing me telling me i should see it  as i am a fan of extremely bloody  gory movies . i got my hands on it almost right away  but one thing or another always kept me from watching it  until now . i would have been better off not remembering i even had it .  br    br   this movie was atrocious . the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was . i know it was a story by clive barker and all  and no i have not read that story  but it appears to me that if you haven  t then you will be  as i was  completely clueless and utterly disappointed .  br    br   the film begins good enough  the actors are convincing  the story interesting . the first scene is bloody  a great way to catch your attention . i thought the blood looked a bit bad  but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on . i was wrong .  br    br   the blood and effects are so horrible  it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that  for instance  someone could knock a person  s head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer . wtf  cgi blood  did they even use any  real  blood at all  my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film    unbelievable acts of dismemberment  eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off  does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies     too  dark scenes  every scene is either an odd yellow color  or in hidden in shadows  . . . it just gets worse and worse . i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake . there  s just too much . add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial  killer movie turns into some demonic  supernatural  monster movie at the end . . . no thank you  it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway  ok  with a conspiracy theory thrown in  and an overzealous photographer . maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant  plausible  doable . . . and a lot better i think than the  real  story . that could have and should have worked . instead it became a  creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you  and unless you read the book  well . . . you just won  t ever understand it  fiasco . tragic  what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential . if you like mindless fake blood and gore  you  ll love this . but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it . stay away  far  far away .  

=======================================================================================================

1640 ===> this was a terrible film . there was no story line whatsoever . to top it all off  when they couldn  t explain the blood and gore  the only good part  . . . they threw in a few aliens  i hate when directors  or whatever  run out of ideas and then blame the aliens  watch this film if you like . but don  t say i didn  t warn you . two things how could vinny say  welcome  when he didn  t have a tongue  its a pity mr jones didn  t have a bigger role . second thing that bugged me  why were we shown vinny jones  boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid  then these have no further role . why not  i don  t like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever . in short . bad story . i wouldn  t waste my time  wish i  d have watched mirrors instead .  

=======================================================================================================

1641 ===> well . . . easily my favourite tv series ever . call me a walking mail clich but include violence  mafia  sex  gambling  drugs etc . on a show and you  re already winning points on in my book . combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you  ve ever seen on the small screen  add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind  and a few brains a long the way  and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with .  br    br   above all stand two actors  james gandolfini as tony soprano  and edie falco as his wife carmela . . . as for gandolfini  he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express  if you haven  t seen him as tony yet see it now   br    br   i can go on and on and on about every character in the show  the psychological brilliance  the gripping scenes etc . but you wouldn  t be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld  that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more .  

=======================================================================================================

1642 ===> the sopranos stands out as an airtight  dynamic exploration of american life  and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money . by setting the story in the milieu of the underworld  david chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt  low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post  modern era .  br    br   every character represents a facet of american industry . tony soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff  torn between familial duty and a need to keep his  business  on an even keel . the convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward . the characters of christopher  paulie  and bobby reflect the loyal  but self  serving underlings present in every enterprise  who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit . with the character of ralph  joe pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath  a twisted businessman who  s flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power . and dominic chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old  guard  which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up  and  comers to deflect blame .  br    br   though abrasive and occasionally disturbing  the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama .  br    br   ps a good companion piece to chase  s series would be the shield  another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting .  

=======================================================================================================

1643 ===> i am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this  i haven  t seen such a bad movie for years . omg this was a really bad movie . splatter  is not enough to describe the unnecessary  nearly funny  blood scenes  . if you didn  t like hostel  or wolf creek or halloween       . . well this is   time worse . the story remind me rl stine goosebumps .   br    br   i can  t tell about the acting since the script was so terrible . clich all the time .  why i must write   lines  i never understood this .   br    br   here comes spoilers  br    br   the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro . we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice . actually those people are just missing . and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery  well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy  and as usual no one believes him  what a surprise  in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher

1644 ===> one hour  eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame . that was right after hopalong  chris lybbert  drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse . i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy  great bar   gimmick which didn  t translate into anything at all . obviously  the name coppola in the credits couldn  t do anything to guarantee success here  even with more than one listed .  br    br   if you make it to the end of the film  you  ll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did . what exactly was the hook with the gloves  what  s up with the rodeo scenario  who was the stranger supposed to represent  why did they make this film   br    br   i could probably go on but my energy  s been drained . look  there  s already a western called  the gunfighter  from     with a guy named gregory peck as the title character . watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad . that one i can recommend .  

=======================================================================================================

1645 ===> i can  t add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here  great acting  balanced writing  multi  faceted characters  a great anti  hero in tony  great commentary on millennial american life . the integral use of psychiatry coupled with tony  s mother issues are especially fresh and humorous . several other characters add a lot of depth  hesh  s interesting history as an outsider muscling in  ralphie  s total irredeemable viciousness  chris  dual desires in life  and so on .  br    br   i have to dig into some of the criticisms however  especially the  it glorifies violence  belittles italian  americans  one . most of the writers and actors are italian  american  would they attack themselves  there are several positive italian  american characters  artie bucco the chef  dr . melfi and her family and the cusamanos next door to the sopranos . indeed  dr melfi  s ex  husband notes in season  that only a tiny minority of italian  americans have ever had mob connections  certainly smaller than the proportion of african  americans involved in crime  dare i say it . in both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes  .  br    br   most of the characters don  t really choose the life they have family background or circumstances largely corner them into it . outsiders  even of italian stock  who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends  matthew and his friend in season   for example . if you criticise this show  i assume frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist  or will  grace made you want to go homosexual  presumably you won  t listen to rap music that discusses gangs  or r  n  b which discusses promiscuity  or rock music which discusses drugs  or any other combination   people aren  t as stupid as some of you make out . . . .  br    br   not everything is perfect however . a lot of characters have only appeared once  when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes  tracee the dancer  meadow  s friend ally  uncle junior  s ladyfriend  supposedly for   years until they split in season   .  

=======================================================================================================

1646 ===> the sopranos is perhaps the most mind  opening series you could possibly ever want to watch . it  s smart  it  s quirky  it  s funny  and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can  t resist watching . the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters  set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families . for most of the time  you really don  t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back  or buy them lunch .  br    br   further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities  these are dangerous men  most of them murderers  but by god if you don  t love them too . i  ve laughed at their wisecracks  been torn when they  ve made err in judgement  and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal .  br    br   the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show  s subtext  people aren  t always as they seem  and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds .  br    br   if you haven  t already  you most definitely should .  

=======================================================================================================

1647 ===> do not bother to waste your money on this movie . do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you . if you must see a movie this weekend  go see batman again .  br    br   the script was horrible . perfectly written from the random horror movie format . given a place in confined spaces  a madman with various weapons  a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together  and an innocent and overly curious  yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend . mix together  add much poorly executed gore  and what the hell  let  s put some freaks in there for a little  spin  to the plot .  br    br   the acting was horrible  and the characters unbelievable  borat was more believable than this .  br    br   spoilerand can someone please tell me how a butcher  s vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch    i  m in the army . we need that kind of stuff for ourselves .  br    br    out of    and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can .  

=======================================================================================================

1648 ===> wow  how bad can it get . this was seriously bad . not in terms of the gore  which was mainly laughable cgi  but in acting  atmosphere and direction .  br    br   the story was dreadful  the character arc of the main lead was a total joke . within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones  he starts to become  haunted  to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend . um . . . are all new york photographers this childish  suggestible and weak  his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever  and by the very end you  ll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable  and totally absurd twist his character takes .  br    br   the gory moments were clearly just a weak  low  self  esteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon  all cgi  blood yet no real emotion whatsoever . these parts were unintentionally funny  and distracting by their self  consciousness  wacky camera angles etc .  br    br   overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea . what could have had atmosphere  until the stupid monsters at the end  is ruined in favour of  look at me  style self  conscious directing . this film wasn  t made for and audience  it was made for a cv  a deeply selfish motive .  

=======================================================================================================

1649 ===> i  ve only watched the first series on dvd  but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino  like script . the series is as good as goodfellas and casino  and almost as good as the godfather  hence not a       and far better than any of guy ritchie  s efforts . although there  s plenty of action  some of it pretty bloody  the story is character driven . even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines e . g . the priest  s relationship  or lack of  with carmilla and the restaurateur  s wife  and christopher and his dimwit friend  who didn  t last very long  a darwin award nominee     br    br   apart from the plot  the script and the acting  the other reasons i liked it  br    br    . it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce .  . the music .  . it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems .  

=======================================================================================================

1650 ===> it probably isn  t fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten  but oh well . . . . . . .  br    br   from a standpoint of acting  how could any actor fail with these characters  each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life . tony soprano  while a mob  capo  and suffering from mental illness  still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive . each of his men  you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism . it definitely brings out a sort  nosey  side in each and every viewer  and i include myself in this   br    br   while some above don  t care for bracco  i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas . she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason  that makes him decent  that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long  if ever . she is simply put  his savior .  not speaking in religious tones   br    br   but the knockout performance here is without doubt  edie falco . to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series   oz  and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress . she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress  something only actresses like merle streep can get away with . a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles . but as i have mentioned before  with a characters a strong as these  how can any actor fail   br    br   livia  s strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself . she is a survivor  as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors . she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband  s business  yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey . she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himself .  br    br   all in all  the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january     to see the next season . this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series . it was what brought the larry sanders show  sex and the city  dream on  and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them . too much space in between seasons and very sporadic . until then  i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled .  

=======================================================================================================

1651 ===> i was never so bored in my life . hours of pretentious  self  obsessed heroin  addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems . it  s like watching lizards molt . even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy . if you have insomnia  rent this .  

=======================================================================================================

1652 ===> one previous reviewer called this film  pure visual joy  i am wondering if s  he saw the same film that i did .  high art  had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since  seven  . one can almost forgive sheedy and mitchell for the clich of going to a bb for their first time . of course  before they do that  one has to watch opium  den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit . not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types  the girlfriend  boyfriend at start  who are well aware they  re going to be thrown over sometime in the next    minutes or so . the movie also states that the sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now . what did she do  retire at age twenty   

=======================================================================================================

1653 ===>   the godfather    citizen kane    star wars    goodfellas  none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of  the sopranos  . each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity  completely and utterly three dimensional . we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly  despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs . evil  he is evil . soprano is the most provocative  intricate  and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history . if you  re in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer  and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment  watch  the sopranos  . i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season   and not want to continue with the series . each season is completely brilliant in its own way . dvds are essential to anybody  s collection  of out   

=======================================================================================================

1654 ===> not only do the storylines in  the sopranos  engage audiences from all over  but i think  for me at least  what brings the viewers back is the acting .  not even you  gary  can dispute that claim  james gandolfini  who plays the lead  man  tony soprano  has become  in this viewer  s opinion  one of the  hollywood elites  as far as acting in a television series goes . i wouldn  t go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino  or at least  not just yet . he  however  does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano . in the years since      gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor  mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos  that today he is considered to be among the best in the business . and it  s not just him .  the sopranos  fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco  edie falco  michael imperioli  dominic chianese  and the late nancy marchand who played tony  s dreadful mother . at this point in the show  s existence  it  s being considered a cult  classic and rightfully so . the first two seasons were extraordinary . violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner  but without a doubt  extraordinarily done . the third season was great  but didn  t quite live up to the hype of seasons  and  . season   which wrapped up right before new  years  was the weakest season yet  or at least  in my opinion it was  . despite a dry  spell  i still found it  season  of  the sopranos   to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that  s saying a lot because lately i  ve been noticing a trend in good new television shows . examples of this six feet under  the shield  curb your enthusiasm  and oz  which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year  . to get back to my point though  to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year  no less  is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers .  the sopranos  ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit . to close  i  d like to say   the sopranos  is the real deal folks . for the average mature viewer    and above  who enjoys drama and doesn  t mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity  you might want to check out  the sopranos  if you get the chance . trust me in that it will be well worth the time .  

=======================================================================================================

1655 ===> spooks is enjoyable trash  featuring some well directed sequences  ridiculous plots and dialogue  and some third rate acting .  br    br   many have described this is a uk version of      and one can see the similarities .  br    br   the american version shares the weak silly plots  but the execution is so much slicker  sexier and i suspect  expensive .  br    br   some people describe weak comedy as  gentle comedy  .  br    br   this is gentle spy story hour  the exact opposite of anything created by john le carre .  br    br   give me smiley any day .  

=======================================================================================================

1656 ===> this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it  the fast  moving story  an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths  etc . funny thing is  you probably couldn  t make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but  white  as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police .  br    br   nonetheless  woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players  is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes .  br    br   snipes had a lot of funny put  down lines  providing much of the humor . the bad part of the film  which doesn  t bother a lot of people  is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters . that includes woody  s girlfriend  played by rosie perez . there are no really clean  nice people in this movie . for that reason  i can  t honestly recommend the film  at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity  

=======================================================================================================

1657 ===> there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly  one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building . each character unfolds more and more each series . also each series has an array of different  small time characters  as well as the main . a good example of a character  who was only in three episodes  who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick . every little detail builds the perfect tv series . the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano  james gandolfini  who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two . the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable . whilst tony runs things with capos paulie  tony sirico  and silvio  steve van zant  his nephew christopher  michael imperioli  looks for a promotion . every episode also features tony  s other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano  edie falco  . on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano  dominic chianese  is trying to get what he can out of tony  s businesses despite being under house arrest . all the acting is powerful and characters complex  but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who  is  tony soprano . also michael imperioli who plays christopher  representing the younger        generation in crime . if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed  such as the wire and dexter . so the sopranos is definitely the godfather  goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv  

=======================================================================================================

1658 ===> this is not  so bad that it is good   it is purely good  for those who don  t understand why  you have the intellect of a four year old  in response to a certain comment . . .  anyways  killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself  a parody of you  and a parody of me . it is the single most genius text in cinematic history . i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa . it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard . i write scripts and this movie single  handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me  the likes of which we have never seen . it can only be taken in portions . . . its sort of exploitive . . . by now i  m just trying to take up the ten line minimum . my comment ended a while ago . hopefully it works when i submit it now .  

=======================================================================================================

1659 ===> the closing song by johnny rivers was the only great thing about this movie . unfortunately that is all the positive i can say about this western movie . i have to write  more lines for my comments to be posted  but there is more than  lines of awful in this western . i am not sure if the movie was a tribute to hopa along  or just a spoof . the hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic . not realistic at all . a lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic  but the shooting scenes were a joke . a previous commentator thought this movie was great  and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush . this was not a democratic or republican western . it was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially . i wonder if it made any money . at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students . if that was the case  then it was a great movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1660 ===> you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of  jeopardy   .  br    br   the saddest thing about white men can  t jump is that it had tremendous potential . for several years  i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film racial tensions were high  and basketball meant everything to everyone . a film about the members of this  basketball culture  could have been very interesting  but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men can  t job left something to be desired .  br    br   the movie  s sequence of events is cyclical . first  billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball . he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend and the process is repeated . most stories build up to a climax of some kind  but the  climax  i saw was just another sequence in this repetition  this case being  billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball   .  br    br   in order for a plot to develop  some dilemma must be resolved and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well . apparently the writers of white men can  t jump forgot this rule  as the plot can be summarized as  billy needs to pay the bills .  i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies  but   i  m sorry   this was just plain awful . i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment .  br    br   despite all this  white men can  t jump is a successful film . apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them . others  i  m sure  were lured by the big names playing the leading roles . this leaves me to wonder  if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors  and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse  would anyone have bothered watching this movie  i really don  t think so .  br    br   i  ll give this movie two stars out of ten the extra star is for the  jeopardy   scene  which kept me awake for a few minutes . thanks  trebek .  

=======================================================================================================

1661 ===> as a guy who has seen all the seasons  i can say that jg constantly surprises me . i mean  after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster  u thought to yourself ok he is a good actor and he can get into a gangster  s skin . but after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life  i mean i could almost feel the pain he  made  us believe he was going through . i was so touched by his performance that i immediately thought at robert de niro  marlon brando and al pacino . these guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more . but nowadays they are either old or dead  brando  and it  s ok that they make less movies and their performances are  lighter  than they used to be . i can  t wait to see gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role . can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance   

=======================================================================================================

1662 ===> when we started watching this series on cable  i had no idea how addictive it would be . even when you hate a character  you hold back because they are so beautifully developed  you can almost understand why they react to frustration  fear  greed or temptation the way they do . it  s almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of christopher  s learning curves .  br    br   i can  t understand why adriana would put up with christopher  s abuse of her  verbally  physically and emotionally  but i just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior . carmella has a dream house  endless supply of expensive things  but i  m sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband  or maybe not . that  s why i watch .  br    br   it doesn  t matter how many times you watch an episode  you can find something you missed the first five times . we even watch episodes out of sequence  watch season  on late night with commercials but all the language  ae with language censored  reruns on the movie network   whenever they  re on  we  re there . we  ve been totally spoiled now .  br    br   i also love the malaprop  s .  an albacore around my neck  is my favorite of johnny boy . when these jewels have entered our family vocabulary  it is a sign that i should get a life . i will when the series ends  and i have collected all the dvd  s  and put the collection in my will .  

=======================================================================================================

1663 ===> i  ll say this much   this director is all about raw images . . . things most of us are not ready to confront head  on . images of sex  suicide  murder  and people  relieving themselves  are constantly bombarding the viewer  which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release . although i don  t think that i could ever see this movie again  i will say that the director does have a good eye . there were some really nice shots and  picture moments  in the film  the fans  the wire fish in their hair   but the story left me needing more  strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves  what the heck did we just see    .  br    br   note if you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily . . . don  t see this film .  

=======================================================================================================

1664 ===> is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant  life  spanning testimonial of  spring  summer  fall  winter and spring   the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite  nearly silent  heartbreaking longing of   iron   the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of  the coast guard  and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all  characters and viewers alike  to experience redemption in  samaritan girl   i just cannot seem to find him in this film .  br    br   oh  sure  kim  s nature motif is still present . the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters . yes  it  s kim ki duk  all right . kim even describes the film as  beautiful  in an interview included in the dvd  s special features . but i  m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation .  br    br   what is beautiful about angry  potty  mouthed prostitutes  lustful  violent and potty  mouthed fishermen  a covetous mute merchant  explicit animal torture  sequences of self  mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality  these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film . if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater  this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material . it has been favorably compared to  audition  by japanese director takashi miike  much to kim  s satisfaction   but aside from some astonishingly good performances  especially given what they had to work with  by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk  i find little reason to recommend this film . i have not seen  audition   but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of  the isle .  its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic . its sex is not pornographic  but passionless and masochistic . characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot . its point is either non  existent or  i will admit  lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand .  br    br   the only beauty is in the cinematography  which is classic kim fog  shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake  mountainous terrain dominating the background  and an imaginative and playful use of color . at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room . some touches  like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes  are intriguing . but as a film  this effort is downright confusing and  in the end  offensive to the senses  not necessarily to sensibilities . one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film  making in the trash heap of his past  for we know he is capable of so much more .  

=======================================================================================================

1665 ===> the sopranos             br    br   number   television show of all time  br    br   everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn  t go past a pilot episode . the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time .  br    br   james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss  tony soprano  accompanied by a stellar cast . edie falco is superb as the worrying  loving upper  middle class mother tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious  greying consiglieri who is often very funny .  br    br   while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian  americans as mafiosi  and to an extent this is undeniable  i can see so many positives from the show . the portrayal of strong family values  friendships  love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters  yes . furthermore  other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism  social inequality and injustice  homosexuality  drugs etc . this is no shallow  dull show about tough guys and violence . it has so much more . many of the issues we see on the show are very real .  br    br   the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters  lives  which makes the whole thing more interesting .  br    br   credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini  for envisioning  television  s most complex and enigmatic character .  br    br   simply exceptional .  br    br         

=======================================================================================================

1666 ===> what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude   the sopranos  has literally redefined television as we know it . it has broken all rules  and set new standards for television excellence . everything is flawless  the writing  directing  and for me  most of all  the acting . watching this show you  ll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real . the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano  or any character . this show is also very versatile . some people don  t watch the show because it  s violent  it  s not all about the violence  it  s about business  family  and many deeper things that all depend on what you  as a fan see . for me  i don  t like when people refer to the show  a show about the mafia . for me  it  s a show about family . a family who  through generations  happen to be apart of the mob . overall this is a masterpiece of a show . this is what television should be . right here . complex characters from stunning acting  magnificent story lines from brilliant writing  and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together  a show that defines excellence  and dares to be different .

1667 ===> hey look  deal with it  there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black america than this . although i think this story is weak  my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story  which i have mentioned  blows .  br    br   this was made in the mid     s and is horrible in the music  score department . it  s funny to see oprah as a latter  day crack  whore type .  br    br   the scene where bigger stuffs elizabeth mcgovern into the incinerator . pure classic cinema . first off  i don  t care how drunk you are  you will react to     f degree flame  no matter how bad your acting  . but they really milked that scene . . . it was comical . i  ll tell you what though  i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth mcgovern burn in a faux death she annoys me .

1668 ===> of all the movies i  ve seen  this one rates almost at the bottom  haunted mansion  nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom .  it is hasty  the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted . of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer  s door . the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous  and illogical . oprah gives a palatable appearance as  bigger  s  mom  but is not nearly at her potential . other famous performers also seem to be at their worst . the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur . in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted . one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk . now the family he  s working for are not against blacks  but he thinks they are . so when he comes home he puts her to bed  but she begins caterwauling . the blind mother  yes  hears this  so bigger tries to silence her  but instead smothers her . now fearing he  s really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do   he shoves her into the coal furnace . so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace  the idiot didn  t have the foresight to get rid of the ashes . he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom . if your desperate for a bad movie  this one could do the job  but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th    s and    s or see a good drama  there are a lot better options . avoid this .

1669 ===> i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine . what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in      it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x . of course  at that time x meant maturity . since i was only two years old at the time of the movie  s release  it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then . however  when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film  which included prostitution  the title itself was slang for a male prostitute   homosexuality loneliness physical  and to some extent emotional as well  abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day  i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release . it is worth noting that in the      s  midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r  some of the scenes could almost be rated pg    by today  s standards .  br    br   i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie . jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women . he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women . after being rejected by all the women he has come across  he meets a sleazy con  man named enrico  ratso  rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman . ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager . once again  joe is conned and before long is homeless . however  joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment . without giving away much more of the plot  i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams . i . e . joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health .  br    br   i want to make some comments about the movie itself . first of all  the acting is excellent  especially the leads . although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end  there are some classic scenes . in fact  there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny  i find them amusing . for example  there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over . dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says  hey  i  m walkin  here  i  m walkin  here   i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry . another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso  dustin hoffman  sends joe  jon voight  to a guy named o  daniel . what is amusing is that at first  we think o  daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o  daniel is nothing but a religious nut . in addition to the two scenes i mentioned  i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self  defense  john wayne  you gonna tell me he  s a fag   what i like is the delivery in that scene .  br    br   i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late     s  much of it rings true today . that  s because although the area around   nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years  homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was   years ago . also  many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character . one thing that impresses me about jon voight  s character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie  he had matured a great deal and that ratso  dustin hoffman  s character  was a good influence on him .  br    br   in conclusion  i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie  one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on . for example  there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings . also  what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck  jon voight  s character  and the people who were in his life in texas . even the ending  while i don  t want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie  is rather open  ended .

1670 ===> first i would like to say how great this . it is astounding and sometimes shocking . and to say the least i  m   years old and this is my favorite movie  i can definitely stand a boring film  but this is anything but boring . it is like a trip through humanity . its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece . it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers  voight and hoffman  who build a mutual friendship . joe buck  voight  a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women . soon he meets rico  ratso  rizzo  hoffman   who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent . ratso becomes joe  s  manager  but soon both men can  t find joe a job which results in stealing food . as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is . they can  t get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party . joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso  s dream spot  florida . the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film . from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life .

1671 ===> as good an advert for republicanism as you  re ever likely to see   mayerling  is an everyday story of royal folk in late nineteenth century austria . set during one of europe  s seemingly incessant internal turmoils it concerns itself with the emperor franz joseph  mr james mason   his rebellious son  the crown prince rudolf  mr omar sharif  the empress  miss ava gardner  and various mistresses  secret policemen  spies  extravagantly  uniformed popinjays  gypsies  dancers  wives  soldiers  swans  horses and the bizarre inbred web of european royalty at the time of franz joseph  s austro  hungarian empire . filmed in what the old movie posters used to call  a riot of color  it resembles nothing more than an expensively  dressed but intellectually  challenged production of  the student prince  . mr james mason  wearing a very natty little white number  utilises his all  purpose mittel  european accent whenever he remembers . i am a great admirer of his and i sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing . mr omar sharif  who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful  gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the crown prince . he is utterly unconvincing as a man who  in the movie at least  cut a swathe through the distaff side of the austrian aristocracy . with his well  buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms . as a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk  leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes . unhappily married  he falls in love with a commoner .  forbidden love  is one of the movie  s come  ons . as she is played by the most uncommon miss catherine deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there . miss deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it  particularly in the sequence set at the ballet . now i love ballet as much as the next man  but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time  a more cynical critic might consider it to be  padding  . rudolf  s mother  the empress is played by miss ava gardner . she gives the part some good old american oooomph  making her a bit like  auntie mame   but it  s done with undeniable style . rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother  i  ll put it no more strongly than that . the only performance worth watching is that of mr james robertson justice as sir lancelot spratt  sorry  edward  prince of wales . he is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it  s a joy to behold . i waited vainly for him to ask rudolf the immortal question  what  s the bleeding time   . i am not qualified to dispute  mayerling   s historical accuracy  but  in my opinion  everything else about it is risible . it is a ruritanian opera buffa without the tunes to send you home from the theatre whistling .  

=======================================================================================================

1672 ===> watch the     version . as personally annoying i find charles boyer  s voice  he  s more of a match to pay cosmopolitan  depressed rudolf   i mean omar sharif tries but  no   too cute and vibrant . catherine denueve  sp  besides being too old looks nothing like marie   nothing  she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion .  br    br   the only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they  re playing is ava gardner whose appearance as empress elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief  and look up pictures of the empress there  s more than a passing resemblance  as historically  empress elisabeth wasn  t involved that much in rudolf  s life .  

=======================================================================================================

1673 ===> this is a great example of a good  dumb movie . no  it is not high art by any means . nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks . but so what  the killer tomatoes series  four movies and a cartoon series  are basically good  natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks .  br    br   as the title suggests  this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france . in this case  professor gangrene  john astin  s  rd time in the role  has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france . steve lundquist returns as igor  a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long  lost true king of france . obviously he also plays the aforementioned l  l t k of f  happily skewering the french language .  br    br   opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato  like the others  ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon  and his human allies . mark price  recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series  plays a thinly disguised version of himself  passing himself as  michael j fox  as a way to win the girl of his dreams . and angela visser is a dream as marie  gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis . oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career  another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell  now best known as the hapless title subject of  who wants to marry a millionaire    . like co  creator john de bello  rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series .  br    br   what can you say about jon de bello  not much  really  except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and  having done that  has apparently dropped into obscurity . john  if you ever see this  thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes .  br    br   the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie . like return of the killer tomatoes  the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew . and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox . this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send  off to the series . okay  the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series  which was also quite clever   but cartoons just aren  t the same .  

=======================================================================================================

1674 ===> jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy  but hoffman  s performance  though reminiscent of his later turn in rainman  is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies . as a portrayal of a new york character  only daniel day lewis  portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable  and day doesn  t give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso .  br    br   it  s typical of hoffman  s way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight . i think hoffman is one of the  or  best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels .  br    br   voight  s buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether  except that ratso pulls him down  pulls him down  but also teaches him  a lot about how to survive and  more importantly  how to live .  br    br   midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself . i think that  as gritty a movie as it is  it has a very beautiful message  that no matter how much a loser you might be  ratso clearly defines  loser    if you can find a way to be true to yourself  you are in possession of the secret of life  and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else .  br    br   i can  t help but compare midnight cowboy to klute  from a few years later  which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape .

1675 ===> despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky  or think he  s a tired relic from the     s  i really had no opinion of the man  save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist  although i could not elucidate any of his theories  and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings . so  stumbling across the dvd of the     documentary noam chomsky rebel without a pause  in a used video store  a film which followed him on a     book tour for his book      i decided to get it  just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person  pro or con  spoke of him . while glad i got the film  my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was  so what  s all the fuss about   br    br   for a man with so many degrees  lauded as  the most important intellectual alive   by the new york times  according to the dvd  s case  there sure was not a lot there  intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate  and i wouldn  t even want to watch what a william f . buckley could do to him . granted  the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere  and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he  d say  rather than being on linguistics  so maybe that  s the reason he came off so badly . but  again  if he is a linguist  and tops in his field  why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise   . even worse are his acolytes  who seem to further insulate the man from reality  by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins . what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film  this much i knew he was generally considered a has been  and pretty much irrelevant intellectually  since the fall of the soviet empire . the film is so poorly structured  and without a narrative thread  that it  s difficult to separate all of the jumble . his wife  carol  as example  apparently gave one interview  which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . she seems a nice enough woman  but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . the lone interesting thing she says is that     was a great thing for the chomskys  for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then .  br    br   not surprisingly  this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . it  s assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this  great man  bears . chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . stylistically  there are no camera movements  no interesting edits  nor any signature touches  and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky  videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that  and slack  jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial  that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . this is really poor film  making by director and editor will pascoe  who in the dvd  s filmmaker statement  shows he  s yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky  s . other than that  one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary  but mere agitprop  and a vanity piece of agitprop  at that  is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer . he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds .  br    br   given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky  s lectures at mcmaster university  in ontario  canada  prior to the american invasion of iraq in      much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era . yes  he makes some good points  here and there  on american media complicity before the war  but he follows them up with sheer lunacy  for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc  and not fully plotted out cabals . as example  he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace  but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . similarly  he claims trilateralists run the world and that people  s fear of crime is yet another cabal  s result . of course  that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers  and all that wasted time and money district attorneys  offices consume . he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades  when castro and company were great sponsors of it  in latin america  asia  and africa  until the soviet union fell . i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species  mixing impregnation centers up in idaho .  br    br   in his simpleminded world without grays  chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco  whom he reviles  are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . in short  chomsky is a man living in the past  in over his head on most issues  and out of his depth intellectually . near this film  s end he warns   be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice   yet one can only laugh  as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn  t like  no matter how barbarous their crimes  and anti  intellectual their posit . please  pause before you waste your time and money on this silly  and already irrelevant  dvd .  

=======================================================================================================

1676 ===> first off  i agree with quite a bit that escapes mr . chomsky  s mouth . his matter  of  fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus . he comes across likable  unassuming  pragmatic . he doesn  t cater to the current political style  obnoxious bi  partisanship  and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right  chastising both  and for good reason .  br    br   unfortunately  the film itself is a dud . in fact  i would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches . watching  rebel without a pause  is no different from watching a speaker on a  am taped segment on cspan . there are no camera movements  no edits  no stylistic touches . there is no story  no narrative .  br    br   technically speaking  the production is strictly amateurish . audio is terrible and inconsistent sometimes we cannot hear noam speak  other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance . when noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her .  br    br   i cannot recommend this film and would say that you  re probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or cd to listen to in the car .  br    br    out of   stars . . . and i  m in a generous mood today .

1677 ===> jon voight plays a man named joe . joe is shook up by a haunting childhood . he has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism . he quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people . he meets a misfit named ratso  dustin hoffman  and the two for a relationship . they go out and work together in helping each other out . they become thieves . the two grow remarkably close and soon can  t live without each other . however  there is something very important that ratso hasn  t told joe  and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together . this is one of the greatest films ever made . it is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other . their story is devastating to watch  but is ultimately important for people to see . it  s one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street . the difference is that this film is from their perspective . their lives are shown to us and it  s devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt  especially if we at one time were one of those people . however  the film doesn  t try to guilt trip you . instead  it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling . it is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman . the lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty  gritty  and ugly life and it  s sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of joe in this film does . what startles me the most about this film was that it came out in      and it has stood the test of time perfectly . today  s audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in     . the film was rated x  but what i notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest  realistic  and effective way . anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous  awkward  and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn  t shy away from any of that . the sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be . movies that were x rated such as midnight cowboy  a clockwork orange  greetings  last tango in paris  and fritz the cat all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an r rating today . the sex scenes in midnight cowboy will seem quite strong but they certainly aren  t sexy . they are not graphic  but they are realistic  and that  s what people should keep in mind when they view this film . the course language that is used in the film  particularly the word  fag  is used effectively and is not gratuitous . the violence is very shocking to watch even today  but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler . i  m really glad to see that midnight cowboy is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in      if not more . i can  t recommend this classic enough and i do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten .  br    br   pros  br    br    jon voight and dustin hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch . they have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual . you  ll forget who is playing them within minutes   br    br    beautiful score  br    br    not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today  br    br    fantastic and fast editing job  br    br   cons  br    br    for mature audiences only  br    br    the opening scenes are well done  but they could be just a little stronger .

1678 ===> although i love this movie  i can barely watch it  it is so real . so  i put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers . i remembered it vividly  but just wanted to see if i could find something i hadn  t seen before . . . . . . . . i didn  t that  s because it  s so real to me .  br    br   another  user  wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary . i  m all for that  it  s absolutely obvious that most of these people who  ve made comments about  midnight cowboy  may not have been born when it was released . they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in  at a later time . i  ll be just as ruinously frank i am    years  old . if you  re familiar with some of my other comments  you  ll be aware that i was a professional female  impersonator for   of those years  and also have appeared in film  you  d never recognize me  even if you were familiar with my night  club persona . do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film  you bet i do   . . . .  br    br   . . . . and am not the least bit ashamed . if you haven  t run  into some of them  it  s your loss  but  there  s a huge chance you have  but just didn  t know it . so many moms  dads  sons and daughters could surprise you . it should be no secret many actors  actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of  midnight cowboy  . who is to judge  i can name several  current big  time stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities  and weren  t the least bit damaged by their time spent there . i make no judgment  because these are humans  just as we all are  love  courage  kindness  compassion  intelligence  humility you name the attributes  they are all there  no matter what the package looks like .  br    br   the  trivia  about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of  ratzo  is a gem  he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles  how do you think he gets his input  i can also name lots of male  stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money . although the nightclub i last worked in for   years was world  famous and legit  i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our back  street  looking to make a pick  up .  br    br   this should be no surprise today  although it  s definitely action in hollywood and other cities  large and small . wake  up and smell the roses . they smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue .  br    br   some of the  users  thought  joe buck  had been molested by his grandma . although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend  i didn  t find any incidence of that . believe  it  or  not  kids haven  t always had their own rooms  because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going  on in the master  bedroom . whose business  hoffman may have begged for change on the streets  but some of the  users  point  out that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of  midnight cowboy   his actual salary would surprise you . i think he was robbed  no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role  nor that it made him a star for such great work as  deliverance  . he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie . the end of the   s may have been one of the first films to be so open  but society has always been hip .  br    br   i also did not find any homosexuality between  ratzo  and  joe   they were clearly opposites  unappealing to one another . they found a much purely higher relationship  true friendship . if you didn  t understand that at the end of the movie  then you  ve wasted your time .  joe  s  bewilderment  but unashamed devotion was apparent . yes  voight deserved an oscar for this role  one that john wayne could never pull  off  and he was as handsome in his youth .  br    br   hoffman is hoffman  you expect fireworks . he gave them superbly . wayne got his oscar . every character in this film was beautifully defined  if you don  t think they are still around  you are mistaken .  the party    attend some of the  raves  younger people attend . . . . . if you can get in . look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs  you  ll see every outrageous personality .  br    br   brenda viccaro was the epitome of society  s sleek women who have to get down to the nitty  gritty at times . if you were shocked by her brilliant acting  thinking  this isn  t real   look at today  s  ladies  who live on the brink of disrepute . . . . and are admired for it .  br    br   the brutality  joe  displayed in robbing the old guy  unfortunately  is also a part of life . you don  t have to condone it  but it  s not too much different than any violence .  joe  pointedly named his purpose  in that situation  i  d have handed  over the money quicker than he asked for it . that  s one of the scenes that makes this movie a break  through  one which i do not watch . i get heartbroken for both . . . . .  br    br   john schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye  opener  waldo salt didn  t write from clairvoyance . anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history  and should be proud for the honesty of it . perhaps  only in america  can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations  while other movie  makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public . not looking doesn  t mean it isn  t there  give me the truth every time . bravo  to all . . . . . .

1679 ===> except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads  this movie is really  really bad . the cheap production values don  t help . of course  you wouldn  t really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn  t keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with . even for a b  movie genre freak like myself  this movie really sucks .  

=======================================================================================================

1680 ===> this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick . the video is dark and poorly lit . the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed . the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun  filled of course with silver bullets . the acting is as wooden as the characters . the fx are non  existent  lots of extreme close  ups of werewolf jaws and biting . the only thing that is shown is lots of soft  core ta . instead of dropping    for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic  dog soldiers  with sean pertwee .

1681 ===> what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both . there really aren  t many glimpses of hope in this film for either character  but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other .  br    br   this film features jon voight  s finest performance and probably dustin hoffman  s as well . the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns  though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors  including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film . also  for those interested  andy warhol  s apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene .  br    br   if you haven  t seen this movie  it is essential . check it out .

1682 ===>   midnight cowboy  is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason  it really is one of the finest films ever made in america . its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial . no wonder it was a huge success when initially released . but be warned  its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made . the characters are memorable  well  developed  and ultimately tragic . the filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the hollywood ending  something which was basically mandatory by the   s . still  this is why i treasure the years of     to     for american film . its a time when well  made  innovative  and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer . all this was over by the time  star wars  was released .  br    br   the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work . it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing . unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects   midnight cowboy  has aged quite well . its still as powerful now as it was when initially released . the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece . the characters  backgrounds are never fully explained  but the performances make them completely developed . both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic  despite their sometimes reprehensible actions  . plus  being a fan of vintage exploitation films  i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy   nd street .  midnight cowboy  is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made .         

=======================================================================================================

1683 ===> this is only the second time i  ve felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film . the first time was for probably the best movie i  ve ever seen and that was for memento .  br    br   seeing darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to memento  as in the worst film i  ve had the misfortune to see . apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash  pile that it is .  br    br   let  s see  apalling effects  cliched script  bad acting and about   minutes too long . my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad . amazingly i watched it to the end  how i did that i don  t know  avoid     

=======================================================================================================

1684 ===> all the bare chested women in the world couldn  t keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish . with the derisory acting  equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre . it is supposed to be serious  which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke .  br    br   this is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent . avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies instead .  br    br    out of     

=======================================================================================================

1685 ===> midnight cowboy is not for everybody . it  s raw  painful  and realistic but very entertaining . the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances . voight as the texas hustler  joe buck  who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler . he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy . the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women . sadly  buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas . he was raised by his grandmother  sally buck  played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in     from cancer . the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and buck  s characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship . the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job . as the film evolves  buck  s past comes to the surface and it  s haunting but not clear . the film is not for children but compared to today  s films and television programming  midnight cowboy might be more tame . i can  t forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you can  t forget . it  s also a tearjerker of a film  so get your hankies out too .  

=======================================================================================================

1686 ===> hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler  jon voigt  and his lame con  man sidekick  dustin hoffman   soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills .  br    br   a daring film for its time  and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the    s . symbolic of the  end of innocence  in american films  since it was the only x  rated film to win a best picture oscar .  br    br   jon voigt is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body  but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk . befriended by a lame con  man  dustin hoffman   he goes through a series of serio  comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter  ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in florida  a land his friend  ratzo  dreams of living in .  br    br   but even in this final quest  the two are losers . john schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by waldo salt  and john barry  s haunting  midnight cowboy  theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation .  br    br   summing up a true american classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life .  

=======================================================================================================

1687 ===> there isn  t much to say about this film  it is horrible .  br    br   the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent  the story of the hybrid werewolf  s is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there .  br    br   cgi is something you wouldn  t like to see . it so amateurish that it makes me vomit .  br    br   the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras . the gag reel . everything else  just waste of time and money . i hope noone will buy this  this is not even worth renting .  br    br   just stay away of this .  

=======================================================================================================

1688 ===> hopalong cassidy with a horse who is not white  not named topper  go figure   br    br   this travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes  hopalong cassidy . the actor who plays him is young versus old  blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands . will the real hopalong please stand up   br    br   one of the worst movies ever made   believe it or not  by the person who brought us the grandfather saga   

=======================================================================================================

1689 ===> john schlesinger  s  midnight cowboy  is perhaps most notable for being the only x  rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture . this was certainly how i first came to hear of it  and  to be completely honest  i didn  t really expect much of the film . this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible  but somehow i didn  t consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching . this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting  ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack   everybody  s talking  at me  i don  t hear a word they  re sayin    make this film one of the finest explorations of life  naivety and friendship ever released .  br    br   young joe buck  then  newcomer jon voight   dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy  travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler  a male prostitute . women  however  do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services  and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up . during these exploits  joe comes to meet enrico  ratso  rizzo  dustin hoffman   a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money . when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament  ratso offers joe a place to stay  and  working together  they attempt to make  largely dishonest  lives for themselves in the cold  gritty metropolis of new york .  br    br   joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex however  his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman  sylvia miles  twenty dollars . though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent  ratso is just as nave as joe . ratso  with his painful limp and hacking cough  is always assuring himself that  if only he could travel to the warmth of miami  somehow everything would be all right . this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbeck  s classic novel   of mice and men .   br    br   shot largely on the streets of new york   midnight cowboy  is a grittily  realistic look at life in the slums . watching the film  we can almost feel ourselves inside ratso  s squalid  unheated residence  our joints stiff from the aching winter cold . the acting certainly contributes to this ultra  realism  with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society . hoffman  in particular  is exceptional in his role  i  m walkin  here  i  m walkin  here     managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much  lauded debut in      s  the graduate .  both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars  also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was sylvia miles  for an appearance that can  t have been for more than five minutes   though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in  true grit .   midnight cowboy  eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations  including best picture  best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo salt .  br    br    midnight cowboy  is told mainly in a linear fashion  though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joe  s past . rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about  the audience is invited to think about it for themselves  and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing . the achingly  beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope  but a large amount of uncertainty . gritty  thought  provoking and intensely fascinating   midnight cowboy  is one for the ages .  

=======================================================================================================

1690 ===>   midnight cowboy  was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic . you know it  s a classic the moment its insistent theme song   everybody  s talking  starts up on the soundtrack   actually not written for the film   and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck   naked and in the shower  . we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he  s  one helluva stud  who  s to doubt him  this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else  his performance here would still be legendary . as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish  anaconda  is a source of pleasure  .  br    br   the film became famous and infamous almost overnight . it was a crowd  pleaser   even with its downbeat ending   funny and sexy and recognizably  real    it was the tail  end of the sixties and all the characters rang true  . it was also the first  x  rated film to win the oscar as the year  s best picture . adapted   brilliantly   by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main  stream commercial american movie to deal with  taboo  subjects such as homosexuality and drug  taking in a matter  of  fact manner . everyone is recognizably human  warts and all  and everyone is treated sympathetically . voight  s joe buck is an innocent abroad  a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler   a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he  s a cross between a gigolo and a social worker  . but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy  wormy little con  man called  ratso  rizzo   dustin hoffman  fresh from  the graduate  and he  s a revelation   he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe  dream .  br    br   essentially it  s a male love story   though totally platonic   between these two not so unlikely bedfellows . both totally alone  both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other   voight with his physical prowess  hoffman with his street  wise savvy  . they are misfits adrift from the mainstream  tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others . though  straight  voight isn  t beyond a homosexual encounter in a   nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself .  the whole film posits a strangely  christian  attitude  .  br    br   it  s also magnificently acted . while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver  bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers  on  beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger  s direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien  s totally detached eye  view of the american under  belly without rancor and without criticism . on second thoughts  maybe it is a great movie after all .  

=======================================================================================================

1691 ===> man  this movie sucked big time  i didn  t even manage to see the hole thing  my girlfriend did though  . really bad acting  computer animations so bad you just laugh  woman to werewolf   strange clips  the list goes on and on . don  t know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie  and i don  t mean all the naked ladys . . . it  s something about the light or something . . . this could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women  but not because it  s an original movie white a nice plot twist . my final words are don  t see it  it  s not worth the time . if you wanna see it because the nakedness there  s lots of better ones to see   

=======================================================================================================

1692 ===> this is the absolutely worst piece of crap i  ve ever had to watch  actually it was so bad that i just had to watch it     br    br   the cgi is sooo bad it  s fun  it  s not even close to the shitty cgi animations in spawn  that  s how bad it is  har har har . . .  br    br   i  m amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on dvd  but i guess they  ll get more money out of it that way   cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars .  br    br   it  s so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it .  br    br   see it and laugh   

=======================================================================================================

1693 ===> saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released . had me snifflin  like a baby as i left the theatre  trying not to let anyone see . so  when i saw it again now in     i knew what to expect  the sobs were ready  primed as their required moment approached . thankfully this time i was at home .  br    br   what i hadn  t remembered from my youthful viewing  or perhaps hadn  t noticed because of it  was the technical brilliance of this movie . the use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue . the camera work which seemed to place the viewer  together with the characters in the scene . think of the opening when joe is crossing the street to the diner  the camera pans behind the woman  child sitting on a bench in the foreground  framing the street scene .  br    br   the story itself   the characters  seedy  sad  brutally real . it is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn . then again  joe  ratso could be any of us . must have been    when i saw it . i recall that upon leaving the theatre i was impelled to find the company of friends . all these years later  i  m glad i  m not alone tonight . this is one hell of a great movie .  

=======================================================================================================

1694 ===> midnight cowboy opens with a run down drive in theater with the voice  over of the main character joe buck  jon voight  singing in the shower . he is singing a cowboy song  the very thing he strives to be . joe picks up his humdrum life living in texas and moves it to new york city with the dream of lots of women  and even more money . he dresses as the epitome of the cowboy  but in a cartoonish fashion  not even his friends take him seriously . he begins his journey on the bus to nyc and we can quickly see how diluted joe is through his interactions with the other passengers . this is primarily a story of joe  s realization of the harsh realities of the real world .  br    br   he starts off as a very nave southerner thinking he can make it in nyc just on his good looks . he has no other reason to think otherwise  as they proved helpful in the past we learn this from the many flashbacks he has . in the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical . they are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance  as they are  they are coming out of his past . however  as joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of nyc we see more of his past  which is no longer whimsical but gritty  filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events . this is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted  and her being raped . in one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick . this mirrors the way in which joe himself is falling apart the naivet that he once carried is falling off of him . he and ratso  dustin hoffman  are living in squalor  and barely able to get food to eat joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks  that there is a gritty underbelly of new york that he didn  t envision . his subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out .  br    br   ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to joe  but in an opposite way ratso is joe  s foil . joe is a handsome  strong man who  for the most part  has a good outward appearance . ratso  on the other hand  from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite . he is short  dark  and always coated with a sheen of sweat . he understands how the world works  that it is unforgiving  and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail just as his father did . they are living in the same world  the same apartment even  but they understand things on a completely different level .  br    br   the theme of alienation  one that is common of this era  is very apparent in this film . neither joe nor ratso fit into the culture surrounding them . joe feels trapped in texas and moves to nyc where he is still very much an outsider . ratso  living in the cold of nyc  wishes to move to sunny florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life . even though this is his ideal  in the fantasy we get from ratso  s perspective  it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society . in said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him  he is yet again an outsider  alienated from society .  br    br   it is not until the end that the gap between joe and ratso begins to narrow . joe resorts to violence he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for florida for himself and ratso . on the journey we see joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film . he is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to florida for vacation . he dresses ratso the same way he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering  but it is to no avail . upon ratso  s death on the bus  their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders . even in this new culture they have entered  they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film . despite the ratso  s death  and joe  s continued alienation  the film ends with the hope that joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in nyc . midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society  and alienation  with stellar performances by both voight and hoffman .  

=======================================================================================================

1695 ===> this flick reminded me of those lame  erotic thrillers  i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was   . i  d label this flick softer  core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder . there is  however  a ton of nudity  the opening scene is in a strip club  we see kane hodder  s keester  or at least a stunt butt  and then an inexplicable   minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munster  s for a costume .   year old boys rejoice .  br    br   other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i  ve seen in years . the shots look like fmv  s from the video game resident evil in terms of quality . the wolf is too bad to be explained and  despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way  way too many times .  br    br   the plot and acting make no sense . there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid  werewolves  the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do  look human  change to a wolf an kill people . the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can  t find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches . once more  this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched  met or even saw as best i can tell . the mate doesn  t know she  s a werewolf and she  s fighting the transformation or something .  br    br   you  d think it  d be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but  well they did . want quality low  end werewolf  ism  go rent dog soldiers want a ton of ta this is your flick .  

=======================================================================================================

1696 ===> where to start   . . . i feel . . . violated  thats right  violated  i just spent  .  hrs of my life   .  hrs that i could have spent doing something more useful  like watching paint dry  on this so called horror flick .  br    br   its not scary  its not funny  its not dramatic  its no action  its nothing . . .  br    br   its predictable  its boring  its tragic . . .  br    br   i might come of a bit harsh here  but watch this movie and you will feel the same way . . . or . . . no  don  t watch it . . . unless you want to feel violated also .  

=======================================================================================================

1697 ===> fascinating downer about a would  be male hustler in new york city forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con  man . extremely bleak examination of modern  day moral and social decline  extremely well  directed by john schlesinger  who never topped his work here  and superbly acted by jon voight and dustin hoffman . packs quite a punch overall  yet the  fantasy  scenes   some of which are played for a chuckle   are mildly intrusive  as is the  mod  drug party . the relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental  yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy  and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than schlesinger . originally x  rated in      and the winner of the best picture oscar screenwriter waldo salt  who adapted james leo herilhy  s book  and schlesinger also won statues .     from   

=======================================================================================================

1698 ===> it  s not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered  but      s  midnight cowboy  is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time . directed by john schlesinger and written by waldo salt  the movie seems to be a product of its time  the late      s when american films were especially expressionistic  but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period . the film  s cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in ang lee  s  brokeback mountain  .  br    br   the meandering plot follows joe buck  a naive  young texan who decides to move to manhattan to become a stud  for  hire for rich women . full of energy but lacking any savvy  he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances . he meets a cynical  sickly petty thief named  ratso  rizzo  who first sees joe as an easy pawn . the two become dependent on one another  and rizzo begins to manage joe . things come to a head at a psychedelic  drug  infested party where joe finally lands a paying client . meanwhile  rizzo becomes sicker  and the two set off for florida to seek a better life . this is not a story that will appeal to everyone  in fact  some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures  yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic .  br    br   in his first major role  jon voight is ideally cast as he brings out joe  s paper  thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities . as rizzo  dustin hoffman successfully upends his clean  post  college image from  the graduate  and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to joe . the honesty of their portrayals is complemented by schlesinger  s film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the times square district at the time . the director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character  s fragile psyches . credit also needs to go to salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story . the other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters  including brenda vaccaro as the woman joe meets at the party  sylvia miles as a blowsy matron  john mcgiver as a religious zealot and barnard hughes as a lonely out  of  towner .  br    br   the two  disc     dvd package contains a pristine print transfer of the     restoration and informative commentary from producer jerome hellman since unfortunately neither schlesinger nor salt are still living . there are three terrific featurettes on the second disc  a look  back documentary   after midnight reflections on a classic   years later   which features comments from hellman  hoffman  voight and others  as well as clips and related archive footage such as voight  s screen test  controversy and acclaim   which examines the genesis of the movie  s initial  x  rating and public response to the film and a tribute to the director   celebrating schlesinger  .

1699 ===> i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting  instead of watching this  movie  . . . anything will do  even stare at the walls is better .  br    br   and because i have to write minimum   lines of text  i tell you also is a low budget movie  bad acting  no name actors  a stupid mutt as the wolf  and so on . . . also the story brings nothing new  the special effects are made in the    s style .  br    br   the movie is almost as bad as the movie  megalodon  .  br    br   so have fun     not watching this movie   

=======================================================================================================

1700 ===> this is the prime example of low budget  winning over what would be a good story line . let  s bring back samaire armstrong  having seen her work on the o . c . i know she can do better   then find a better script and budget .  br    br   the special effects were so bad  and mostly badly computer generated  that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on  screen . and samaire armstrong  s  alert   changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to change  final fantasy  s humans  as well as pixar  s made these laughable  think of the figure as a nude barbie doll  .  br    br   the story of was interesting  though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new . as it also got into the balance between evil   maybe  not so evil  and the possible end of human  kind should the two lines mate . the subplot of a  book of werewolf linage  which effected some of the other characters in a spell  like manner for a while was effective  but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past .  br    br   bring in a better script and direction  and i  d come back again .

1701 ===> joe buck  jon voight  decides he  s going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city . the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly  tutti  fruttis .  wide  eyed  he comes to new york city  not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences  one worse than the other . in the middle of that chaos  he meets and befriends rico  ratso  rizzo  dustin hoffmann   a homeless  looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building .  br    br   there isn  t much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck  s plights in the city  but also inter  cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi  psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie  jennifer salt  who was gang  raped  his abandonment by his mother  and his apparent abuse by his grandmother  who also had a habit of hustling men for money . an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery  everybody  s talking    we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city  the odds are high he won  t and will end up working for pennies in a dead  end job   shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself . we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this .  br    br   a dark story of dashed hopes  john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the   s  and at the center  the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life . there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers   ratso  s reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this   but this is essentially a buddy film  one that manages to survive  literally  to the death  and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed  older  wiser .

1702 ===> at the time i recall being quite startled and amused by this movie . i referred to it as the most important movie i  d seen in ten years  and found myself bumping into people who said similar things .  br    br   bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook . and she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had  into a corrosive  adult world  view . the two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers .  hi skip . i wish you weren  t my brother so i could  you    br    br   bernhards search for herself after returning to la from new york  results in the immersive trying  on of various personas  all of which fit poorly  for our amusement  but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a  black imperative  values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her .  it  s been a while . nina simone comes to mind . and she has an impressive  solidly  built black lover in the movie  a pretty black girl attends the shows  and seems to be authorizing sandra  s faux  blackness  but ultimately rejects her .  br    br   just as catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for christ  here sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection . it  s the only value system implicated in the films world  outside of bernhards arty confusion .  br    br   for a nation whose chief issues are racism and money  it  s refreshing to see one of the  topics dealt with in an atypical way .  

=======================================================================================================

1703 ===> in this day and age of incredible special movie effects  this one was a sore disappointment . the actors seemed stiff and uninspired  as was the dialogue . westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days  but movies like  silverado  prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one . considering that  it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing  much less creating such a weak film as this one . if you love and are looking for a good western  keep looking   

=======================================================================================================

1704 ===> i watched this film alone  in the dark  and it was full moon outside  i didn  t do it in purpose  it just happened in this way . so all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me   well  it didn  t  in fact i wanted to shut off the dvd player after only  minutes  but i thought come on give it a chance  unfortunately i did . the acting was awful  the only one with some decent acting was samaire armstrong . the plot is not original  if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before . some scenes didn  t make sense at all  and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer  the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie . the  scary  scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the   s when there was not enough technology  yet some good movies were made back then  i was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie  i thought couldn  t they put some money in this and make it decent    i couldn  t agree more with the ratings that the movie got  it is also my rating for it   out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

1705 ===> the only reason i knew of midnight cowboy was because it was in the afi critic  s top    . for a top    it is not a very well known movie indeed  i had to look hard to find a copy  i got the dvd version for about half  price . surprisingly it was only rated m     the uncut version  .  br    br   i doubt many will take notice of this review  more like comment  so i  ll make it brief .  br    br   this is perhaps one of the strangest movies i  ve seen  partly because of the use of montages  artistic filming  very art  house  and the unusual theme . there are many things in the film i still don  t understand  i  ve seen it twice   and it makes for an emotionally confusing film .  br    br   the filming and acting were very good  and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable . the main character is joe buck  a  cowboy  from texas who moves to new york to become a male prostitute . he meets the crippled conman enrico  ratso  rizzo and  of course they become friends going through the usual escapades . what makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different .  br    br   i felt the film didn  t really develop the relationship between buck and enrico rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection  although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic . you probably already know what happens by reading the reviews  but its pretty obvious from the start .  br    br   i personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes . the deprivation of humanity  shown by the darkness of the city streets  the breaking  down tenements  . most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law  a conman  giggolo . etc  yet you can  t help liking them . joe buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic  while we begin to feel pity for ratso later in the film .  br    br   i think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground  breaking for its period . at the time  and even now  it was definitely not a typical movie  quite art  house  . at a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns  musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as midnight cowboy pops up .  br    br   on a personal level  i must say i quite liked the film . the imagery conveyed a dream  like quality . i particularly liked the scene at the party  the music  images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching . however  as a movie for entertainment  s sake it was a bit lacking  not really my style of movie  in thrills . this is a film to be savoured and appreciated  rather than a cheap thrills action flick .  br    br   although i would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film  the characters and their motives were quite interesting . from what i understand from the flashbacks  joe buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother  although it still doesn  t seem to be relevant to the story . he is a happy  go  lucky young stud  who suppresses his darker memories . the religious connotations in the film are also puzzling . some have suggested a homosexual connection between buck and ratso  although i fail to see where they have got the idea from . the theme of homo  sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation  and later in joe buck  s encounter with a lonely old man  but it has little to do with the main story .  br    br   certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade  it has more of a   s feel to it than a   s feel  and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do . while it has a simple  sentimental story to it  disguised by a hard edge  the beauty of the film is in the strange  often psychedelic sequences .  

=======================================================================================================

1706 ===> watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting  directing  cinematography  editing  writing . i was too young to watch it when it was originally released  and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago  but it has absolutely stood the test of time  and i have watched it several times since .  br    br   everything about this film is brilliant  from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman  even though i know this movie well  i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks  or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way  to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences .  br    br   it  s a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren  t prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one . midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools .  br    br         

=======================================================================================================

1707 ===> why bother seeing this movie  if you have great movies to see . it is a total waste of time and money . the movie is so bad that i felt bad for wanting to watching it . everything in it is bad . actors were bad . script was really bad . the story is stupid . and the worst cgi ever . the only good moments were the first   seconds of the movie in the strip club . one interesting thing that  there is a characther that we wish that he dies because  he is so stupid that we get enough of him .  i don  t remember the name but was the boyfriend of the  chosen one  .   br    br   noteif you want to see a good movie  this movie isn  t the right choice .   stars out of    

=======================================================================================================

1708 ===> another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story . within   minutes  the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines  so there is absolutely no mystery  which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense . the only half  way competent actor is killed   minutes into the film  so we  re left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things . low budget films can  t afford expensive special effects  so the cgi portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive  but were at least a valid attempt . the creature suit is terrible  as seen when it falls to the sidewalk  and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes  which aren  t even the red color shown in mirror shots . the dialogue is clumsy and uninspired  with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminator . the last action sequence takes place in a police station  also a rip  off from terminator  with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the darkwolf doesn  t smash into . in the end  the girl calls the hero  a good protector   but he gets both his partners  the original protector  and at least three other civilians  not to mention a dozen cops  all killed without getting a decent shot off  in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun . but here  s the real clincher for bad writing they could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes . instead  they took it into custody     

=======================================================================================================

1709 ===> in my opinion  this is one of the greatest movies ever made in america and it deserved every single award it won and it  s place on the afi top    list  though it  s shamefully too low on the imdb top    list  at only     as of this writing  . if you enjoy acting of the highest calibre  voight and hoffman are a superb match   well  drawn characterizations and inventive direction  editing and cinematography  you  ll love this just as much as i did . schlesinger paints a vivid  always credible picture of the late   s new york city scene and it  s many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality  poverty and hopelessness of   nd street  new york city .  br    br   the filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground new york film movement  and of the city  and are nothing less than dazzling . i  ve seen many ideas  including the rapid  fire editing  the handling of the voice  over flashbacks  the drug  trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror  stolen by other filmmakers .  br    br   the relationship between joe and ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship or having it  s homosexual underpinnings . i think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times  but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life  whether it be sexual or not .  br    br   midnight cowboy is a brave  moving film of magnitude  influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it  s impact over the years  so if you haven  t seen it  you  re really missing out on a true american classic . i recommend this film to everyone .  br    br   score   out of   .

1710 ===> young  handsome  muscular joe buck  jon voight  moves from texas to new york thinking he  ll make a living by being a stud . he gets there and finds out quickly that it isn  t going to be easy   he goes through one degrading experience after another . at the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled  sleazy ratso rizzo  dustin hoffman  . together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to florida . but will they make it   br    br   very dark  disturbing yet fascinating movie . director john schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of nyc and its inhabitants . in that way it  s dated   the city may have been this bad in     but it  s cleaned up considerably by now . he also uses every camera trick in the book   color turning to black  white trippy dream sequences flash forwards flash backs  especially involving a rape   shock cuts weird sound effects . . . you name it . it keeps you disoriented and off center   but i couldn  t stop watching .  br    br   there isn  t much of a story   it basically centers on the friendship between rizzo and buck . there is an implication that they may have been lovers  the final shot sort of shows that  . it  s just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold  cruel  urban jungle .  br    br   this was originally rated x in       the only reason being that the mpaa didn  t think that parents would want their children to see this . nevertheless  it was a big hit with high schoolers  back then x meant no one under    . it also has been the only x rated film ever to win an academy award as best picture . hoffman and voight were up for acting awards as was  mysteriously  sylvia miles who was in the picture for a total of  maybe   minutes  it was eventually lowered to an r  with no cuts  when it was reissued in     .  br    br   also the excellent song  everybody  s talkin   was introduced in this film   and became a big hit .  br    br   a great film    but very dark . i  m giving it a   . don  t see it on commercial tv   it  s cut to ribbons and incomprehensible .  

=======================================================================================================

1711 ===> the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library  and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it   and despite the plethora of tits and ass  it didn  t take long to realize that the fast  forward button was my friend . terrible direction  pedestrian camera work  sporadically bad  to  nearly  passable acting  chintzy effects  and one of the worst screenplays i  ve had the displeasure of seeing brought to life  such as it was  horribly crippled and mutilated  in a long  long time . best laughs actually come from the  making of . . .  featurette  in which the poor saps involved with this hdv mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special  instead of something that won  t be utterly forgotten next week . wait  except for the fact that somehow someone lured tippi  the birds  hedren  of all people  into doing a bit part  along with kane  friday the   th  hodder  how this came to pass  i  ll never know  and to be honest  i don  t really care . watch at your own risk  and don  t say you haven  t been warned . this is film  making at its pretentious  craven worst . it only gets a  from me for having some good  looking naked women  and even then  just barely .

1712 ===> dark wolf  quick review  let  s get right to it this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sht on it . it  s just an awful movie . it  s an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an    s high school drama film . what  s worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf . kane fcking hodder . someone  s trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career . . .  br    br   anyway  former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf  too . it  s kind of a crappy cop drama with the world  s worst looking werewolf in it . but it does have moments of near  rampant nudity . but that  s about all . want to know more  okay  the werewolf is generally an ugly  looking black blur zipping around the screen . and when we  re privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence  we  re presented with something that resembles a full  motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation . the first playstation . the cg animation is really that primitive . only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit .      br    br   www . residenthazard . com

1713 ===> horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn  t always win out over imagination . we all know that killers like freddy  jason  michael and even leatherface shouldn  t be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day . most of us don  t believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains . and let  s hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them . this is where imagination wins out over fact . horror  and most films in general  requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow . this usually isn  t a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c . scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville . but what i do have a problem digesting  without wanting to regurgitate  is when a film has a killer like the one in this film . to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself  but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed . there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is . but the   minutes prior to this point is a well done  suspenseful  blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough . if the film would have offered me a different killer  then i would actually be raving about it . this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film  but believe me  anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me .  br    br   john cassevetes plays dr . sam cordell . he and his daughter jenny  played beautifully by erin flannery  have just recently moved to this small new england town . cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died . we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman  one can only presume it is his wife  is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour . her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed . again  i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway . cassevetes  it has to be mentioned  is strange to say the least . cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental . there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities . it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent  but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug . thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy .  br    br   casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan . he has a deceptive smile and a virile  commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice . but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene . he just has that slimy  disingenuous  phlegmatic  uneasy way about him . he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film . i guess that is a credit to the writers  the director and to cassevetes himself . there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get  go .  br    br   the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry . there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see  something or someone is watching them . when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck  the young woman wanders into the shed  just to play a prank . once she is there  she is attacked . the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail . hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in . he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would  be lover bleeding in the corner  and then smacko  the guy gets it . it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note .  br    br   also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces . tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place  he has another dream . toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother  a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galen .  br    br   throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time  the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped . this is my first feeble  and careful  attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement . it just didn  t strike the right chord .  br    br   the incubus is a well done film . it is tense  tight and even most of the performances are very well done . i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders . but when you get through all that was good in the film  you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth . and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones .  br    br    out of     this could have been a nine . too bad .

1714 ===> shocking  well  made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces .  br    br   small town doctor tries to discover who  or what  is committing a series of violent sexual murders .  br    br   incubus is a tight mystery  with some horrific murder sequences  that builds to an off  beat and eerie climatic twist . the murder scenes are intense and gory  so this isn  t a film for the squeamish  the direction of john hough  along with a bizarre music score  combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film . it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well . nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight .  br    br   the cast isn  t bad either . the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town . also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter  helen hughes as the town historian  and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen .  br    br   all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re  discovered and re  evaluated .  br    br    out of   

=======================================================================================================

1715 ===> what a horrible  horrible film . the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time . not that i saw much . i left the theatre screaming after about   minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves . meryl streep was awful as usual . how many hurt and tortured expressions can  person have  aidan quinn  s talents were  as so often  totally wasted . and who told gloria estefan she could act  trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes .  brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school  . the kids weren  t even cute  just written in to suit the appalling script . aaargh  wes craven really made me cringe for once . real horror this one   

=======================================================================================================

1716 ===> i saw this movie at a  sneak preview  and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much . this picture was the worst . half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film . i couldnt blame them  if this wasn  t a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture . just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear .  

=======================================================================================================

1717 ===> this is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad  unfortunate death at the box office . i saw this film at a local art cinema  in revival form  shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas . it certainly deserves to be approached a second time  or even a third  . sandra b . takes it to the limit by doing spoken word  taking on some well known songs in this piece  her version of hank william  s  i  m so lonesome i could cry  could easily move you to tears  . maybe someday  audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously  but not without some well placed laughs  too  . the film moves at a brisk pace  thanks to some nice editing   so that some viewers will not find it stale  boring . perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline .  

=======================================================================================================

1718 ===> this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time . not only is it revolutionary in its narration  but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of swedish humor and swedish comedians . felix herngren and fredrik lindstrm are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in sweden today  and this film really puts that on display .  br    br    vuxna mnniskor   adult people  is a warm  hearted and hilarious story about adulthood  and the question if we wouldnt be better off without it .  

=======================================================================================================

1719 ===> this kind of  inspirational  saccharine is enough to make you sick . it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth . it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it . the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car i guess you  d need such prompting to feel if you  re stupid enough to watch a film as simple  minded and sappy as this . streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it  s just that    a display  switched on and off like a light . because i can  t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film . even though it  s based on a true story  and an inspirational one at that i  m sure  the set  up  execution and performances play like a third  rate tv movie or half  witted high school drama .

1720 ===>   nacho libre         br    br   directed by jared hess  br    br   starring jack black  ana de la reguera  hctor jimnez   darius rose  br    br   mpaa rating  pg      for some rough action  and crude humor including dialog   br    br   say what you will about it  i know some people who despise it to no end   but i have always thought that  napoleon dynamite  was a funny movie   not the brightest brick on the wall  but a funny movie  nonetheless . jack black is also a very funny man   irritating at times  yes  and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him  but funny . there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree . so  i was very happy to hear that jared hess  the writer and director of  napoleon dynamite   and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage . my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin . unfortunately  my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie . this plot  had it been done as a skit on some such show as  saturday night live  or possibly even  mad tv   would have worked flawlessly . unfortunately  the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one  joke comedy falls flat .  br    br   nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord . feeling shunned by the entire monastery  nacho  black   now the monastery  s cook  decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler . as the monastery  s finances hit an all  time low  nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery  s orphanage . this plot sounds so sweet and caring . it seems like the perfect movie for jack black . look what he did with  school of rock  after all . well  to my displeasure  this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie . it is again hollywood  s way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course  for all i know  maybe that is the general thought of teenagers  as many seemed to enjoy this movie . watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh  but don  t expect to get an award for putting it in your movie . a seven  year  old could make up the same joke .  br    br   the performances in  nacho libre  are actually good . jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic  worthless lines in ever put on paper comical . unfortunately  this movie just wasn  t enough for him . it didn  t give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him . i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before  but now i can say that  not only is she quite talented  but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight . she just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well . hctor jimnez  who plays nacho  s bumbling partner  esqueleto  kept me laughing continuously . he did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of jack black  s . darius rose  who plays an orphan named chancho  didn  t have many lines  but  what can i say  i just enjoyed him . he was adorable . the rest of the cast did their job . it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub  par movie .  br    br    nacho libre  just does not work . its plot is stretched far too thin . the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don  t work . i very rarely laughed and  if i did  it was because of jack black or another member of the cast . and that leads me to the bright side of  nacho libre   yes  the cast . this cast was justwell  for lack of a better word  they were on . they all clicked  had excellent chemistry together  and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script . after jared hess  s  napoleon dynamite  kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie  i was surprised to find myself so often bored with  nacho libre  . something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was . all i know is that  nacho libre  is not a good movie and yet  because of its cast  it is completely worthless . there is a small reason to watch  if only to watch jack black work . but  if you are not a fan of jack black  then avoid this movie like the plague . i like black  but i am done with this movie and with this review .  br    br   final thought yikes  this is jared hess  s surprisingly disappointing follow  up to his hysterical  napoleon dynamite  .  br    br   overall rating      c

1721 ===> high energy raoul walsh classic from      the bowery places saloon owner and operator wallace beery against bitter rival and dandy  george raft  with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry . it  s not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about  but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids . plenty of wisecracks at the beginning  but the characters soften up as the film progresses . apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in beery  s saloon . the various characters  sexy chorus line  lots of drinking  a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so  called pre  code restrictions  and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself . it all creates a very vivid picture of a life that  s long gone . i don  t like to compare eras  but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today . the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see .  

=======================================================================================================

1722 ===> i love this freekin movie  walsh is a true master of the cinematic form  his film have been sometimes in my opinion  overlooked . but this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in .   br    br   all the wonderful characters that existed  the lifestyle  the mode of dress  the way they spoke  ok they might be exaggerated  but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts .  br    br   i just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact .  br    br   can i get it somewhere on dvd  i have only seen it on tv . but for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one .  

=======================================================================================================

1723 ===> we loved school of rock and jack black . we couldn  t wait to go and see this movie . it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out . my husband hated it too . the only funny parts were in the trailers . my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money . the writing was awful . it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended . the movie wasn  t that long but to us it seemed like an eternity . the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry . i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts  but there weren  t . save you money and your time .  

=======================================================================================================

1724 ===> what a disappointment   br    br   this film seemed to be trying to copy  cutting edge  comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy  sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition . jack black  s acting  role was self  indulgent and self  regarding . . . and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting . the soundtrack was tedious . we are  were  fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration . why did he feel he needed to make this mistake   br    br   we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first    br    br   was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel   

=======================================================================================================

1725 ===> four words account for why this film was made   she done him wrong  . the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay    s melodramas were a viable proposition . here we are rewarded with a fast moving  well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars .  br    br   wallace beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals jackie cooper is a little harder to take  but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock  in  trade damsel in distress . with a strong director  as walsh proves himself to be  wray could carry a lot of punch  and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and beery  s affection .  br    br   lots of atmosphere  beautifully designed  this is a forgotten film worthy of revival .  

=======================================================================================================

1726 ===> george raft as steve brodie  the carefree  dancing gambler who can never refuse a dare  is pitted against the lumbering  sentimental  chuck connors  wallace beery  . a soft touch for every panhandler  connors impulsively adopts waifs and strays  notably runaway orphan  swipes   jackie cooper  complete with kittens   and the homeless lucy calhoun  an out  of  town innocent with ambitions to become a writer .  br    br   in this male  dominated culture  communication takes place mostly in the form of violence  one sees why the bowery is a martin scorsese favorite  . exploding cigars provide a running gag .  swipes  enjoys throwing rocks through windows in chinatown  on one occasion setting a laundry alight .  the simultaneous arrival of both brodie  s and beery  s volunteer fire companies leads to a brawl  during which the building burns to the ground .  beery casually saps a troublesome girl  and thumps anyone who disagrees with him  including brodie  whom he defeats  in a night  time fist fight on a moored barge  to regain control of his saloon  lost on a bet that brodie wouldn  t have the courage to jump off the brooklyn bridge .  brodie does make the leap  but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment .   br    br   as usual  walsh fills the frame with detail  illustrating with relish the daily life of the tenderloin singing waiters  bullying barmen  whores from suicide hall being hustled into the black maria  tailors collaring hapless hicks off the street and forcing them to buy suits they don  t want . a minor but admirable little film .  

=======================================================================================================

1727 ===> i  m sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn  t . you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy  slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department .  br    br   i just sat there through most of the movie thinking  is this supposed to be funny  and  this is the guy from tenacious d right   . the truth is this film has nothing to offer . at all  it  s a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction . you  ll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn  t . i was bored stupid about   minutes in but though it would surely pick up . it didn  t .   minutes later i  d barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful .  br    br   it  s like  remember years ago when you  d see anything with your fave actor in it  even some of their really early pap from before they were famous  and you  d be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop . yeah it  s like that .  br    br   i  ve enjoyed some of jack black  s earlier movies like shallow hall and i  m really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man . if you do this to us again jack i  m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something . at the least give you a serious talking to .  br    br   i know it  s a clich but this is one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen and for so many reasons . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

1728 ===> jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing  but in this movie . . .  br    br   besides the direction  writing  lack of plot  constant mugging  aided and abetted by constant straight  on camera shots   and a .    joke batting average  it was still an utter waste of time . the idea sounds promising  but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i  ve seen this side of you  tube .  br    br   i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively . while that  s no doubt true  i really don  t think this movie is meant to be racist . i think that  s it  s more a result of a  creative  team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess . you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera  hey look  it  s an ugly mexican  laugh  people  please  for the love of all things tenacious  laugh    br    br   but put the racism charges aside . when you get down to it  it  s anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended  imo .  

=======================================================================================================

1729 ===> culled from the real life exploits of chuck connors and steve brodie in     s new york   the bowery  is high energy and good natured .  br    br   but be warned casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of wallace beery and little jackie cooper . the very first shot might be startling . this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made . and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods . it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere .  br    br   beery as connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action  a loud  mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade . and he has a soft spot for ornery orphan cooper . raft as brodie is connors  slicker  better looking rival in almost every endeavor . brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention  leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge  it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy  .  br    br   beery is as bombastic as ever with a put  on irish  american accent . he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children  cats and ladies in distress . this is possibly the most boisterous character raft ever played  and he even gets to throw in a little dancing  as well as a show of leg  . and again he mistakes the leading lady  lovely fay wray  for a prostitute . cooper is as tough as either of them  though he gets a chance to turn on the tears .  br    br   the highlight isn  t the jump off the bridge but a no  holds  barred fistfight between connors and brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals . it  s sure someone bruised more than an ego .  

=======================================================================================================

1730 ===> when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud . this is not steven kings best work . i thought that his best work was the shining . i don  t think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking . as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick . i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius . making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool . people who didn  t like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all . don  t expect something from a movie that it isn  t . it still in a general area wasn  t that good . i still recommend people to watch the movie  

=======================================================================================================

1731 ===> are you kidding me   a show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal  how talented do you have to be to do this  she may be able to cook but it is not portrayed in this half  hour stomach churning painful production . i know she has a martha  stewart  esquire empire . so does warren buffett but i don  t see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and alpo .  br    br   she has a nephew named . . . brycer . brycer  stop talking about anyone a name that stupid .  br    br   more time is spent on  table  scapes  than actual cooking . who has that kind of time   silicon should be on your spatula  not on my tv . this show should be on cartoon network  not food network .  

=======================================================================================================

1732 ===> this movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the coppola family . it doesn  t seem to know whether to be an  a  or a  b  western . i mean  the hero is called hopalong cassidy for god  s sake . william boyd must be spinning in his grave .  br    br   all the  b  western cliches are here . the two  gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed   c  mon thunder    the all  in  black bearded villain  the heroine in distress  the rancher in trouble  the cowardly sheriff  over the top bad guys etc .  br    br   the acting  with few exceptions  is strictly from the yakima canutt school of acting . chris lybbert  who   as the hero and louis schweibert  who   as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a    s poverty row quickie . the addition to the cast of veteran performers martin sheen  robert carradine  clu gulager and will hutchins helps a little  but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one .  br    br   what was the point of the martin sheen  robert carradine framing sequences  are we to believe that the sheen character was a ghost  what was the purpose of the black gloves  it just didn  t make sense .  br    br   being a great lover of westerns from all genres  i tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film . the cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic . aside from the hero and main villain  the other characters looked authentic .  br    br   if the producers were going to resurrect the hopalong cassidy character  they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written  a grizzled foul  mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder  the kind of part lee marvin would have excelled in .  br    br   what else can i say but . . on thunder  on big fellow .  

=======================================================================================================

1733 ===> there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else . maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable . but as i keep watching it over and over again  it never gets old  and i never get bored . from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending  there is something insane  sad and scary at the same time  and it keeps ringing in your head sometimes dead is better   br    br   i don  t think it would be useful to relate the whole story again . all you need to know is it starts from point a  the most perfect situation for a happy american family  and step by step drowns to point b  which is  believe me  the very end of all joy  . the music is perfect  the story makes sense  the special effects are cool  and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be . like i said  sometimes dead is better   

=======================================================================================================

1734 ===> overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come . although the plot is not     accurate to the book most everything is correct . the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts . i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie  because i hadn  t found out about the movie yet  but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal  mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected . overall i give this movies a  out of   for its good parts  relative accuracy and overall making sense  and for its bad parts  large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies  .  

=======================================================================================================

1735 ===> very much a film from the times   extremely long sequences with no dialogue  bad flashbacks  and an almost entirely male cast . the two women who appear have a total of under   lines and exist only as romantic interests for men .  br    br   o  toole is riveting whenever he speaks unfortunately  he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery . alastair sims is always a joy to see but he  too  is terribly underused .  br    br   the film has one additional positive aspect  in that it depicts many aspects of british fascism and fascist sympathies  such as the casual appearance of the mosley graffiti  that many people today are unaware of . too many of today  s films about wwii paint the allies as all  good and the axis as all  evil  when history tells us people are far more complicated than that   br    br   this would be a good movie for when you  re recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex . if you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize  this is the movie for you .  

=======================================================================================================

1736 ===>       s undeservedly popular  i love the    s  is an inane  idiotic  offensive and downright disgusting pop  culture mess of a show that was the first in a long  line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh   which was at one time the only real music  oriented channel left on tv  i used to practically live on vh  up until the spring or winter  i forget which one now  of     when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever . out of sheer morbid curiosity  i  d guess that  s what you  d call it  i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look  see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap . at least i can honestly say that i wasn  t a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement  level to begin with . the emphasis of this show i found out within the first  minutes was less on each year of the      s and what was and wasn  t culturally significant or popular  which is what i was expecting to see   but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god  awful no  name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills rolls eyes . . . more like lack  thereof if you ask me  it  s pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so  called  humor  that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one  liner they shot off one after another  altogether  i have no problem in saying that  i love the    s  was  is trash of the lowest denominator  and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh  anymore .  

=======================================================================================================

1737 ===> ah  clichs  clichs  clichs they  re a main part of a wide variety of horror films . this one  has a lot of them . still  it  s stephen king  one of the best masters of horror . this movie was really good  just too predictable . and what horror movie doesn  t have stupid people  this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken . pet semetary i found to be creepy a little . the way everything is set up was really spooky  but not terrifying . for the most part  the acting was somewhat believable  the suspense wasn  t that suspenseful  but the entertainment level is set at a major rank my eyes were practically glued to the screen . all stephen king fans must see this movie  but as for anyone else  expect an okay thriller .  

=======================================================================================================

1738 ===> probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet . not surprising  since king himself wrote the screenplay . the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house . one of the other residents is jud  a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area . one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard . the other is a path leading to the pet sematary  where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway . soon enough  ellie creed  s cat  church  is found dead . luckily  this happens while the family  with the exception of louis  the father   is away for thanksgiving . jud takes louis to another burial ground  beyond the pet sematary  where church is to be buried . later  louis is greeted  not so politely  by church . he  s returned  appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in . maybe he was buried alive . maybe not . nothing more i can say without ruining the story .  br    br   of all the king adaptions i  ve seen this would be the most terrifying . the characters are real and the situations are normal . mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings . suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film  due in part to the plot development . the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever . then  of course  we have the conclusion . easy to determine what  s going to happen  but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary  and sometimes disturbing  moments .  br    br   overall  this is a good film and an excellent adaption . if you enjoy being scared and don  t mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then  pet sematary  is just what you  re looking for . non horror fans will want to avoid this .  

=======================================================================================================

1739 ===> al pacino  kim basinger  tea leoni  ryan o  neal  richard schiff  my mouth was watering . i dropped everything to watch this movie on cable .   minutes in i was having trouble staying awake .   minutes in and i hit the record button and fell asleep . finished watching it the next morning . shouldn  t have bothered . what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a  day in the life . . .  cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie . i guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep . dialogue horrible . continuity non  existent . camera work could have been done with a hand held super  and looked better .  br    br   this movie was a total disaster .  

=======================================================================================================

1740 ===> unless somebody enlightens me  i really have no idea what this movie is about . it looks like a picture with a message but its far from it . this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems . and  thats basically all . when that agent is played by pacino  one must think that it must be something important . but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is . to one of the best actors in the world  al pacino  this is the second movie of the year  the other is  simone   that deserves the title  the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year  . so  whats going on  al   

=======================================================================================================

1741 ===> ok  first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was  years old . if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time  id probably have noted that this is just another cheaply  made  cable  tv horror film with some well  made scenes . but when youre nine you just dont care about those facts . this scared the hell out of me back then  especially those aforementioned zelda  scenes  and they still do  . nowadays im kind of hooked to this film . i have to see this maybe once in a month  and on every new years eve i watch this with a    pack of beer  bunch of friends . its like an appetizer for a good party  i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense . midkiff and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like  but one cant see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two . hughes and gwynne pretty much save the scenes which  the creeds  underact . what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary  and i dont mean the zombie stuff here . the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind . honestly  how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable  tv one  but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror  chillers out there  alright i busted some of the casts balls a minute ago  but i have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection . but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary  i really would love to know . . . and i dont mean night of the living dead here . . . this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff .  

=======================================================================================================

1742 ===> spoilers herein  br    br   what really scares you  killer sharks  or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message  maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath   br    br   maybe . but those fears don  t even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider   and that is the death of one  s own child .  pet sematary  taps this base  primal adult fear  and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore .  br    br   i  ve read comments about this film that include poor acting  characters making stupid decisions  etc . i disagree . the acting is actually first rate for a film like this . maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario . but the film  s events are not only logical  they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible . this is the true horror of  pet sematary   it isn  t that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels  it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does . despite warning  or even past history .  br    br   the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart . the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect . and the results are horrifying . in fact  when the film dives into slasher territory near the end  it  s almost a letdown  although i believe it  s perfectly logical how it got there .  br    br   i am a true horror fan  and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made . if you don  t think so  see it again after you have children .  

=======================================================================================================

1743 ===> in what seemed like the longest  hour   i  ve had to endure in a long time  al pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure . not his usual typecasting  which was nice . but his character was just truely pathetic . someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy . but in this movie we needed someone to like . and for some reason  every character in the picture said  i don  t know why i like you  eli  to al pacino  s chracter and i couldn  t even come close to liking him .  br    br   all the other actors played their usual styles . tea leoni  richard schiff  and bill nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on tv or in earlier films . and kim basinger wasn  t even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind .  br    br   the movie  s story had no momentum . most scenes never driving the story forward  but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti  climactic ending . it had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story .  br    br   whats the point of the film  daniel algrant and jon robin baitz would have you believe  once hollywood has you  you can  t get out .  yeah right  and that  s why so many people get fired in hollywood .

1744 ===> firstly  i must admit that it isn  t a good movie . and  i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn  t in it .  br    br   the movie is about a publicist  s strange   hours . and he is overworked  dizzy  sick and sometimes regretful . i don  t like the character at all . it  s really boring  after   minutes you may fall asleep . and i don  t understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie . just because of money or what   br    br   since i  m an avid pacino fan  i bought this     movie people i know . if you haven  t bought it yet  don  t even think about it  it  s just a waste of time .

1745 ===>   pet sematary  succeeds on two major situations . first  it  s a scary horror movie . those that just aren  t produced in these days . second  it  s an emotional  clever movie overall . so if you are looking for chills  scares  creepiness and visually stunning settings  great acting  dialongs  and gruesome effects this is the movie you are looking for . a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan .  br    br   probably  the best adaptation to any of king  s novels . the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel  but that doesn  t means that this underrated movie isn  t a complete horror  drama accomplishment .  br    br   stephen king  s novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time . the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there  s a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it  s members . then  when everything seems to be happiness  technically happy  because the title  pet sematary  does not offers appiness   a tragic event changes the movie  s atmosphere  now it turns very dark . the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits  but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad  gray  creepy . dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family  s entire life  and  pet sematary  proves it dramatically .  br    br   the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience  but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot . sadly enough  the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead . the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it  s something much  much worse . what will happened with the lives of our all american family  could pascow prevent this tragedy  what is it with the surreal nightmares   br    br   watch  pet sematary  to witness one of the most touching  emotional horror movies of recent times . you won  t regret . the acting is very good although i didn  t dig the actor who portrayed the father . he didn  t seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation . but that  s just my opinion . denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble  tender mother . baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts . shivers . overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people  s deepest fears . . . the loss of someone you love  the dead returning to life  and a feeling of desperation .  br    br   something is for sure . . . i don  t wanna be buried  in a pet sematary

1746 ===> if you ever have the chance to see sandra bernhard live in person  you better move on it sweetie . i saw her last year in los angeles at the opening of her everything bad and beautiful tour and i still can  t believe that i was in the first row  and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show . she is now in new york with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner   without you i  m nothing  . we have lost richard pryor  lenny bruce  nina simone  but sandra is still with us . patti smith is missing in action  but not sandra . barbara streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but sandra more than makes up for where babs leaves off . okay  i want it known  ms . bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more . i really wanted to push this film because of its truth  honesty  humor  eclectic songs  ranging from laura nyro  sylvester  nina simone  prince   and a script that defines the decadence  joy  sadness  ups and downs of the    s and    s . it is my opinion that many  and i mean  many  comics have lifted  okay outright stolen  so much from this show if not from sandra herself . i won  t name names but come on  people  you and i know who they are . see  the thing is  bernhard plays by her own rules . this movie shows  as does her live performances  that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business  as well as pushing forward . her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs  during the time of miles davis  coltrane  monk      s tv shows  intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from judy garland to joan jett . most comedians couldn  t even touch where sandra is coming from or going to . so  here i was  a year ago  watching sandra at the silent movie theater  in total awe and joy . i wanted to meet her after the show  give her something that meant something to me  that  hopefully would mean something to her . but i listen to my copy of giving til it hurts  and just thank her in a prayer  of sorts for making me laugh  making me think  making me feel . you can  t deny this lady  s presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage . she  s still here  damn it  even after the release of without you i  m nothing  some   years ago . and she looks great  by the way . i know this firsthand  walking from the theater one audience member said to another   she is so funny . . and she still looks incredible    if you can  t experience her live yet  please see this movie . as for me  i do hope that sandra will see this . you  ve meant a heck of a lot to me  gotten me through some tough crazy times . if you can send me an email  please do . if not  knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so  is enough for me . come on  people  give it up for the lady      

=======================================================================================================

1747 ===> i don  t know what this movie is about  really . it  s like a student  s art school project . they never say why the world is dark  but it is always darkness except for seconds a day . there are long  interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason . what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images . a black woman enters the main character  s apartment . somehow she becomes pregnant overnight  then gets shot in the head . the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges . i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be . honestly  i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it  s about . but i wouldn  t wish this level of hell on anybody else .  

=======================================================================================================

1748 ===> the only good thing about  people i know  is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that al pacino should avoid performing in . the first big turn  off i had was the way in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone . dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot . the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting  and within an hour i still saw no signs of a sturdy plot . the story overall is a real bore  and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake .  br    br   this movie will surely bore you as well . . . avoid at all costs .

1749 ===> this is one of the creepiest  scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie ever   br    br   dr creed  louise  and his family moving in to new home with his wife  rachel   daughter  ellie  and little son  gage  everything seems normal until dr creed loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury  then he is haunted by the ghost know as victor takes him to the pet sematarty and show him that where the dead come to life .  br    br   louis not knowing if that was all dream and is talking to ellie who worried about her cat that could be killed by lorry and then later on rachel tells louis that it really hard for to talk about death because of her sister zelda who was really sick  as we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever    br    br   the next day louis gets a call from jed saying there cat as been killed by lorry and jed take him to place where victor the ghost told him not to go  and bury the cat  his wife and kids have go to see their grandparents and louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it as evil in it eyes so he goes to see jed then jed tell him that he also buried his dog there too  as we seen other flashback  .  br    br   later on in the movie the family out having picnic  gage is playing with kite and gage say  s i drop it   the wind blow the rod near the road where a lorry coming at fast past  gage is get closer to road  louis is rushing to get him  the most heartbreaking scene in any horror movie will leave with your jaw on floor or shivers will go down your back when you hear louis screams  soon he missing him so much  louis then buries gage in same place where is buried the cat .  br    br   the scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from really life .  br    br   this movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great    out    

=======================================================================================================

1750 ===> i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king  s books  this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable .  br    br   i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart  wrenching as well as scary .  br    br   the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out . and the  no fair  uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

1751 ===> very silly movie  filled with stupid one liners and jewish references thru out . it was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously . a familiar movie plot . . . being at the wrong place at the wrong time . an atrocious subplot  involving kim bassinger . very robotic and too regimented . i have noticed that al pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill . a troubleshooter with troubles  but nothing more troubling than pacinos horrible atlanta accent . damage control needs to fix this damage of a film . ok my one liners are bad  but not as bad as the ones in this film . this movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well . usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons . this movie is unwatchable . i did manage to sit through this . the plot  if written a tad bit better  with  perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot  and even dumber jokes  could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums . what we are left with is a dull  silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that eli wurman was jewish . an embarrassment to all the good jewish folk everywhere .  

=======================================================================================================

1752 ===>   people i know  is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about   despite the game efforts of a talented cast .  br    br   pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman  a past  his  prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption . but unlike michael corleone  it  s impossible to have an emotional investment in this character  his dilemma  or his fate .  br    br   the film traces eli  s preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause  while distracted by a client  s  ryan o  neal  good in an underwritten part  latest  dirty laundry    in this case  a tv actress companion who  s gotten involved with the wrong people . tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role  although again  the script doesn  t give her much to work with . as eli  s sister  in  law  kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics .  br    br   this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff  and enjoy the other principals . unfortunately  between the script and direction   people i know  is strictly amateurish . hence its limited theatrical release  and speedy journey to dvd . consider yourself warned .

1753 ===> louis creed  a doctor from chicago  moves to a large house near a small town  since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine  s . along with him  is his wife rachel and their two kids  ellie and gage  as well as ellie  s cat  church . soon  they met their new neighbor  and old man named judd crandall . judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house  that is constantly a way used by big trucks  but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house . judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery  but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children  since she has traumas from her sister zelda  s death .  br    br   during the first week of the family in the new house  louis already has dead people to deal with victor pascow  a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident  addresses his dying words to louis personally  even though the two men are strangers . on the night following pascow  s death  louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow  who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not  go beyond  no matter how much you feel you need to .  louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream  until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles . anyway  he dismisses the dream . many strange things starts to happen and church  ellie  s cat  dies while walking on the highway . louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church  s death with ellie  but judd  sympathizing with him  jud takes louis to the pet cemetery  supposedly to bury church . but instead of stopping there  jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to  the real cemetery   an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac   . . . indians . . .   . there louis buries the cat on jud  s instruction  with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life . and that is where the real horror story begins . . .  br    br   i personally find this movie very good . it  s not the most horrifying of all  but it is one of the best horror movies i watched . the way gage dies  is almost impossible to not stay in your memory  specially being a toddler . it  s cool to see stephen king  s cameo as the minister of the funeral .  br    br   of course  there are some script errors how can a rich doctor with two small kids  goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house  how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck  why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters  things like that doesn  t make any sense  but i can understand that all horror  s scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work .  br    br   a good thing i saw in this movie  is the necessity to talk about death with the children  no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist  and also that avoiding important subjects doesn  t help anything . because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie  confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn  t be back again  all the nightmare began .

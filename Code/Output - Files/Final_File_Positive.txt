0 ===> bromwell high is a cartoon comedy . it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life  such as  teachers  . my   years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high  s satire is much closer to reality than is  teachers  . the scramble to survive financially  the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers  pomp  the pettiness of the whole situation  all remind me of the schools i knew and their students . when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school  i immediately recalled . . . . . . . . . at . . . . . . . . . . high . a classic line inspector i  m here to sack one of your teachers . student welcome to bromwell high . i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched . what a pity that it isn  t

1 ===> airport    starts as a brand new luxury    plane is loaded up with valuable paintings  such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens  james stewart  who is flying them  a bunch of vip  s to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum  also on board is stevens daughter julie  kathleen quinlan   her son . the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid  air the plane is hi  jacked by the co  pilot chambers  robert foxworth   his two accomplice  s banker  monte markham   wilson  michael pataki  who knock the passengers  crew out with sleeping gas  they plan to steal the valuable cargo  land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean  loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle . with air in short supply  water leaking in  having flown over    miles off course the problems mount for the survivor  s as they await help with time fast running out . . .  br    br   also known under the slightly different tile airport     this second sequel to the smash  hit disaster thriller airport       was directed by jerry jameson  while once again like it  s predecessors i can  t say airport    is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best  just . it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid  air hi  jacking  then the crashing  didn  t he see the oil rig    sinking of the     maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure         submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside  either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the    floods or if any of the doors are opened  it  s a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character  s  dull dialogue  lethargic set  pieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for    odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  there  s not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . even when the navy become involved things don  t pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but there  s just something lacking here . george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background .  br    br   the home video  theatrical version of airport    run    minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence  many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni  flashbacks to flesh out character  s  longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport    . as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices  i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren  t great either . along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award  s hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that  s a little harsh . the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately  the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly .  br    br   the production values are alright if nothing spectacular . the acting isn  t great  two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this  one time oscar winner james stewart looks old  frail  also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too .  br    br   airport    is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far  i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly  the production  bland direction doesn  t help though  a film about a sunken plane just shouldn  t be this boring or lethargic . followed by the concorde . . . airport          .

2 ===> this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon . sure  its flawed . it does not give a realistic view of homelessness  unlike  say  how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers  or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots  . many of the jokes fall flat . but still  this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not  and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive . its not the fisher king  but its not crap  either . my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead  i love mel as a director and writer  not so much as a lead  .

3 ===> when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors . it was one of many movies i watched with my parents  but this was the only one we walked out of . since then i had never seen interiors until just recently  and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it . what a pretentious  ponderous  and painfully boring piece of    s wine and cheese tripe . woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career . in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman  allen gives us a dark  angular  muted  insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce  estrangement  career  love  non  love  halitosis  whatever . the film  intentionally  has no comic relief  no music  and is drenched in shadowy pathos . this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature  using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a  more pronounced depth of meaning and truth  . but woody allen is no ingmar bergman . the film is painfully slow and dull . but beyond that  i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters . instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling  whining  nicotine stained  martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity . amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room . everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes . everyone is  lost  and  struggling   desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them . it  s never about resolution  it  s only about interminable introspective babble . it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience  s ability to connect . woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out . and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining . i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance . i highly recommend this one if you  re feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death . otherwise  let  s just pretend this film never happened .

4 ===> yes its an art . . . to successfully make a slow paced thriller .  br    br   the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don  t even notice it happening .  br    br   fine performance by robin williams . the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film . however  the core plot is very engaging . the movie doesn  t rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering . the direction is good . use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good .  br    br   very nice  time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story   

=======================================================================================================

5 ===> i don  t know who to blame  the timid writers or the clueless director . it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars  angie  charlie  denise  rosanna and jon  that there wasn  t enough left to really make a movie . this could have been very entertaining  but there was a veil of timidity  even cowardice  that hung over each scene . since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a    year  old woman and not angie harmon  why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world  if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead  this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn  t a five year old . what a waste  not just for the viewers but for the actors as well .  

=======================================================================================================

6 ===> you know  robin williams  god bless him  is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade  with perhaps the exception of  death to smoochy   which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic  . the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic  especially  insomnia  and  one hour photo  .  the night listener   despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release  is among his best work  period .  br    br   this is a very chilling story  even though it doesn  t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . in high school  i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson  who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result . i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist . when i saw this movie  the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind .  br    br   toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic  caretaker  . her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like  little miss sunshine  . there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me . it takes a good actress to play that sort of role  and it  s this understated  yet well reviewed  role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award  as of      . it  s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this  and it  s scary too .  br    br   this is a good  dark film that i highly recommend . be prepared to be unsettled  though  because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end .  

=======================================================================================================

7 ===> this film is one giant pant load . paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay . and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process .  br    br   the worst though is woody harrelson  whom i ordinarily like when he  s properly cast . he plays  the walker   a homosexual man in d . c . who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite . he couldn  t have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick . his  southern accent  is that  off the rack  version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers  as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has . it is monotonous . but  his is not the worst accent in the movie . his  boyfriend   played by moritz bleibtreau  attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him . he is incapable of rolling his r  s in spite of the fact that in real life he is german  and speaks several languages  one of them being italian  that  s kind of a good reason to cast someone else don  t ya think   br    br   from the story  to the screenplay  to the directing  to the camera work  to the performances by the leads  this movie is bad from beginning to end . the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily tomlin  lauren bacall  and kristin scott thomas . only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact . in fact  all three are excellent  in spite of being trapped in a really bad film . ufortunately  no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws . if you like these three actresses  watch them in something else . this movie is not worth your time .

8 ===> there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times . constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis  have kept psychologists  counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades . occasionally  some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence . that is the premise of the film entitled  the night listner .  it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon  robin williams  who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles . perhaps its because his show is losing it  s authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself . feeling abandoned by both his lover jess  bobby cannavale  and his and best friend  joe morton   he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation . it is here  a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help . noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a   year old boy called peter  rory culkin  . in reading the boy  s harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents  noon is captivated and wants to help . however  things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en  wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare . this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d . logand  sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop  this might be comical . instead  this may prove to be one of william  s more serious performances .   

=======================================================================================================

9 ===> this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men  s wives .  br    br   i thought  the walker  would be thrilling and engaging  but i was so wrong . the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow  that even after   minutes of the film nothing happens much . seriously  the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes . that  s how slow it is .  br    br   the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom . it  s almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion . maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class   br    br   it  s sad that  the walker  becomes such a boring mess  despite such a strong cast . blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing .  

=======================================================================================================

10 ===> like one of the previous commenters said  this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery . such a waste because collette  s performance was eerie and williams was believable . i just kept waiting for it to get better . i don  t think it was bad editing or needed another director  it could have just been the film . it came across as a canadian movie  something like the first few seasons of x  files . not cheap  just hokey . also  it needed a little more suspense . something that makes you jump off your seat . the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax . i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the  reality  of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy . this movie needs to have a director  s cut that tries to fix these problems .  

=======================================================================================================

11 ===> i saw this movie at a drive  in in     . until  howard the duck  i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen . this movie tried to combine all the genera in one comedy  horror  teenage angst  and the hot rod that must have sired  my mother  the car .  maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it  s time .  

=======================================================================================================

12 ===> if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing . the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery  and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about . however  there is not much tension  and williams  mild mannered portrayal doesn  t do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy .  br    br   collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear . the production felt rushed and holes are apparent . it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort . the book is probably better .  br    br   one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort .

13 ===>   ghost of dragstrip hollow  appears to take place in a spotless netherworld  an era long gone by  where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket . it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival  who pressures her into a car race . that  s about it for the drag  racing   this b  flick is mostly concerned with rock  n roll  man  the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent  square teens who liked to party and yet didn  t mind an adult chaperone . there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges  necking kid  we thought we  d come out for some fresh air  . . . dad  where did you think you  d find it  down her throat     but the ghost is a little late in arriving . brief at   minutes  the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off  screen and a pre   scooby doo   styled unmasking which makes no sense . however  for nostalgia buffs  some mindless fun .  from

14 ===> when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky  and i  ll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong . while every movie has its flaws  the night listener had an exceptionally low count .  br    br   if you read the last review  it was hard  since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie   you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done . unfortunately  if you read more than  lines into that same review  you discovered the poster  s reason for disdain he  she does not like the fact that the director is gay  or that the production team smokes crack . . . apparently  .  br    br   so  despite the fact that i have never written a review before  i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits  not the sexual orientation of its director . let  s go over a quick checklist first  . great plot  absolutely . i won  t give a shred of it away  but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials . this is a thriller  not a horror  and it should be approached as such . the story really will amaze you  even more so because it  s true  and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events  .  br    br    . wonderful acting  oh yes . robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type  cast  and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago . he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener  playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of . . . well  i  ll let you see for yourself .  br    br    . excellent direction  certainly . now  unlike the other poster to which i referred  i actually know something about direction . i  ve been sutdying the art of direction at school now for  years . of course i really don  t think that makes a lick of difference  the only thing that matters is if you like the direction   but i thought i should simply establish once again that i  m basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant . . . for example not the sexual orientation of the director  or the alleged drug habits of the production team  lol  .  br    br   patrick stettner  s direction was moody and dark  and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so  sought  after feelings of  tension and release  rather than the messy  fast  paced camera  work and quick cuts we  re so often subjected to today . some people can truly show you a story through their camera  while other  s feel as if they have to make the story with the camera . i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized  which is as an eyeball through which we all see .  br    br    . lighting  cinematography  and editing  great all around . i  ve already wrote so much  and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs  so i  ll just wrap it up .  br    br   in short  go see this movie . don  t listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it  especially if they  re so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive    of the way through their post . enjoy the show   ben

15 ===> i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments . it  s not a bad movie exactly  but it  s one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre . plus  it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways  and the characters  behavior often strains belief . i  d say its a film that you would get something out of if you don  t have a lot of film  tv  literature  life behind you  to be honest  i  ve seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even  . otherwise  its point has been made before and more artfully . and that gets to the big problem  which is that it really doesn  t have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point . it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling  and it doesn  t really pay off .  

=======================================================================================================

16 ===> this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces   the fall of the house of usher    dance of death   poem   is actually quite creepy from beginning to end . it is similar to some of the old black  and  white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house  for example   the cat and the canary    the old dark house    night of terror  and so on  . boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life  size dolls that terrorize the guests . he dies early in the film  or does he   and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences . i won  t go into too much detail here  but it is definitely a must  see for fans of old dark house mysteries .  br    br   watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room .  br    br   dan basinger

17 ===> summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what  s the hottest movie of the week  given   .   of the screens dedicated to screening it . ok  so i may exaggerate on the percentage  but you get my drift . besides stuff from hollywood  bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters  and from some of the trailers shown  i  m hyped to watch them too . tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for      but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas . when i watched jodha akbar  it was a full house  but it wasn  t for tashan .  br    br   after watching it  i knew why . it was entertaining  but it was fundamentally weak . just like it  s literal english title  which means  style   tashan is all style  but little substance . not that it doesn  t have the usual star power  but scenes felt forced  and some bordered on a tad ridiculous  even for bollywood standards i must say . which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya  who wrote dhoom and dhoom   both of which i enjoyed tremendously .  br    br   in his rookie directorial outing with tashan  while you can  t fault his direction  you  d probably scratch your head over the plot  which was clunky at best . it tried to force too many things into the story  though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation  but that came a little too late  and only toward the finale  which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie  with hong kong  s wirework and hollywood  s ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil . and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink  you have an assortment of vehicles appearing  and the one that took the cake  in a dhoom  homage  was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere .  br    br   at best  tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy  and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters . saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff  a call center executive who gives english tuition  only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material . his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh  kareena kapoor   who  s not exactly who she seems  the meek and sweet natured hottie . she engages jimmy  s services for her boss  mobster bhaiyyaji  anil kapoor   who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah  beng does it . and to complete the quartet  akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey  an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji  s business .  br    br   so begins a road trip of sorts  with friends who turned enemies  and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on . jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all  because he goes from zero to hero  executing moves that would shame rambo  in absolutely no time  which is quite out of character . kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men  and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes  and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee . every character has a backstory created  and i thought akshay kumar  s bachchan pandey was probably the best  the most touching and the most fun of the lot  even though his character seemed a lot like a non  green incredible hulk with his gravity  defying leaps and power packing punches . his wounds also heal automatically  which impressively puts wolverine to shame . and the best part is his theme song  which is damn alpha  male and played in ra  ra mode each time he takes on adversaries .  br    br   but sad to say  that  s the only tune that is memorable  something that cheers  bachchan  pandey  bachchan  pandey  . for most bollywood movies i watch  i will usually be able to  despite the obvious language gaps  emerge from screenings humming a tune or two . i wasn  t able to do that after tashan  because the songs unfortunately just weren  t catchy at all . usually the song  dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location . that i enjoy  versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain  or atop jagged rocks on the beach front .  br    br   tashan probably didn  t take itself too seriously  but coming from vijay krishna acharya  s story  you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous  and for continuity to be a little more careful as well . billed as a blockbuster  now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one . despite akshay kumr stealing the show  tashan could have been better on the whole .

18 ===> there  s so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin . en la mente del asesino  inside the killer  s mind   that it  s very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning . let  s just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really  really great done . its made with super   black and white shots    milimeters  color  interviews  flashbacks . aro tolbukhin its like a movie made a documental or viceversa  which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering  did he really ever existed  the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala  worked in a religious mission and then killed some people . an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced . the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death . nowadays  some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character . the one we are witness of  the movie .  br    br   for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aros mind  mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done . nevertheless  the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions  we clearly never justify them . so  the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aro  s childhood  giving the movie such an incredible new force  even tough never got weak or boring  .  br    br   i don  t mean  and don  t want  to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you  believe me  the trip to see it is more than worthy .

19 ===> if this is a     product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry  yash raj  then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards .  br    br   if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil  akshay  saif and kareena  then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film . the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar . he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations .  br    br   the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film . that itself was a clear indicator of the director  s vision . every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted . anil kapoor  s gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times . and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie .  br    br   in short it  s the biggest waste of resourses after  jhoom barabar jhoom  . i would say that even  aaja nachle  was a better enjoyable movie than this .  br    br   one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved . the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay  s love story . after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music . vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song . the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically . only one song  falak tak chal  is somehow good of all in the lot . an opportunity wasted by vishal shekhar .  br    br   regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this  akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location  probably ladakh  . in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car . i am still thinking who wrote this .  br    br   if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts . you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god . are we still seeing a     movie with all these technical heights achieved  so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan .  br    br   dear anil kapoor  akshay kumar  if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out . as artists of such stature  you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers . people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively . i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie  the actors and the production house both .

20 ===> sure  titanic was a good movie  the first time you see it  but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change . the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love  story and think ooh  how romantic . the second time  and i am not the only one to think this  it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking  when is this dn ship going to sink    and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times . the acting in this film is not bad  but definetly not great either . was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film  i mean who does he think he is  anthony hopkins or denzel washington  he does  half  good movie and won  t do a film for less than    million . and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it . but enough about  in my eyes  the worst character of the film . kate winslet  s performance on the other hand was wonderful . i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together . there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love  stories as it is  filmmakers shouldn  t try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie    out of a possible     i give this film a mere    .

21 ===> i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film .  br    br   jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss  lakhan singh  english . the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can  t do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh  who is also known as bhaiyyaji . but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji  lakhan singh is a don . in the meantime  bhaiyyaji hires a man  bachchan pandey  to track down jimmy and pooja .  br    br   starring saif ali khan  kareena kapoor  anil kapoor and akshaye kumar  the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra .  br    br    tashan  has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched . yes  the scenery is good and kareena kapoor  and her much publicised weight loss  looks good . but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other  hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production . with reference to songs  unfortunately  there is not one song that i can remember now .  br    br   there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well . but this cannot be said for anil kapoor  it did not suit him at all as a villain . lastly  never mind aditya chopra  who in the past has produced and directed good films such as  mohabbatein   what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie   br    br   conclusion bad movie  not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression .  

=======================================================================================================

22 ===> just two comments . . . . seven years apart  hardly evidence of the film  s relentless pulling  power  as has been mentioned  the low  budget telemovie status of   gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal . having said that however the thing is not without merit  either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se .  br    br   true  the plot at its most basic is a re  working of the amityville horror  only without much horror . more a case of intrigue  gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax  investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the  house  as the main suspect . the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard . it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments .  br    br   having picked the dvd up for a mere   .   last week at my regular video store  i cannot begrudge the expenditure .    .   would be an acceptable price for the film . just don  t expect fireworks

23 ===> tashan  the title itself explains the nature of the movie .  br    br   this type of movies are actually made for flop . what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c  grade movies . or even some c  grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan . the much hyped and over  confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box  office which it certainly deserved .  br    br   in my view  this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films  banner . how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick  he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi  s ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last . the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences .  br    br   the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences  hearts . in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions . i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay  but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif   s hand instead of akshay . just from the starting point i expected of it  but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth . saif is the main behind the whole adventure  while akshay joins in the midst . in any movie  the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit . and tashan loses in this way  and unexpectedly failed to become a hit .  br    br   akshay  s has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies . he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again . in between saif did a great job in race  and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie . but he has fully developed himself in the acting field . and last but not the least about kareena . she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean . but i myself don  t think so  instead she became slim . yes slim    it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people  or say  male  . beside them it is nice that saif  s son ibrahim appears in the beginning  last as young saif . i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career .  br    br   those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood  or say want to be admitted in an asylum . thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films . in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of  years before going into practical directions .  br    br   sorry  i don  t like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies .  

=======================================================================================================

24 ===> i loved this movie since i was  and i saw it on the opening day . it was so touching and beautiful . i strongly recommend seeing for all . it  s a movie to watch with your family by far .  br    br   my mpaa rating pg    for thematic elements  prolonged scenes of disastor  nudity  sexuality and some language .  

=======================================================================================================

25 ===> i was very displeased with this move . everything was terrible from the start . the comedy was unhumorous  the action overdone  the songs unmelodious . even the storyline was weightless . from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom  i had high expectations . the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all . of course  kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds . i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done . they tend to exaggerate way too much . in chinese films  this style works because that is their signature piece . but  hindi cinema  s signature are the songs . a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic . but  in the future  i  m sure these action movies will get much sharper . also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly . good luck next time .  

=======================================================================================================

26 ===> i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies . anyway  everyone remembers the rms titanic . it was big  fast  and  unsinkable  . . . until april     . it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever . well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship . well  onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film .  br    br   so our two main characters are jack  leonardo dicaprio  and rose  kate winslet  . they  re not annoying too much but watch this and you  ll find out why they could become annoying  http   tinyurl . com  ojhoyn  . the main villain i guess is bad luck  fate  hand of god  no blasphemy intended   or just plain caledon hockley  billy zane  . combine all of the above and what do you get   oh yes  we get a love story on a sinking boat . the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite  mr . andrews  victor garber   idk he was so nice   lovejoy  david warner   murdoch  ewan stewart   lightoller  jonathan phillips   captain smith  bernard hill   molly brown  kathy bates   and many more . we also got the present day treasure hunter  brock lovett  bill paxton  . they add something to the story  something good . the action in here is awesome  especially in the second half  the drama as also good . in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears . the story is simple and it works . a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond . she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic . two lovers separated by social class and ultimately  the fate of the ship . everything about the story works and there are very few flaws . i give titanic  an    awesome  

=======================================================================================================

27 ===> sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie . . . i had had a trauma after watching welcome       and thought that they wont do it again . but after loads of amazing promos  tashan finally ended as heart attack .  br    br   such amazing  songs in promo  dil haara  chhaliya and tashan mein . . . . . and what u get in the movie  zero story  predictable plot  plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss . . .     br    br   music  wise another major disaster . . . in the music album  they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these  jokers and they haven  t thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts . . .  that song is such nice  quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album       if you plan to watch this movie  i would say  watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like . . .  bachchan bachchan pandey . . .   br    br   overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english   br    br   go away man  i need to puke   

=======================================================================================================

28 ===> titanic has to be one of my all  time favorite movies . it has its problems  what movies don  t  but still  it  s enjoyable .  br    br   when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic  i suppose my first reaction is  wait a minute  you don  t   i know so many people who don  t like this movie  and i  m not saying i don  t see why .  the love story is too cheesy  well  yes but isn  t it enjoyable and moving  all right  the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic  everyone knows that love like this doesn  t actually exist . but this is a movie  doesn  t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while  the next complaint  dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors . well  ok  in this movie  i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials . however i think it  s unfair to say that they are terrible actors . i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in . but the roles they are given are simple  and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit  but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected .  br    br   and finally  if one is going to complain that they don  t like this movie because they hate romance  or because they hate history  or tragic movies  then i  m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things . it  s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies . simply for being a movie  not because you dislike the genre  this is a good movie .  br    br   well deserving of its oscars  in particular  best cinematography  which i find to be the best i  ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy .  br    br   i know some of the writing fails  such as the constant screaming of each other  s names throughout the movie . the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times  but overall it  s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real  and the sinking feel so epic .  br    br   i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie  but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea  such as it being a love story  rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed .  br    br   i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic  including memoirs form the day it happened  and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults . the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper  not steel  and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it .  br    br   i give this movie       not because i like romance movies  but simply because it  s an outstanding cinematic achievement  that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events .  

=======================================================================================================

29 ===> this movie is horrible . the acting is a waste basket . no crying  no action  hopeless songs . though the scenery is great . i have always wanted to go to greece .  br    br   anyway  as for saif  you  d expect a great performance  but even he let down the people .  br    br   akshay kumar  recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs . he was sensational in this movie . for only this performance  filmfare should introduce another award . the toiletries award for the worst performance . by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat .  br    br   kareena kapoor . she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma . in acting  in looks  or in body . she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her . she comes into this movie wearing bikini  s and tank tops and short shorts . i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife  to  be dress like that . but  she must  ve impressed some people dressing like that . and if you ask how  then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie . they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom . including me . personally i think that she dressed like a whore  but i really liked it .  br    br   i am forced to give it a      but i  d really give this movie a     . an unachieved film .  

=======================================================================================================

30 ===> for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time . no exceptions . james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller . through films such as aliens  the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science  fiction goes . he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film . but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance . the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises  plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows . the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful  interesting and entertaining film about it . the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren  t given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose  gloria stuart  tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose  s and jack  s story alone  no one else . emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home . the music has become iconic and legendary . it is composer james horner  s finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience . the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is . only one problem  the usual james cameron problem  is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside . james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime . my heart won  t go on from this one .  

=======================================================================================================

31 ===> the sight of kareena kapoor in a two  piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega  disappointing  mind  numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend . bad films are bad films and we see some every week  but tashan is not just a bad film  it  s a terrible film . terrible because it takes its audience for granted  terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they  ve got big movie stars onboard . written and directed by vijay krishna acharya  tashan is what you  d describe as a road movie  but one that  s going in all the wrong directions . saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff  a call  centre executive who  s hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji  that  s anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster  desperate to go cool . jimmy  s got his eye on pooja  the gangster  s pretty young assistant  played by kareena kapoor   who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of   crore rupees . determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja  bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job . so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey  the gangster  s faithful aide from kanpur  who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that  s hidden across the length and breadth of the country . much like those bad eighties potboilers  tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot . but the treatment  s so over  the  top  so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect . instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three  act structure  you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed . that garish item song in the desert  the bullet  dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort  kareeena  s bikini moment  even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks  a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala  and believe it or not  even a dhanno  style horse  driven tonga . in all fairness  not all these set pieces are badly done  the item song in the desert is quite neat actually  but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture  because you  re just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really . little do you expect in a seemingly fast  paced road movie  to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts . you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making . what  s more  i don  t think they cared either  the film reeks of arrogance . arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work  tashan is like an overcooked stew . there are films that kill you softly  and then there  s tashan  a film that kills you with excess . packaged snazzily with glossy  finish camera  work  exotic locations and fancy costumes  every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together  but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn  t hold . borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn  t help either because they don  t blend with the film  s wafer  thin plot . one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging  but anil kapoor  s grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists  and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly  unable to find his feet . kareena kapoor  meanwhile  queen of over  the  top delivery  does a decent job . but of course  if tashan is salvaged to some extent  it  s thanks to akshay kumar  s irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character . you cringe when he  s cupping his crotch repeatedly  and you scowl when he delivers those double  meaning dialogues  but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he  s up there . despite some good music from vishal  shekhar  the songs seem like they  re only prolonging your misery . well that  s because tashan is a test of your patience . in case you didn  t know  tashan means style . i  m sorry to say  this film has none .  

=======================================================================================================

32 ===> this movie re  wrote film history in every way . no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie  because it transcends criticism . every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it . it is an extremely beautiful movie  and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again . i  ve seen it more times than i care to count  and i still become transfixed every time  with a feeling which is hard to describe . one for the ages .  

=======================================================================================================

33 ===> this is the biggest flop of     . i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster . the songs have been added without situations  the story have been stretched to fill the  hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it  s like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with    people . only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish . . . akki is also done a good job . . . . but the movieee just forget it .  

=======================================================================================================

34 ===> i avoided watching this film for the longest time . long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over  hyped  over  blown  overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz  and i wanted nothing to do with it . i never watched it in the theatre . i shook my head in disbelief at the   academy awards  even though i had never seen it . then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest . one of the girls spoke about this movie .  it was so great   she said .  you really felt like you were on the ship .   nonsense   i thought . i shared my feelings with my fellow judges . one looked at me and said   you might be right  but if she liked the movie that much maybe she  ll want to learn more about the real titanic . the movie must have done something right to get her so interested .   well  maybe   thought i . then it finally appeared on pay tv .  ok   i thought   i  ll give it a look see .  i didn  t want to like it  and i didn  t . i loved it  what a great movie .  br    br   where to start  first  the directing . my high school public speaking contestant was right . james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost  you are there  type of atmosphere . the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world . the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic . you don  t just watch it you really do feel it . then  the performances . the lead performances from kate winslet  as rose  and leonardo dicaprio  as jack  are excellent  winslet  s being the superior  i thought  but both were good . they had their rich girl  poor boy characters down to a perfect  t  i thought . in my opinion  though  stealing the show was frances fisher as rose  s mother . she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat  and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack . then  the details . i  m no expert on the sinking of the titanic  but i have a reasonable general knowledge  and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance . very impressive  indeed . then  the song . who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion  s performance of  my heart goes on .   br    br   problems . well  the romance was perhaps too contrived  in the sense that i just don  t accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class .  i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he  s been there for a while .  the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed  i thought  when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats .  br    br   a minor quibble  though . this is truly an excellent movie . my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre  where i think it would have been so much more impressive .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

35 ===> i  ve now written reviews for several of the moh episodes  and this is among the worst . an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll . if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you   let  s check out the basement     then this is your show . except  it  s not amusing or entertaining  it  s just annoying .  br    br   the extent of the virus is never  ever showed . i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only  as the resulting situation is very  very frightening . but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home  and ultimately dies at his hands . the woman flees north  and runs into a few tens situations . then  some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her  things that make you go huh   . or something . then  she is huddling for warmth . the end .  br    br   awful . these directors are mailing this tripe in .

36 ===> i am not a parent  neither am i a male . but i was able to identify with every character  s heartaches and pains .  br    br   this is a movie teenagers should watch . maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again . i  m sorry for those that don  t understand the value of love  family and friendship .  br    br   it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing . and it is great to see a   year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance . he showed at an early age  that he is capable of heartfelt drama . he should be offered more serious roles . note hollywoodland . . . his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in     .  br    br   this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages . maybe shouldn  t be watched by children under   because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families  but i recommend it to the entire family .  br    br   i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times . because it portrays the values that are important in life .

38 ===> family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about . love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about . one man  daddy  has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity . the kids grow up  one all be it  in the hard way  to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is  the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall . all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances . yes  i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent . this true to life is one which every young adult  and parent  would do well to see  although some will not realize it until they too are parents . a must see for those who care about their families .

39 ===> warner bros . made many potboilers in the     s and most of them are fast paced  economical and very entertaining . i really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life . this is one of warner  s few hard  edged melodramas that simply doesn  t work . edward g . robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the    year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences . robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don  t cut the mustard . h . b . warner  aline macmahon and boris karloff are good  but the bad acting of frances starr and anthony bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie . starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie . in addition  the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre  code hollywood . leroy  s direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations . sol polito  s camera work is strong . somehow  this piece of dreck got an oscar nomination for best picture  in a year that gave us  m    dracula  and  frankenstein   .

40 ===> this is a film . .  not porn .  br    br   this is a wonderful film    full of tender moments and memories   a beautiful piece of work    excellent    for intelligent  viewers only     br    br   if you are a film lover . a romantic . a person who has loved deeply  this is your film      br    br   it has a beautiful surreal quality . fine acting and directing . watching this film made me remember my first love .  br    br   thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life  love and the meaning of loss .  br    br   highly recommended for all film lovers .  

=======================================================================================================

41 ===> i grew up on the  superman ii  theatrical version   s  t   and as a kid  i loved it more than part i since not only did it contain more superman and three superman  type villains  it started off with a bang  the best clark kent to superman transformations and rescue scenes . kids no longer had to impatiently wait for superman to appear on screen  as in part i . now as an adult  i can see how the mighty had fallen with s  t  see my review .  i  ve always heard of the back  story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original  s director  richard donner from part ii .  it must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously  now it  s common  back to the future  and  matrix     for example .  unfortunately  after finally seeing the richard donner cut  or   s  rd   i still can  t fully recommend it . gone  was the great superman change scene  the entire paris rescue  as was the wonderful recap of part i in s  t  s opening . in fact  they all but wrote the words  previously on superman  in s  rd . the special effects weren  t great in either part i or s  t  but s  rd  they were mostly downright laughable  such as lois falling from the daily planet window . i will admit  some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures  such as any scene in the  honeymoon suite .  overall  if you grew up on s  t as i did  and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as i do as an adult  you should absolutely see s  rd as it  s almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes .  spoiler alert  unfortunately  the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from s  t replaced with the exact same ending as  i .  this is not only a lazy  unoriginal copout  it doesn  t make sense on why clark would go back to that diner  if those events never actually happened . and will he continue to  turn back time  for every confrontation

42 ===> i was going to bed with my gf last night  and while she was brushing her teeth  i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks . at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie  so i started watching it  and then it immediately captured me in  and i had to finish it .  br    br   the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble . she was such a great actor for being so little . maybe the fact it was in chinese  so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell . . . but she really seemed to be in character perfectly . i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her  boss  but everything just turned out rotten . lol . even when she brings him another grandson  just so he can pass on his art . . . it turns out that kid was kidnapped  so he gets arrested and has  days to live . lol . . . whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa  just backfires .  br    br   in the end  he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks . . . which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie .  br    br   definitely a gem  and totally original .  br    br   scott  

=======================================================================================================

43 ===> i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was . was the viewer supposed to learn something  or reflect on anything here  what was up with the pumpkins  was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots  does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel  why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews  it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery  . the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished .  br    br   i am truly amazed . i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community .  

=======================================================================================================

44 ===> verhoeven  s movie was utter and complete garbage . he  s a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed . by his own admission  he read  chapters of the book  got bored  and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch .  br    br   heinlein would have never supported that trash if he  d been alive to see it . it basically steals the name  mocks politics of the book  which is a good portion of it   and throws in some ta so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn  t get bored .  br    br   this anime isn  t perfect  but it  s at least mostly accurate  as best i can tell .  

=======================================================================================================

45 ===> the author sets out on a  journey of discovery  of his  roots  in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the  completely and deservedly forgotten  movie  bright leaf  is about an ancestor of his . its not  and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self  indulgent glorified home movie  suitable for screening at  the director  s  drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial  or even non  commercial release . a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios  because they are boring  irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his  her immediate circles . avoid at all costs   

=======================================================================================================

46 ===> wow . what a wonderful film . the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei  i hope he has more stories in him .  br    br   the acting is sublime . renying zhou as doggie was amazing   very natural talent  and xu zhu was a delight  very believable as the jaded old traditionalist .  br    br   the soundtrack was very effective  guiding without being overwhelming .  br    br   if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong  a family friendly  well acted  well written  well directed  near perfect gem .  

=======================================================================================================

47 ===> now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have . wow some demented pokmon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this . animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the pokmon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film . it is just an animation it should be on video .  br    br   ps i  ll give it a  because i just got  bucks i could not give it a half because there  s no halves .  

=======================================================================================================

48 ===> this is a superb movie  suitable for all but the very youngest  though accessibility for younger people was marred  at least in the print which i saw  by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub  titling  for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time  period it is set  there is no modern technology shown  not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle  just a drab  almost monochrome  everyday life  against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks . even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war  this could still be any time in the past    years .  br    br   but then we briefly see a motor car  late   s  early   s style  and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals  and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war  and the communist revolution .  br    br   which makes the central character  s desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant .  br    br   but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today  both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls  men and women the trade  for various purposes  in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendship .  br    br   maybe i  m reading too much into this film but i don  t think so  i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom  whilst dross is passed off as quality material .  br    br   but don  t get me started on that . . .  

=======================================================================================================

49 ===> i recently watched this again and there  s another version which is shorter     . i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference .  br    br   one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with . ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice    br    br   prof ivy was rather boring . she sounded as if she was almost asleep  no expression at all with the few lines she had .  br    br   this was enjoyable enough but there wasn  t much to it at all .  br    br   a collector  whos after lugia  he has no plan to destroy the world  and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction .  br    br   the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better  deoxys  poke   is great  with no .  almost here .  

=======================================================================================================

50 ===> this movie was excellent . a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes . this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie . you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way  doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions . this equals on big happy movie in the end . this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be  so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets . you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture . the cinema  photography is excellent  in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers . bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film .  

=======================================================================================================

51 ===> this is an awful film . yea the girls are pretty but its not very good . the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn  t get in the way . well  okay it might be interesting  but its not  because its so badly paced and and only partly acted . i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen  probably more laughable then they do on tv .  i won  t even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest . never read about that in the old west  this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward .  br    br   i like schlock films but this is ridiculous . there is a reason that i don  t go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good  the plot taking a back seat to breasts . the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats . the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent . the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level  infantile but harmlessly fun . something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie .  br    br   the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film .  br    br   i need not watch this again .  br    br   of interest to probably no one  the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil  a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped .  br    br   obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives .  

=======================================================================================================

52 ===> as i was watching this film on video last night  i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure . i  ve a feeling i  ll be watching this again and again for years to come .  br    br   it  s got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story  film . and even though some cultural references are obscure for me  a western viewer  at the core this is a universal tale .  

=======================================================================================================

53 ===> i saw this film at its premier at sundance   .  br    br   since american beauty is a movie that had something to say  i had hopes for towelhead . unfortunately  it was a disappointment . in fact  of countless movies i  ve seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals  towelhead is the only sundance movie i  ve ever wanted to walk out early from .  br    br   the worst problem with towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of  provocative  concepts concerning cultural stereotypes  rather than with an organic human drama . the screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by alicia erian . the famous edith wharton quote comes to mind i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author  s political views . that observation is especially devastating for towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic . if there ever was a time when towelhead  s white male villains  condescending portrayals of blacks  ironic treatments of foreign cultures  etc .  were fresh  it  s long past .  br    br   for a more detailed review  please look up any of the many professional reviews available online . almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on .  br    br   on the other hand  the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled . as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites  you  ll frequently come across superlatives  stunning    breathtaking    profound    shocking   . . . it embarrasses me to read them  but it does not surprise me . indeed  i  ve encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial  cultural  gender  or sexual issues as deeply moving  thought provoking  full of profound insight . if you are such a person  by all means  rent towelhead and be moved by it . on the other hand  if you set your standards higher  you can safely pass on this one .  

=======================================================================================================

54 ===> one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find  if you are lucky  in the video stores  is they are very accurate retellings of actual  true stories . farewell  my concubine  the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples . the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience   the hallmark of much hollywood  and especially disney films .  br    br   in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art . along an having lost his only son many years earlier  he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work . master wang is sold a son by a slave trader . all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art . but the son eventually is found out to be a girl . from there  the story get very interesting  with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera   a regional operatic style related to peking opera . fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liang  s portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera . it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati  but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality .  

=======================================================================================================

55 ===> the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movie for teens  this one is a very bad copy . the change is only in the sex . in the first one the good one was sandy  here it  s michael . i prefer to watch the first grease .  

=======================================================================================================

56 ===> beautiful and touching movie . rich colors  great settings  good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while . i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china . my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too .  

=======================================================================================================

57 ===> well  at least my theater group did  lol . so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl  while it was never my favorite musical or story  it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it  s still a lot of fun to watch . i heard horrible things about grease  and that  s why i decided to never watch it  but my boyfriend said that it really wasn  t all that bad and my friend agreed  so i decided to give it a shot  but i called them up and just laughed . first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn  t really clever  not to mention they just used the same characters  but with different names and actors . tell me  how did the pink ladies and t  birds continue years on after the former gangs left  not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy  gee  what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t  birds were just stupid and ridiculous .  br    br   another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasn  t stopped . but when a new student who is sandy  s cousin comes into the scene  he is love struck by a pink lady  stephanie . but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t  birds  so the new student  decides to train as a t  bird to win her heart . so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the t  bird  s butts . but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own  well  find out for yourself .  br    br   grease  is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn  t work . the gang didn  t click as well as the first grease did  not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable  because i thought that she graduated from rydell  but apparently she didn  t . the songs were not really that catchy i  m glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast  but that  s probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel  i wouldn  t really recommend this film  other than if you are curious  but i warned you  this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

58 ===> i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the     s in this beautiful film . the story is simple . an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children . the faces of the actors are marvelous to see . the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well . the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine  which was more sophisticated and intricate . the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel . the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism  humanity  and history portrayed .  

=======================================================================================================

59 ===> i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial  minutes of the film . i managed to stomach      minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead  which  by the way  is great fun  .  br    br   the story has massive holes in it . the plot line is hugely over stated and dull  the acting is awful  especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at  looking daft and singing like a castrato  . morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable  especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet . freeman and timberlake  s characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father  son relationship of sorts or something  which simply isn  t evident at all apart from the fact that though freeman  s character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake  he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up .  br    br   it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line  which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion .  br    br   don  t watch this film  it is a pure waste of time .  

=======================================================================================================

60 ===> this is a beautiful  rich  and very well  executed film with a rich and meaningful story . basically  it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a  male  heir to carry on his craft  but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male  dominated world . the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society  s traditional notions .  br    br   the story is fun  emotional  and complex . the exploration of the characters  their lives  and emotions  is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all . the film expertly conveys the old man  s emotions and his desire to find an heir  and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation . there is also humour  sometimes quite subtle  at appropriate points . the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture  creating further interest and depth to the film .  br    br   the directing  acting  and scenery are all outstanding . added to the other strengths  this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling  real characters . as a result  the film evokes strong empathy for  and feelings about  the characters .  br    br   some have claimed that the ending weakens the film  but i do not necessarily agree . perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending  but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small .  

=======================================================================================================

61 ===> i laughed all the way through this rotten movie . it  s so unbelievable . a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage  has a breakdown in front of a real estate office . what happens  the office manager comes outside and offers her a job    hilarious  next thing you know the two women are going at it . yep  they  re lesbians  nothing rings true in this  lifetime for women with nothing better to do  movie . clunky dialogue like  i don  t want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn  t take it  doesn  t help . there  s a wealthy  distant mother who disapproves of her daughter  s new relationship . a sassy black maid  unbelievable that in the year      a film gets made in which there  s a sassy black maid . hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave . the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids . sheesh  no cliche is left unturned .  

=======================================================================================================

62 ===> this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen . it shows a china i had never seen or imagined  and i believe it shows      s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie . it is absolutely heart  breaking in so many situations  seeing how hard life was for the characters  and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful . you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film . the actors are all perfect  such that you feel like you have really entered a different world .  br    br   i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough . it may just change you forever once you have seen it .  

=======================================================================================================

63 ===> why do all movies on lifetime have such anemic titles   an unexpected love   ooh  how provocative    this much i know  would have been better . the film is nothing special . real people don  t really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed . the straight woman who  turns  lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character . if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion  you might enjoy this . although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn  t really get out in the world to observe people . why am i wasting my time writing about it   

=======================================================================================================

64 ===> fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest   br    br   the sfx are very good for a movie of its age  and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors  even down to body type  a rarity in movies of this vintage .  br    br   a cozy movie  with splendid panoramas   even when chopped down to pan and scan .  

=======================================================================================================

65 ===> i am an actor  producer  director and what i am about to say are facts . this project was the worst film in movie making history . from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke . why would blockbuster released such crap  i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession . was the director trying to make a bad movie  i don  t think so . i seen bad zombie movies  but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table . this movie sucks    i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself  but please consider in taking up a different profession . i respect the fact that you completed a movie  but i have to ask you  were you smoking crack   i mean the makeup on your girls  the scary zombies  what were you thinking . to the whole nation  if i could have voted zero i would have . worst film in movie making history     

=======================================================================================================

66 ===> i got in to this excellent program in about season  and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of  and   . it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after   seasons . sadly now the sci  fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a   season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more . atlantis is still going strong on its  th seasons . and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead . this tv show is a must see for all sci  fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it            

=======================================================================================================

67 ===> this movie is a joke . i mean a  ha ha  funny joke . why  because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical  inane plot and horrible acting . wow   br    br   within this movie there are so many unanswered questions . . . for example why do these women become zombies and how  why are there four black women who are zombie  s  caretakers  and what is their purpose  since when does  people make up a  nation  of zombies  and is smeared black eye mascara  scary  to anyone  anywhere  even a  year old   br    br   and lastly why was this movie made at all  why  why  why  no answer  that  s what i thought .  br    br   on the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie we apologize for this movie in advance  lol . at least they had the decency to do this much   

=======================================================================================================

68 ===> the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser  known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon  current day sri lanka  . upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd . william dieterle  who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie  does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark  and almost eerie  undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i  ve seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery .  

=======================================================================================================

69 ===> i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie . it was so bad . i was totally fooled by the box art . don  t be fooled   its not worth your time i promise you . i don  t know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what . i am so disappointed .    br    br   the description on the back of the box doesn  t even match  the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper . the synopsis on the back says she is only   . did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it   those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be . if anyone actually liked this flick then i  ve lost all faith in humanity .  br    br   and don  t even get me started on the story compared to the title . or the fact that the entire movie was done all in  locations . or that the cops didn  t even have close to real uniforms . why would i even say that   who cares about the cops uniforms   compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on .  br    br   this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans .  

=======================================================================================================

70 ===> my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old . i have never forgotten it . i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor .  she was twenty  two when she made elephant walk  remember  i  m nine  so the feelings aren  t sexual  i just couldn  t see anything else on the screen . i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her . she has begun to show her age   she  s almost seventy  four  but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived .  br    br   i have seen the movie several times since  and it is a sappy melodrama . what saves it is  of course  miss taylor  s beauty  magnificent scenery  the very impressive elephant stampede  and a well  made point on human arrogance in the face of nature .  br    br   all in all  a well  spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video .

71 ===> this film has to be the worst i have ever seen . the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope . the story line of the film is laughable at best  with the acting so poor you just have to cringe . the title  zombie nation  implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total . this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy    s music when the zombies  attack  . the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video . if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so  then burn the copy .

72 ===> dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt  one of the most amazing shows ever produced  but not just in the field of animation . while the first part  acts  and   mostly consists of action and fun  the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part . the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant . you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part  acts   and   . i do have some complaints though . in the first part  the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all . one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool . buaku rules .

73 ===> thank god  i didn  t waste my money renting it but i downloaded it  this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life  fg visual effects  unnecessary gore and nudity  far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others . there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie . ok if you get time after reading this comment  please check out the director  s  ulli lommel  profile . after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this  i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between  and  . and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him  but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence . even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie .

74 ===> scott bartlett  s  offon  is nine minutes of pure craziness . it is a full  frontal assault of psychedelic  pulsating  epilepsy  inducing flashing lights and colours  and the first true merging of film and video in avante  garde cinema . there  s no story to speak of  but bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions  integrating these biological phenomena into the highly  industrial form of modern technology . in a sense  the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools  his machinery  his technology . this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal     in stanley kubrick  s       a space odyssey         and  indeed  bartlett  s opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a close  up human eye  recalls dave bowman  s journey through the stargate . the visuals are richly  coloured  a confronting blend of sharp  vivid photography and increasingly  grainy video  as though we  re sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact  the end product was recorded from a tv monitor .  br    br   there appears to be some confusion about the film  s release date . imdb lists the film as a     release  but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give     as the correct year . perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film  s completion and its first public screening . either way  the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time  occasionally reminiscent of a     s music video  and some brisk techno music wouldn  t have gone amiss  either   offon  captures grainy  fragmented images  presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information . i had a thought  and please don  t laugh at this free  thinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth  s television signals might very well receive such a disjointed  alien documentation of human life  a bizarre montage of only vaguely  familiar imagery that couldn  t possibly make any coherent sense . perhaps this is where mankind  with all his technology  is eventually heading  towards an irreversible merging of film and video  of purity and artificiality .

75 ===> usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant . . . i tend to support everybody  because their efforts are worth . . .  br    br   but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits   br    br   imagine the following situation  br    br    . think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far .  br    br    . think about some great  attractive art for that movie  s dvd box . . . and a promising plot . . .  br    br    . voil  you got zombie nation .  br    br   see it only if you really don  t have anything else better to do . anything is better .

76 ===> i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it  but have seen it  or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical  comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence . kay kyser  s mysteries would be a good example .  br    br   having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show  as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action  doing a fine job of support . hugh o  brien plays the face  buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus  abbott and costello replacing the leads . don  t know if that was true .  br    br   all in all  a pleasant movie  but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history . wish that it was released  as i haven  t seen or heard of it now in two decades . hope it is not lost

77 ===> this movie had me going . the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard . i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors  band together  and plan to take out the zombies . dead wrong  it  s about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what  s coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge . as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved . where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation .  br    br   first off  the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face . what are zombies but mindless  debatable intelligent  cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs  these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models  they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies . sure the eating and killing is there  but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement  although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre  it makes fun of that genre and asks the question   why can  t zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines   i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies . i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much  it  s an insult and as for scarynot even .

78 ===> directed by govind nihalani  this is definite cop film of indian cinema . may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force  politics with no holds barred  how it effects on a young cop . a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father . agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop  bad cop hindi films but this is different . today  s generation  which grown up watching dark  realistic films like   satya    company  may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making . the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn  t pay much attention to such kind of cinema  yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class  mass audience when it released . for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema  he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar . its more than cop character  he internalized a lot which is something original in acting . watch his scenes with his father whom he hates  smita whom he loves . smita patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level . my god what a natural expressions she carried    shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me  he  s a brilliant character actor if given a chance  here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om . the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen  sadashiv amrapurkar as  rama shetty  . it  s another story that he didn  t get such a meaty role  almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendra  s b grade action films . watch the scene where om  st time becomes a rebel for his father  played by amrish puri   next both are sharing wine together . how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love  hate for each other . two faces of indian police force  masculinity  impotency and in between lies  half truth  ardh satya  kudos to nihalani  s touch . the film won  national awards as best hindi feature film  best actor  om puri   filmfare awards in best film  best director  best supporting actor categories .  br    br   recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi films .  br    br   ratings

79 ===> yeah  i  m sure it really could be a nation . . . if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times . man  i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear . net instead of renting it . i  m a big fan of the george romero movies and i  m pretty sure that if he saw this movie  he  d probably throw up while laughing too hard . i mean  what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie  s devils  it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer  especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop  police station  apartment  flat  whatever room it was with the gong in the background  and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop . i couldn  t even tell what nationality the killer was  and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn  t help either . oh well  what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world . so  for all of those who worship mystery science theater     or if you just like reaming on bad c movies  c for craptastic   then this is the movie for you . . . or not .  

=======================================================================================================

80 ===> an absolute classic   the direction is flawless  the acting is just superb . words fall short for this great work . the most definitive movie on mumbai police . this movie has stood the test of times .  br    br   om puri gives a stellar performance  smita patil no less . all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment . this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society .  br    br   this is the story of a cop  om puri  who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer . the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops . kudos to nihalani    br    br   after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal  politician  police nexus . thus this movie was truly a trend setter . this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade .  br    br   this movie was a moderate box office hit .  br    br   a must  see for discerning movie fans .

81 ===> btk killer  green river killer  zodiac killer the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is  he loves his crap .  br    br   i  ve never seen a ulli lommel film but i was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful . like the movies i said in the beginning don  t even equal a six when added together  after reading the comments i was curious to see how bad this guy really is . he is the worst out there .  br    br   the credits wouldn  t end as the pathetic movie started and quickly i noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in . the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots . the editing is easily the worst . this movie made no sense and i unbearably couldn  t take it anymore as it wouldn  t end and i was only   minutes in the movie . i couldn  t take it anymore . i wasted   minutes of my life .  br    br   do not watch this crap

82 ===> any story comprises a premise  characters and conflict . characters plotting their own play promises triumph  and a militant character readily lends oneself to this . ardh satya  s premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre . the line goes   ek palde mein napunsaktha  doosre palde mein paurush  aur teek tarazu ke kaante par  ardh satya   . a rough translation   the delicate balance of right  wrong  commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts  has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another . is the needle on the center a half  truth    br    br   the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant . it makes a deep impact on the protagonist  lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow . at the end of the film  om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem .  br    br   the film tries mighty hard to do a one  up on the poem . however  chitre  s words are too powerful  and at best  the film matches up to the poem in every aspect .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

83 ===> horrible acting  bad story line  cheesy makeup  and this is just the tip of the iceberg . i have never seen a worse movie in my life   minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen . . . it didn  t .  aside from a nice breast shot  the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse  and the same warehouse was used for at least    of the sets . you even see this same red chair in several different  locations  if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment  not some warehouse which will echo all your actor  s dialog . .  note to producers  renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse  and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable  if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee . . . you will be demanding your money back . . . i only spent   .   to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off .

84 ===> i loved this film . not being a swooning ed wood jr . fan  i prefer to appreciate his  boundless enthusiasm  and acknowledge his shortcomings . his movies are fun  but his personal story is one racked with pain . i hoped  and was delighted to find  that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life  rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise . from beginning to end  this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology  leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr .  br    br   what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives  positive and negative  and showing us their character as much as ed  s . we get insight into ed  s personal and professional life from his romances  to his drinking  to his sexuality  to his friends  to his enemies  and even to his film making .  br    br   the film itself is shot in a low  budget way that seems done out of respect for ed  as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from     would be disrespectful  sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president  . the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background .  br    br   fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies  and new comers will be amazed that this man was real . the dvd is full of impossible to find gems   crossroads of lorado  and photo galleries   but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story .  br    br   ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him  for better or worse   to the point where one woman will go down in history as  swimming pool owner  for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool . this ability to define a person  s legacy comes through universally  as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr .  but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created . somehow  without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time  the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear  and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement .  br    br   even the title hints at the b  list horror genre  but by the end  we see that even this is a kindness . what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood  s legend .  br    br   in many ways a living contradiction  ed wood jr . could not be condensed to a single viewpoint . this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get . being itself a juxtaposition of themes  it is at once respectful  provocative  thoughtful  gripping  fun  sad  kind  and fulfilling .  

=======================================================================================================

85 ===> this is one of the worst films ever . i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful . where are the images in the film that are on the box  i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film .  br    br   why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading  i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box . as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store . i have no one to blame except myself . i want my money and time back .  br    br   do not watch this movie .  br    br   even if curiosity is motivating you  stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead . it will be much more enjoyable . you have been warned   

=======================================================================================================

86 ===> an excellent and accurate film . . . mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off . he is not afraid to tell the truth  even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy .  br    br   once again  mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston  though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough . i found this movie as accurate  well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing . well done and my hat is off to the writer  the actors  the production crew . a great film

87 ===> wow . i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem . i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood . i brought it home and put it on .  br    br   this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind . this was much worse . i wanted a bad movie but what i got  i didn  t know that crap like this existed amongst man . this movie seemed like a  year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it .  br    br   i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies . he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs .  br    br   if you are thinking about renting this or buying it . i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide .  don  t do it  it  s not worth it   i really have nothing nice to say about this movie . don  t do it   

=======================================================================================================

88 ===> anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike  s work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director . in keeping with miike  s working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script  this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller  with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with . what takes the movie out of the realms of the same  old same  old however  is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today  s cinema . and this isn  t that nice cool  clean violence so beloved of us cinema  this stuff is nasty  painful and hurts  that said  the pace is breakneck  the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities  miike  s sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments  and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be  making it hard to look away from the screen  whatever he might be showing you  it doesn  t have the  ohmigod  ending of  dead or alive   but if you  re not squeamish  now  s the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio  s  new john woo  shopping list . . .  

=======================================================================================================

89 ===> ll cool j . morgan freeman . dylan mcdermott . kevin spacey . john heard . cary elwes . roslyn sanchez . justin timberlake   wait a minute . justin timberlake  and he  s the star  i should have known better than to rent edison force . in fact  i did know better . but in a moment of absolute weakness  i rented this stv . when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv  you know it  s one of two things an indie or a dog . as in sat  on  a  shelf . which this did . and with good reason . the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force  and  journalist  timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them . he is targeted for his efforts   or maybe i should say for his horrible acting . i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing . just awful . the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard  looking like nothing so much as a hobo . you just know the director was not in control . freeman is clearly slumming .  

=======================================================================================================

90 ===> while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike  s later films this is a very good crime drama .  br    br   the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster . complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang . the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust . its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film .  it is a very very good one  this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don  t mind a no frantic pace .  br    br   a word of warning  the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty . there are also semi  graphic depictions of gay sex . if thats not your cup of tea  proceed with caution .  br    br    or  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

91 ===> yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation . as with juno and the paycock  you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie . there is almost no style or craft to it at all . the story revolves around fred and emily  a young married couple  who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage . emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted  wealthy man who falls in love with her  but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband . this might seem more believable if fred weren  t made out to be a completely insensitive  pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman . the couple ends up staying together  but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene . the third act goes in a completely different direction  with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat . joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband . that  s about all you can say for this one .  

=======================================================================================================

92 ===> shinjuku triad society  albeit from perfect  is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber  conventional realm . it  s a yakuza  triad picture  involving cops versus japanese   or chinese gangsters  mostly chinese  as the title suggests   but already even in his first technical  debut   takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here  on in . social issues like black market trading of precious goods  in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one  s roots  which was especially prevalent in dead or alive   thumbing  of  the  nose at taboos like gay sex and  satirical  rape  violence towards women blood  curdling violence . it  s certainly not as surreal as some of miike  s most recent films  but this is expected as he  s trying out things that he  s just starting to learn  following a track record of straight to video programmers . it  s got all of those qualities  and it  s also  like the films that would follow from it  equally savage and heartfelt  crazy  in spots  and sardonic in its drama  and solid for genre fans .  br    br   the story concerns two brothers  one a chinese orphan raised in japan  tatsuhito kiriya  kippei shiina  pretty decent as a eastwood  esquire anti  hero  hero   who  s become a detective  and another  who  s become a gangster  or a would  be one . the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang  a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare  time  played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes   and his partner karino  takeshi caesar  who  s threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who  s just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal   who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie . there  s some intrigue involving the organ  trading scheme with the gangsters  which kiriya almost becomes a victim of  and the gang  s penchant for gay sex  at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want . it all leads up to vengeance and redemption  qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare  hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying  it won  t come off   .  br    br   if it doesn  t add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have  it  s par for the course of a film like this . miike  s goals are met  though just met  in his low  scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble  the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents   notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime  and what the realm of unrepentant sex  with both sexes  brings out psychologically in the characters . at the same time  shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black  comedy from the miike oeuvre . some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness  like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face  or the randomness of the  interrogation  as it goes into a very twisted area . there  s even a laugh  out  loud line from the young sex  slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses  thank you  mr . weeny  burger .  miike and his writer don  t have enough here to make the film a full  on dark comedy like ichi or  of course  visitor q  but there  s enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters .  br    br   as the first entry of the  black society  trilogy  as it  s called  i was quite impressed  and it  s a fine quasi  calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema .

93 ===>  . . . this would have been what you got .  br    br   words alone cannot describe how bad this is . if you  re having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you  ll be out in fifteen minutes .  br    br   robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the   s   but he  s phoning it in here . in an interview  johnny  duncan  robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight  duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder   in fact he  s more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape .  br    br   driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest al  s used car lot at below sticker price   the dynamic duo don  t put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it  s bruce wayne  s car they  re driving   in fact it  s noted by several characters throughout the serial .  br    br   the acting is wooden   the sets are cheap   the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i  m sure it read along the lines of  batman says something here  because it certainly seems like they  re making it up as it goes along .  br    br   batman  s utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets   in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts   never to be seen again . his cowl is so bad he can  t even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike .  br    br   in one scene  i am not making this up   batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods . it  s radioactive so he can trace it   the reason it  s so highly flammable isn  t explained . well  unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse   we know it  s a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out   and soon the whole place burns to the ground . thanks batman   br    br   in another scene after the batmobile is disabled  batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car   leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one  yes  you guessed it  said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds . not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham city .  br    br   there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman   she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruce  s house   or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood .  br    br   everything about this serial is bad   and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen . if you  re looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark   if you want entertainment  try the burton batman films  the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial .

94 ===> this was the beginning of it all  granted  this is not friends at its best  but this was the show  s pilot  let  s not forget and not a bad one at that . we  re introduced to the gang and central perk  where our story begins . even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross  rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years  when ross says  i just want to be married again  and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on . . . probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica  joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back . something else . . in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes  the so  called  flashbacks  this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions . nevertheless  the point is this a fine start to a great show . this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them  with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was  keep watching  first season is a blast    

=======================================================================================================

95 ===> he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero  s acting and the hole thing was . . . . . . . . . . . . . i can  t believe that steven segal  s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making  th rate films with  th rate secondary actors . i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .  br    br   the plot is unbelievable as a movie  and even if you excuse the visuals  and had read this story as a novel  you  d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .  br    br   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . he shows no effort and no enthusiasm  and in some scenes he doesn  t show up at all .  br    br   i hate to repeat other peoples comments  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . the condition of those scenes chopped in  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .  br    br   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . i read one review that said the movie had a   million dollar budget  segal being paid  of that  and that the movie still came in under budget . i must concur .  br    br   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie  as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

96 ===> stargate sg   is a spin off of sorts from the     movie  stargate .  i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject . the show gets it rolling from the very first episode  a retired jack o  neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion  dr . daniel jackson . through the first two episodes  we meet samantha carter  a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her  and there is teal  c  a quiet  compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team .  br    br   the main bad guys are called the gouald  they are parasites who can get inserted into one  s brain  thus controlling them and doing evil deeds . any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a  system lord .  the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa  who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person  s brain .  br    br   through the episodes  we mostly get to see sg    the exploratory team comprised of jack  daniel  teal  c  and sam  go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets  this device is called the stargate  and they encounter new cultures or bad guys . some episodes are on  world  meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth .  br    br   through the years  you start to see a decline in the sg   team as close knit  and more character  building story lines . this  in turn means even more on  world episodes  which is perfectly understandable .  br    br   my rating  .          while most of this show is good  there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years . but still  top notch science fiction   

=======================================================================================================

97 ===> i own almost every seagal movie  yes even ones like this that are low budget   and i must say  this may be the worst  not only of his movies  but of all movies ever made . the only highlight of this film  and only reason i gave it  stars instead of   is that a . it is seagal  and b . seagal does have some sweet action sequences  specifically in the store  and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife . next time give me   minutes of seagal killing people  and don  t even bother with a story line  because the storyline not only stunk  but so did the acting  the fact that f     s and f     s somehow changed into f    s  and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f    . also the stealth never had to refuel    and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point . last i checked  afghanistan has no air force  we  usa  control the skies . also  this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room  yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret . also  how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck  to the top  please tell us why they jailed him  since when are air force pilots great commandos  unless they are owen wilson   and since when are their drunks in arab countries  considering muslims don  t drink alcohol  also on top of that  since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the   in charge  the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store  and the other   people he killed with a knife  as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere .  

=======================================================================================================

98 ===> in this first episode of friends  we are introduced to the  main characters of the series monica geller  phoebe buffay  chandler bing  ross geller  joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green .  br    br   we discover that rachel  a rich girl that is monica  s friend from high school times  left her fianc  barry  at the altar  since she discovered she didn  t love him . she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father  getting a new job as a waitress in central perk .  br    br   ross  for the other hand  discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan  her partner .  we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode   br    br   monica  in this episode  makes out  and eventually sleeps  with paul  the wine guy   who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife . but in reality  he was just deceiving her .  br    br   ps i just loooove joey  s and chandler  s haircuts in this first season     

=======================================================================================================

99 ===> unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under  minutes .  br    br   the plot  even for a seagal film  the plot is just stupid . i mean its not just bad  its barely coherent .  br    br   the acting  unbelievably wooden . literally seen better acting in porno  s . ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a  lesbian love scene  which is utterly cringe  worthy .  br    br   special effects  wouldn  t look out of place in a    s sword and sorcery flick .  br    br   unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures  don  t make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd  as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back .  

=======================================================================================================

100 ===> what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining .  right to die  is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore .  br    br   spoilers here  br    br   top credits also go to the dead  on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen . playing the character in a great  aloof  fashion  you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails . corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not  so  good  guy who gets his just desserts .  br    br   end of spoiler .  br    br   as a revenge  from  the  dead flick   right to die  benefits heavily from it  s performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour .  

=======================================================================================================

101 ===> nobody could like this movie for its merit but  if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their mst  quality  then this is for you . it ranks up there with  road house  for its preposterous characters  sets and story line . the bad writing really cracked me up  i want you to dust those guys off  instead of  . . . dust those guys .  f    s take off from the carrier but  when they get into formation  they  re f    s  without a hint of anger or skepticism  segal goes back to work for the general who  only minutes before  was overseeing a covert  mind wipe  on seagal . segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards . so naturally  the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too  the hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway . the little stealth fighter can fly all the way from california to afganistan without refueling . then segal flies it back to california  the long way  i . e .  by way of europe  even though there  s a carrier giving him air support   minutes away in the arabian sea . the cic in the carrier consists of  black pcs   flat screen tvs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls . what a hoot   

=======================================================================================================

102 ===> well its about time . i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season  s entries . while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries  at least this episode turned out well . its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season . in  right to die  we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey . at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation . abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back . while they speak  they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises  but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire . and this is just the setup people . once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes . there  s also a side effect too . every time she flatlines  abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people . hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever . from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it  right to die should have the right to go on living forever .  

=======================================================================================================

103 ===> you  ve gotta hand it to steven seagal whatever his other faults may be  he does have good taste in women . if you pick a seagal movie  chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it . and usually  they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight  shoot guns  kill with knives  etc .  flight of fury  offers the duo of ciera payton  who has a very sexy face  with luscious lips to match angelina jolie  s  and katie jones  and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling  and if it seems like i  m spending a little too much time talking about them  it  s because the rest of the movie  although passable  is so unexciting that it  s hard to find much else to talk about . ironically  the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself  who looks as if he can  t even be bothered to try to pretend to care . this being a military  type actioner  there is very little fighting in it  and he doesn  t fit into his role  a stealth fighter pilot   the best in the world   of course  very well  which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking .        

=======================================================================================================

104 ===> fans of the hbo series  tales from the crypt  are going to love this moh episode . those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on  will recognize this one right off the bat .  br    br   underrated indie favorite martin donovan  also an excellent writer  co  author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her  is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way . he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy  next  door  or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness . in the case of right to die  he takes the latter approach  and it definitely works .  br    br   donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist  robin sydney   much to the displeasure of his inconsolable  unforgiving spouse  abbey  julia anderson  . when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of  making up   and she  s horribly burned in a fire  he  s reluctant to pull the plug on her  not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy  corbin bernsen  looking the worse for wear these days .   br    br   but abbey  s never been one to give up without a fight  and that  s where the ec  theme of the episode comes in . cuckolded husbands  and wives  have always been the genre  s favorite subject matter for some spooky  and ooky  supernatural shenanigans  and this case is definitely no exception . if anything  the ramped  up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere .  br    br   and that  s not to mention that john esposito  s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist . you don  t realize as you  re watching that you only know half the story  until close to the end . . .  think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas  and you  re there .   br    br   not a bad effort  but not the best of the lot  either . at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction  especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed  as with most moh episodes  this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment  so the extremely squeamish need not apply .  

=======================================================================================================

105 ===> steven seagal  mr . personality himself  this time is the united states  greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military  . . who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base  later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station  if he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday  who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor . along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor  jannick  mark bazeley   john sands  seagal  will fly into enemy territory  receiving help from his arab lover  jessica  ciera payton  and a freedom fighter  rojar  alki david  once they are on ground . jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders  stone  vincenzo nicoli  and his female enforcer  eliana  katie jones   and sands must figure out how to not only re  take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter  but rescue him as well . and  maybe  sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained  rather  steve toussaint  in the process . sands has   hours until a general  s navy pilots bomb the entire area . on board the stealth  black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb  hoping to detonate it on the united states .  br    br   seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he isn  t slicing their throats with knives . the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead . the setting of afghanistan doesn  t hold up to scrutiny  . . nor does how easily seagal and co . are able to move about the area undetected so easily  and the plot itself is nothing to write home about . the movie is edited fast  the camera a bit too jerky . seagal isn  t as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes  unlike the good old days . one of seagal  s poorest efforts  and he  s as understated as ever  . . not a compliment  . even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film  s chief villains  tis a shame . he doesn  t even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way  . . sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around  but it  s not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close  ups  .  

=======================================================================================================

106 ===> this was a superb episode  one of the best of both seasons . down right horror for a change  with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes  if there is such a thing . a man  s wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck  in which he was driving . his airbag worked  her  s didn  t . she is burned beyond recognition  great makeup btw   and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft . but  even in a coma  she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology  and when she does die for a few minutes  her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit . carnage of course ensues  and also some extremely gory killings  and also  some extremely sexy scenes . what more could you ask for  you might ask  well  not much  because this baby has it all  and a very satirical ending  that should leave a smile on most viewers faces . i just loved rob schmidt  s  wrong turn  direction too  he has a great knack for horror . excellent episode  this is one i  m buying for sure .  

=======================================================================================================

107 ===> as steven segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel . his best was just fodder for bored teenagers . this one tips the scales  then falls off . the characters are all cardboard . the story is double lame . i can  t spoil it by telling you the ending . you already know how all steven segal movies end if you have seen one . here goes . he is a super  dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide  instead of killing him  to dope his brain until he don  t remember squat . he escapes  of course  gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in afghanastan by a rogue air force pilot who  surprise  surprise  segal trained . all the heroes  except segal  s character and his dusky girlfriend  die heroically and steve  baby save the whole world in one swell foop  or fell swoop . whatever . made with some surplus air force and navy flying film . and a lot of boom  booms . get some popeye cartoons instead .  

=======================================================================================================

108 ===> as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known . the two leads always have to get together . late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together . a clue was given right from the start  but you  ll never realize it until the end . it  s a simple hook  but it works . it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground  but takes a fresh spin when ever possible . i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations . it  s a postcard of ny . also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it . so  if you like a good old fashion romantic movie . . . then this is for you .  

=======================================================================================================

109 ===> i usually don  t comment anything  i read the others opinions  . . . but this  this one i  have  to comment . . . i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action  f     and other hi  tech stuff  but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind . . . lousy acting  lousy script and a big science fiction .  br    br   it  s one of the worst movies i have ever seen . . .  br    br   simply . . . don  t bother . . .  br    br   and one more thing  before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site . . .  .  points and i give this movie a try  now i  m wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than  points            

=======================================================================================================

110 ===> a sweet funny story of  people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings . the ex  cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting  even though they are marrying other people . maybe a little trite in that the  partners  are both type a personalities  while our protagonists are much more relaxed . not anything heavy  but it made me smile . and hey for the guys  sell the natasha henstridge angle  and the gals  sell them the sappy romance  everyone wins   

=======================================================================================================

111 ===> timberlake  s performance almost made attack the screen . it wasn  t all bad  i just think the reporters role was wrong for him .  br    br   ll cool j played the typical rapper role  toughest  baddest guy around . i don  t think the cracked a smile in the whole movie  not even when proposed to his girlfriend .  br    br   morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie . he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie .  br    br   kevin spacey wasn  t good or bad he was just  there  .  br    br   overall it  s a dull movie . bad plot . a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors .  

=======================================================================================================

112 ===> a beautiful postcard of new york . the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear . it never did . my teenagers liked it too . my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan . my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something . this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done . the ending came with a twist which we all liked too . if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you . as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did . i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch .  

=======================================================================================================

113 ===> being a fan of cheesy horror movies  i saw this in my video shop and thought i would give it a try . now that i  ve seen it i wish it upon no living soul on the planet . i get my movie rentals for free  and i feel that i didn  t get my moneys worth . i  ve seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time  hell i  m a fan of them  but this was just an insult .  

=======================================================================================================

114 ===> this is the first michael vartan movie i  ve seen  i haven  t seen alias  and i was curious to see if the guy can act . he sure can and is likable in this movie . natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles  so i found her very good and lovable in this different  sweet  role of a schoolteacher . some of the negative comments i read are true  the movie is full of clichs and the story doesn  t ring true at all . also  even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together  i don  t think there is screen chemistry there . however  i enjoyed this movie . the locales are nice  the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good . if you are expecting to see a great romance  this is not it . but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good .  

=======================================================================================================

115 ===> i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film . one thing i see  over and over  is annoyance with megan  the idealistic political scientist  trying to change the world . i loved her character . maybe  because i am a   year old political science student and i think i  m going to change the world too  so i relate to megan . besides  she  s cute . she  s no super model  but more of a cute girl next door .  br    br   ok  so she cried and screamed a lot . it  s very dramatic  and seems overdone  but doesn  t it fit her character  she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point . she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick . i think she made her argument very well . of course  being a young naive girl  she is terrified of what she is about to face . i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear . furthermore  i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in .  br    br   as for the movie in general  other than megan  it was pretty much what i expected . it had excellent gore scenes  by micro  budget standards . the plot maybe took a quick thought  hardly any contemplation . it  s basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film  which the name implies . i love the sadism of the doctor . he kept ripping megan  s shirt off  not just for the cause of sleaze  though largely so   but also to torment her  before he kills her . the chainsaw hick was hilarious . for slasher film lovers  he was probably the best character .  br    br   i give this film  out of   . it had a good setting  almost no plot  and a mix of good and terrible acting . i would recommend it for a cheap thrill  but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro  budget horror .  

=======================================================================================================

116 ===> this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash  adorned in black  of course  who sings a lot and narrates a bit also . if you like johnny cash  this film is quite enjoyable . also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work . . . just for fun  try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair . . .  anyway  its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all .  

=======================================================================================================

117 ===> i couldn  t help but think of behind the mask the rise of leslie vernon  a massively more amazing film  when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea . this could have been a great film . the acting is . . . from some of the actors alright . from others . . . it  s downright horrible .  br    br   that aside the idea is great and the format is great . the story is pretty good as well  though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind .  br    br   nevermind that though right  it is a horror movie after all .  br    br   i really want to see this remade . . . i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be .  br    br   however  and you can  t really fault the minds behind the movie for this  this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget . and the fx really hurt the film overall .  br    br   great movie . . . . if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx .  br    br   whoever wrote it should keep going though  great idea here .  

=======================================================================================================

118 ===> i wait for each new episode  each re  run with anticipation  the new look of sci  fi created by stargate sg   is a wonder that i hope will never end . to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me . season   should be a thrill in itself . i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season  as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o  neill . the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner  season after season . you cancel this program in the next three years  and you make a serious mistake . also  you need a bigger role for the asgard  they are just too cool .

119 ===> a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza  s mgm contract at the time .  br    br   as reported by member lastliberal  above  grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off  and sometimes on  camera . in addition  his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable . after doing their second  and last  film together   toast of new orleans   the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b . mayer  s office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again  period . mayer felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza  so grayson  s statement stuck . grayson went on to star in a number of widely received  and far more profitable  musicals with howard keel and others . later in life when asked to compare lanza and keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them  and that keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the  real people  in the audiences .

120 ===> ah  i loved this movie . i think it had it all . it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times . yes  i am a girl  so i  m writing this from a girl  s perspective . i think it  s a shame it only scored  .  in rating . too many guys voting  it was far above other romantic comedies . just because i  m female i don  t enjoy all chic flicks  on the contrary i prefer other genres . romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be . but like i said  this movie had it all  almost  in my opinion . great script  good one  liners  fine acting . although eva longoria parker  s character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives  but so what  it was awesome . i will keep this film for rainy days  days when i feel low and need a few laughs .

121 ===> when thinking of the revelation that the main character in  bubble  comes to at films end  i am reminded of last years  machinist  with christian bale . the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters .  br    br   an understated  yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life . the title is cause for contemplation . perhaps  we  the audience are the ones in the  bubble  as we are given no payoffs in the films slim   minute running time . audience reactions were often smug and judgmental  clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves . these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w . back in office for a second term .  br    br   it  s sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role . this film has it  s merits  and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn  t say outright .  

=======================================================================================================

122 ===> actually my vote is a  .  . anyway  the movie was good  it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it  don  t misunderstand me  is not the funniest movie of the world  and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies  but this one has its own taste  a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends . . . i think that not exactly but who cares  also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic  chris rock appears in it  the name is down to earth  men  that one its a very funny movie  see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr . rock won with his movie . i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher  however  the film is good .

123 ===> if he wanted to be accurate  he should have chosen some frisco natives and not a bunch of ny actors who know nothing about the sucka free  not sucker free  . i  ve lived in sf my entire life  and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did . everything was over  dramatized  and the only cat i saw from the bay was jt the bigga figga with his little cameo as a rapper . no shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here  ie his warriors jersey  . not once did i notice anyone wearing any giants or  ers gear instead he fitted them in some cheesy made  up sf or oakland jerseys that aren  t even sold around here . hp has no bowling alleys  black and asian gangbangers do not wear head or wristbands with the colors of africa or china  s olympic team  nor does every chinese gangster wear a yao ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops . further  while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission  all that was shown was some white dude and a self  proclaimed      west coast boriqua .  this is not new york  puerto ricans here are few and far between  and the latinos in the mission are very  very different from the one that was shown here  who was without a doubt from ny . also  hp is not the only black neighborhood in the city . an accurate depiction would have shown the drama between hp sets in their own hood as well as vs . fillmore  sunnydale  lakeview  etc .  br    br   this film could  ve been much better if lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with .

124 ===> look it  s eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend . it  s gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore  sex panther cologne  in anchorman . if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies . however  if you are willing to suspend reality for   minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you  ve come to the right place . the characters are all funny . they work together very well . the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell . he  s as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time . i went with my wife  she enjoyed it and so did i .

125 ===> it  s      and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well  fans will be upset and certainly the       seats will be full  only less happy there are so many black players on the field  this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable . it  s not much more  but it  s really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance  for the time   probably most notably tom selleck . unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen  is quickly trumped by  actors  like dick butkus .  br    br   it  s a silly story about super bowl betting . pj jackson is charged by  new york   read mafia  for ensuring the game ends for their favor  in this case a            bet . pj is innocent enough  and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there . but things seem to fall apart for him . another person  the unsuspected lainie  takes charge . for a while  the mystery of murders isn  t known for certain  but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonist .  br    br   it  s a bad movie  but is watchable . the acting is decent  and the filming is ok . at least there weren  t any silly typical   s car chases  they have their place just not here  . just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you  ll survive .  br    br        maybe a  .

126 ===> in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review  this film actually was surprisingly good  i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichs  obvious jokes and overacting  all of which the trailer had promised .  br    br   however  after  minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting . with only one  toilet humour  gag  over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and  without spoiling anything too much  some of the moments involving animals are hilarious .  br    br   the staple ingredients of a good film are all there script  director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy  this film stands tall .  br    br   sure  you aren  t going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening  but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time

127 ===> comparison with american graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic . speaking of timeliness  there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie . they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong . there were sly reference such as  they paved paradise to put up a parking lot  . the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan .  br    br   the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers . almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie . very little of what the characters said were believable . combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail . although  there were two exceptions kelli williams liven things up as the future flower child and  despite what another reviewer said  rick shroeder was quite good . showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in  n . y . p . d . blues  .

128 ===> rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring  private snafu .  the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed  animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros .  termite terrace  including friz freleng  chuck jones  and carl stalling . the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu  and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel  i . e . dr . seuss . the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery  using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope  the little twerp who would do everything you  re not supposed to do . according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials  but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes  certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow   all for the greater good  of course .  br    br   as the title would indicate  this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors . the setting is an army camp . private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine  something you won  t see in any other hollywood films of the era  and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling . we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted  then exaggerated  then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp . the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot  while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air  i . e  balloon juice .  a soldier  shoots his mouth off   cannon  style  and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction . winged baloney  at that . panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized  coney island wiped out  enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn  and the japanese are in california . the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for  rumor  itis  and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell .  br    br   this is a highly effective piece of work . the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy  and the message is still a valid one . in recent years we  ve seen that catastrophic events  real or imagined  can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances . because the technology has improved  the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e  mail  cellphones and blogging . consequently  rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn  t feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever .

129 ===> i saw this back in    when it was finally released . apparently because orion pictures was in bankruptcy  i think  the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier .  br    br   i have problem remembering details partly because i haven  t seen it in a long time  but i do remember it as a very dull movie . i kept debating whether to walk out of it . the store was not at all interesting or engaging . was a  rd rate america graffiti imitation .  br    br   none of the performances make it worth watching either . one of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating .

130 ===> tim krabbe is the praised author of  het gouden ei   a novel that was put on the screen twice   spoorloos  and  the vanishing   . one of the dutch writer  s more recent works is  de grot   a psychological thriller about two totally different men  egon and axel  who meet at a youth camp and  surprising enough  become friends for dear life . egon is a quiet  somewhat dull person  who spends his time studying and writing geography books . axel  on the other hand  is a charismatic  party  animal   a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday  s concern is to get a woman into his bedroom . from the moment they meet  axel has a strong influence on egon  while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything  such as reading thick books like egon   ultimately  egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself  which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country .  br    br   after having read the book last year  i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it . in my opinion  the book suffers especially from the complex structure . while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people  the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically  so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode . because of this  the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character  s background to really care for him or her . another complaint was the fact that the main characters  egon and axel  are a little stereotypical . egon is  the  dull intellectual  while axel is his exact opposite . in real life  such one  dimensional people rarely exist in books and films  they always seem to be there  taking away a lot of credibility .  br    br   despite all this  the film was a pleasant surprise  being much better than the book . the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography  humour and acting fedja van huet  egon  is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting  which is  in my opinion  the highest an actor can achieve  . the drawbacks of the film  however  are the same as the book  s mainly because the characters are one  dimensional  they are so predictable that it becomes annoying . guess who wrote the script  indeed  krabbe himself . it is obvious that this talented director  that  s what the movie makes clear anyway  is hampered by a deficient screenplay . perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

131 ===> this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen  the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film . i am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame   

=======================================================================================================

132 ===> de grot is a very good film . the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb  who also adapted this story for the screen . some really top  class acting  not only by van hut  but especially by marcel hensema  who mostly did tv  work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf . the film seems to kick of as a thriller  and sets an excellent mood . then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf  and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash  back structure  which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character  driven drama of the movie . in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending  that will grab audiences by their throats . make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie . a must  see  especially if you liked  spoorloos   the vanishing  s original screen adaptation  .  

=======================================================================================================

133 ===> oh dear god . this was horrible . there is bad  then there was this . this movie makes no sense at all . it runs all over the map and isn  t clear about what its saying at all . the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman . the fact that  edison  isn  t a real city  takes away . since i live in vancouver  watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable . why didn  t they make it a real city  the only writing that was decent was  tilman  in which john heard did a fantastic job . he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy . it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time  and the movie be a washout . too bad . hopefully someone important will see it  and at least give john heard credit where credit is due  and hire him as lead bad guy again  which is where he should be . on the a list .  

=======================================================================================================

134 ===> i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought  hey  another film starring aishu and shah rukh  little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just   minutes . shakti is a film about a mother  s love and endurance . it  s a film about transformations  ignorance  coming of age  stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life . the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie . it  s actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk  s drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze . he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day  dressed scantily and begins to seduce him . the title of the song is  ishq kamina   loosely translated as  love  s a bitch    and it is just plain smoking hot  don  t miss it .  

=======================================================================================================

135 ===> okay  just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie . well  at least i did . it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour . spoiler  br    br   it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants . the only problem is that her daughter  s friend is the girl in the way . she always wins the competitions  therefore pushing the mother further towards  eliminating  her . after talking to a  hitman   the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit . so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught .  br    br   the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening . don  t waste your time watching this .  br    br

136 ===> a strong woman oriented subject after long  director krishna vamsi  s shakti  the power  the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi  s first home  production . a story about a woman  s fight against harsh injustice .  br    br   the story of the film revolves around nandini  karisma kapoor  who lives in canada with her two uncles  tiku talsania  jaspal bhatti  . there she meets shekhar  sanjay kapoor   falls in love with him and they soon marry . their family is complete when nandini has a boy  raja  master jai gidwani  . but their happiness is short lived  as the news of shekhar  s ailing mother  deepti naval  makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india . and that  s when the problems start . from the moment they reach  br    br   india  both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere . they take a crowded train to reach shekhar  s village and when they finally reach the station  they have to catch a long bus drive to his village . the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never  ending drive . and unfortunately for them  a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus . fortunately  they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him . after that  they drive to the handing havel where shekhar   s father  narsimha  nana patekar  lives with his wife  deepti naval  . nandani realized that her father  in  law is in command as soon as she enters the place  but her only solace is her mother  in  law  s warm welcome .  br    br   living there  nandini learns of her father  in  laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him . the day she sees her father  in  law teach her son to throw a bomb  she loses it and lashes out against him  insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada . but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day  leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father  in  law . her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart  wrenching film .  br    br   what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie . the only drawback is ismail darbar   s music  which fails to rise above the script . the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena  which has been composed by anu malik . another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast . karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother . she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal . second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film . his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he  s shown his versatility once again with this role . sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors . deepti naval too is in top form and her pr  climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy . shahrukh  s cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he  s been pulled in to get the required star value . though his role was not really required  he  s done it well . overall  shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr  release hype is sure to get it a good opening . shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up . so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least  reels to better the impact . shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch

137 ===> way back in      a certain director had no idea about a galaxy  far away or near . he was trying to complete a movie with the title thx etc . this short is a remanufactured history of a certain george . i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it . this is merely an advertising promo for the director  actors  et . al . it has little intrinsic artistic value . it is a brochure . the lead playing george  is very fine  as is the leia character  and the ersatz darth character . all else is plain commercial dross . what a waste . still  it got the job done i guess . the rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time i guess . a brochure only .

138 ===> well  i  ll be honest it is not exactly a sholay . but you cant get a sholay every week . in fact  you could see distinct signatures of  not without my daughter   sally field       in this movie . however  as most  inspired  movies go  this one was a well  inspired one  well handled and well done . nana patekar  as usual  tends to overdo his hysterics  but all others are commendable . specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time  but she hasn  t lost any of her grace . in fact  she has performed much better that when i last saw her . another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age   br    br   all in all  a nice watch .

139 ===> this juvenile  bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens  bodies  desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years . how  by burning up gas and equating a fast  reckless car  or plane  with freedom .  br    br   the plot borrows heavily from mister rogers  neighborhood  if it were run my an oil conglomerate  and logan  s run  if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style  .  br    br   starring lee majors and burgess meredith this film is set in a post  gas  crisis world in which an all  powerful government doesn  t want you to  ahem  drive your car and burn gas . sort of the opposite of today  s enron  and  bush  oil  grabbing  suv  pushing government .  br    br   this juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable . but wait . . . there  s more . although the film is set in the future  we  re not shown any signs of future technology  beyond a return to bicycles  golf carts and horses . you will believe that the future looks . . . exactly like today . same clothing  same suburban houses  same green lawns as today and when the film was made . there are no solar panels  no windmills  no concessions to alternate energy .  br    br   the acting is flat and flavorless . even scenes which could have been gritty or moving  buddy  flick  honor  romance  horror . . . all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase .  br    br   continuity is lacking   the jet flown by burgess meredith  s character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again .  br    br   the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode .  br    br   even die  hard car  film and sf fans should avoid this film like month  old roadkill  unless you enjoy heckling exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero  s gas tank .

140 ===> the movie was sub  par  but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci  fi fans ideal program . the actors deliver and the special effects  for a television series  are spectacular . having an intelligent interesting script doesn  t hurt either .  br    br   stargate sg  is currently one of my favorite programs .  

=======================================================================================================

141 ===> after watching this on the mst  k episode  i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from . it seems to combine elements of logans run  farenheight     final sacrifice and at least several others . at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower .  br    br   i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot . like the fact that  even though gas is unavailable  there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations  and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f  race car going all the way across the country .  

=======================================================================================================

142 ===> this is the who at their most powerful . although before the masterwork who  s next  which would provide anthems like baba o  reily and wont get fooled again . this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the    s .  br    br   daltrey shows what being a front  man is all about  entwistle steady as ever .  br    br   moon is great  check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech  and see him playing  side saddle  whilst having a bass drum head replaced   br    br   townsend even looks like he  s enjoying himself occasionally   br    br   considering they took to the stage at  am no one in the crowd was asleep   br    br   there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in   years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one .  

=======================================================================================================

143 ===> with this film  bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film  s might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of  objectivity  . obviously  it is not . for one reason  many scenes  shot by pure chance  are obvious set  ups  when that poor goat  accidently  falls off the cliff  you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen   . for another  his concealing of one important information the hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film . that is  goitre  a sickness caused by lack of iodine  salt  . this goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had bunuel only took the time to make his research  heck  if he checked  cretinism  in a medical dictionary he  d have found  goitre   he might have ended up telling the truth about these people  still  doubtfully  . instead  with his film  he judges them constantly  talking about them as  cretins   again and again  dramatizing the action  setting  up scenes to create the spectacle  all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all  mighty objectivity . bunuel talks all the time in this film  not letting one word to the people he is filming . he talks for them and  even then  judges them . this piece is flawed to it  s roots  to it  s ideology and it  s a real shame it  s considered a great film .  

=======================================================================================================

144 ===> joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material  and almost always under appreciated . he  s been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero  and has the type of strong  solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him . baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor  and that  s what  s so great about him . he really seems to mean what he  s saying  regardless of how clich  obvious or silly  which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones  oliver reed and don stroud . it  s what made the walking tall trilogy work so well  and that same magic is here in final justice . this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the   s  and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era . by moving the action from texas to europe  there  s a real timeless quality that doesn  t jar you away from the action on screen . to be honest  i  ve always enjoyed the films of greydon clark  who is a no  nonsense director in the same vein as     s clint eastwood  and this is one of his best . final justice is one of the lost gems of the late   s  similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence . i suppose if they remake this with the rock  a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do .

146 ===> i  m grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once  moribund visayan film understorey .  panaghoy  is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular  that claims more speakers than tagalog  . the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines . downside the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist . the other item that i didn  t appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the  period  costume of the same character  and above all  his bright red kit  car that i suppose was meant to pass for a     s roadster . without those small yet glaring details   panaghoy  would  ve been at least a  out of   on my rating   daghang salamat  manoy cesar  addendum this film sure beats peque gallaga  s  oro  plata  mata   which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war . alos  there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg  s  the color purple  and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of  noli me tangere  .  

=======================================================================================================

147 ===> people  please don  t bother to watch this movie  this movie is bad  it  s totally waste of time . i don  t see any point here . it  s a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor . i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again .  

=======================================================================================================

148 ===> imdb lists this as     for some reason  but the other sources i  ve seen including the excellent program notes mark it as    . doesn  t really matter  except that it  s quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video  one of the first art works to merge the two apparently  in the context of the star gate sequence in      released the same year . pure abstraction isn  t really my thing  but i can take it in small doses and the super  saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers  rohrschach blots  birds  etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful . certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the   s  and deserves to be better known .  

=======================================================================================================

149 ===> an updated version of a theme which has been done before . while that in and of itself is not bad  this movie doesn  t reach the ring like the other  inherent and pure  evil ones do .  br    br   predictable  ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark . not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending .  

=======================================================================================================

150 ===> i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating  s some people have given it . it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated  now if you don  t like comic books or animation then of course you won  t like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me . though  if you are a fan of interesting  strong characters and heroic  sexy  women kicking butt and saving the world  hell  you will love this movie . i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie . quite anime  esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation . like titan a . e . meet  s the live action version of punisher . in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie .  

=======================================================================================================

151 ===> well  the writing was very sloppy  the directing was sloppier  and the editing made it worse  at least i hope it was the editing  . the acting wasn  t bad  but it wasn  t that good either . pretty much none of the characters were likable . at least   minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential . it was a great idea  but yet another wasted good idea goes by . it could have ended  different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending . and what wasn  t predictable was done so badly that it didn  t matter . the ending was not worth watching at all . sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies . the movie looked rushed also . the movie just wasn  t really worth seeing  and had i paid for it i would have been very mad . maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one . the movie over all was not horrifibly bad  but i wouldn  t reccomend it . i gave it  out of   b  c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character  justin i believe  the super smart one  . and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes . it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape  it was not pretty . anyway  if you see it  wait for the   .   theater or video  unless you like pretty much every movie you see  then i guess you  ll like this one .  

=======================================================================================================

152 ===> rented this one accidentally  it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting  didn  t find out until i got home  watched it anyways . absolutely fantastic  a wonderful movie  and one of my top three favorite of all time  i recommend it to everyone   br    br   the story is enjoyable and easy to follow  this could have been easily messed up  but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together .  br    br   the actors themselves are fantastic  displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job .  br    br   gotta find a copy somewhere . . . . . . . . . . .

153 ===> from director barbet schroder  reversal of fortune   i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class  and i recognised the leading actress  so i tried it  despite the rating by the critics . basically cool kid richard haywood  half nelson  s ryan gosling  and justin pendleton  bully  s michael pitt  team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them . investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie  the hyena  mayweather  sandra bullock  with new partner sam kennedy  ben chaplin   who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene  e . g . non  relating hairs . the plan doesn  t seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects  it is just a question of if they can sway them away . also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills  chris penn as ray feathers  r . d . call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst . d . a . al swanson . i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock  s rope with the murdering for a challenge thing  but this film does it in a very silly way  and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable . adequate   

=======================================================================================================

154 ===> seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers . perhaps it  s because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth  or are we missing something  i  d watch it again if i had some incentive .  br    br   so what  s a happenstance  to the french it is  le battement d  ailes du papillon  serendipity  fate  perhaps it  s an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings . we  ve all had these  it  s called life  but when looked at in this way  you begin to get the feeling that  random  might be more like  fated .   br    br   a  happenstance  in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble . all these incidents cause other events that . . . well you get the picture  dominoes . multiply those by   characters and an average of  each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen . and i think that there  s a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this . but then this is the magic world of cinema .  br    br   we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer  director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens . if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape  here  s the place to do it . or if you  re recovering from surgery and aren  t going anywhere anyway  this will engage you while your stitches are healing .  br    br    happenstance  will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following . stranger things have happened .  br    br   soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following  life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward .  if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences  meeting your first love  finding the perfect gift  your last auto accident  you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it .  br    br   that  s the answer  i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain  happenstance  to me .  

=======================================================================================================

155 ===> having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock  s performance in miss congeniality  i decided to give murder by numbers a shot . while decent in plucky  self  effacing roles  ms . bullock  s performance in  serious  roles  see hope floats  speed     days  leave much to be desired . her character is at the same time omniscient  confused  and sexually maladjusted  the sub  plot of sandra  s past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character  . the two teenage boys gave decent performances  although their forensics expertise and catch  me  if  can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream  we did it   chris penn as the all  too  obvious suspect is wasted here  as is ben chaplin  s token partner  love interest character .  br    br   spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside  the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv  of  the  week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place  and as mentioned  the stupid errors  vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene  an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor  the two boys hanging out together in public  a convenient love interest to cause friction  etc . etc  cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers . the ending was strictly  by the numbers  and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie . using the now  cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film  and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment  the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so  called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it  s conclusion . a somewhat promising concept  but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way .  out of  .  

=======================================================================================================

156 ===> this isn  t exactly a great film  but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . the film  s main theme is fate and small  seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors  though instead of focusing on one random event  seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . plus  an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene   like he  s some sort of omnipotent being but there  s absolutely no explanation of him in the film  like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy  .  br    br   the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou . this is capitalize on her success in amelie  though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . the pace is brisk  the acting fine and the conclusion isn  t bad at all . the only reason i didn  t score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots .  

=======================================================================================================

157 ===> except for acknowledging some nice cinematography  i can hardly say anything positive about this movie . the single real issue is the protagonist  s dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life . abundant  emotionally powerful  scenes do not go with this plot and  because of bad acting  they also fail to create the intended atmosphere . the director only manages to introduce anthony  s dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution . the characters do not seem to evolve  although it is difficult to speak of any characters . . . perhaps except for sonny . beside him  actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to  they come off as self  indulging amateurs . i wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script  throwing away all the potential of the plot  or the bad acting  disturbing any appeal that might be left .  

=======================================================================================================

158 ===> this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular  amelie   both having the wonderful audrey tautou playing the central role . laurent firode  the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory .  br    br   the film deals with chance  as its english title indicates . the french title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly  as well as hurricanes in the pacific  something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects . from the start  the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other  something that is hard to imagine  but in the film  s context seems to work well .  br    br   a chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film . irene  who is going to work  is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper . irene  it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day . after irene leaves the train  the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene . it seems they are destined to one another from the start  but alas  they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film .  br    br   audrey tautou is wonderful as irene . faudel  who plays younes  doesn  t have a lot to do until the end  but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part . the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film  which is as light as butterfly wings .  br    br   we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected .  

=======================================================================================================

159 ===> dick foran and peggy moran  who were so good together in the mummy  s hand  return for this very minor universal horror offering . but this time  instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick  babe   we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named  stuff  . but the results are nowhere near as charming  and the scare level is virtually nil .  br    br   dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle . peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride . but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as  the phantom  who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself .  br    br   this  phantom  is not very mysterious  and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness . it  s always nice to see perky moran  but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universal  s instantly forgettable misfires .  

=======================================================================================================

160 ===> the mystery here is why this delightful  small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves . simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti .  br    br   lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations  its rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and  unlike some of its more critically acclaimed competition in the genre  such as the taste of others  it actually entertains .  

=======================================================================================================

161 ===> a badly  acted two  character comedy  drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren  t  we  awful  to  the  indians polemic  with lousy special effects  exploitative use of nudity  and ugly violence . it  s as sincere as a politician  s handshake  as obvious as a car salesman  s pitch  one of the worst movies in the history of the universe . absolute and utter dreck .

163 ===> the movie started off strong  ll cool j  deed  as an undercover police officer  with partner sgt . lazerov  dylan mcdermott from the practice  possibly miscast as a bad guy   committing robbery and murder . deed refuses to kill the drug dealer  which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience . the other big names  freeman  spacey et al  are well cast and the movie shows promise .  br    br   the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake  pollack  is introduced . given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly  or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake  i would choose the former . even talented actors have to work hard at their craft timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him . i would have thought he would put on a better show  given the fact that he has been acting talented for years . everything he did in this film was unconvincing .  br    br   just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums  it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films . even hardcore n  sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent .  br    br   that aside there are a few plot holes  such as pollack  s sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery . this movie had so much promise . thoroughly disappointing .

164 ===> faith and mortality . . . viewed through the lens of an elderly ashkenazi jewish  american gentleman and a younger  african  american jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years . .  br    br   mostel  s character is a tailor with chronic back problems  and a terminally ill wife belafonte  s character is a career hustler  never settling on a regular job  and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd purgatory   he must convince mostel to renew his faith  as it has been failing along with his wife  s health  and his own  . . but belafonte  s levine has his own problems  still pining for the girlfriend he left behind . .  br    br   belafonte  s character leaves the film before he seemingly should  and so the the ending is cryptic  and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending . .  br    br   this is not a  typical  hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person  s crisis of faith . . it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors . .  

=======================================================================================================

165 ===> other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong howe in the battle scenes  this film is a true stinker .  br    br   this is the second film that i  ve seen in recent days directed by alexander korda . the first was charles laughton  s  rembrandt .  it was so lousy that i shut it off . this one i  m afraid is not very much better .  br    br   flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth . perhaps  her performance as the virgin queen was good for     standards but when you compare it to that of a helen mirren  it is absolutely no match . in robotic fashion  robson states her lines . her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spirit .  br    br   even a dashing laurence olivier can  t save this utter piece of boredom .  br    br   future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn  t really convey anything here . to think  that scarlett was  years later   br    br   it  s a shame that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film .  

=======================================================================================================

166 ===>  . . . and i do mean it . if not literally  after all  i have not seen every movie ever created    at least  obviously  among the ones  the many i know .  br    br    .     the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly  for example  the piece of kannes  kompetition  krowned  korean  kraap called  oldboy   can be truly bad . but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under  . this movie  very much worth watching  is . a disgrace .  br    br   true  i give it a   in protest . the movie is not perfect . its true rating should be an  or a  . it has some acting flaws  belafonte especially   the script wanders around  sometimes . however  what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times  the czech jan kadar  directing two of the greatest actors of all time  the beloved  larger  than  life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting  poetic  moral tour de force . a pair made in heaven  it  s true that this movie  little flaws apart  does not pander to the average audiences  but those interested in watching an excellent  while  again  not beyond criticism  movie of the incomparable director who gave us  the shop on the main street   the best movie ever about holocaust  should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that  american beauty  is better than  the angel levine  .  br    br   it isn  t .  

=======================================================================================================

167 ===> now i  ll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair  so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie .  br    br   that about sums it up too . i disliked this movie . to be more specific  i disliked the concept of this movie . the cinematography was good . the mood was nice . and the acting was satisfactory .  br    br   however  the story is fatuous  unacurate and misleading . it is also offensive .  br    br   i am a quarter cree indian  and for some reason i feel insulted  on a personal level  by the nature of whitaker  s character . first of all  he  s a black guy . and this isn  t a racist remark  i swear . the thought of a white  hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents . the katana represents the soul of a samurai  imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai . for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside  and where the heck did he get a katana anyway  it must be one of those replicas  which insults the samurai caste even more .  br    br   also  ghost dog showed no honor . near the end of the movie  he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain . not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy  it  s more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists  but hates none  the  less .  br    br   then he tries to kill his boss  when he finds out his boss is a baddie . you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable  he kills himself  to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master .  br    br   everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to bushido .  br    br   so  we have great cinematography  good ambiance and so  so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise   which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it   making it an unsatisfactory overall film  and an insult to everything a honorable bushi  samurai  holds dear .  br    br    .     bleah

168 ===> most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm . not so this gloriously bent  batty and berserk over  the  top italian  made shot  in  canada kitsch gut  buster it  s a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over  baked  what the hell  s going on   crackpot excess and inanity .  br    br   a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a    foot yeti that resembles a hirsute    s disco stud  complete with jumbo wavy afro  perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice . they dethaw the beast  jolt him back to life with electric charges  grossly mistreat him  and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth . before you can say  hey  the filmmakers are obviously ripping off  king kong    our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage  grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen  the gorgeous pheonix grant  he lays lustful eyes on  and storms away with his new lady love . the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience . of course  he breaks free again  nabs the vixen  and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage .  br    br   the sublimely stupid dialogue  sample line  philosophy has no place in science  professor    cheesy  far from  special effects  the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw  dropping awfulness   clunky  mis  direction  and a heavy  handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere  is the yeti a man or a beast   ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen . better still  we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti  s nipples  which causes it to harden and elicits a big  leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth     the vixen nurses the yeti  s wounded hand while he makes goo  goo eyes at her  the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building  and the furry fellow even breaks a man  s neck with his toes     . overall  this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should  be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that  s eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following .

169 ===> to be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it  but i  m never one to let others influence my viewings  in fact i  m more likely to watch something out of defiance  . bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway  the fact that rhonda fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away . the picture isn  t very good  and is in fact very morally dubious  all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form  all motivated by greed or egocentric victories  this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture . sadly it doesn  t  and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can  t help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film  nobody in the cast come out with any credit  with lead man guy madison painfully wooden in the extreme .  br    br   not even the lovely rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone       

=======================================================================================================

170 ===> stargate is the best show ever . all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles . i love the connection between the characters . if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it . although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can  t be because it is completely different . i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks . unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season   is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time  which is highly depressing  . however this program is very very good and is a must see  but be warned it is highly addictive . so in summery i love stargate  and amanda tapping  .

171 ===> happened upon a copy of this . not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i  d be finding those responsible and demanding it back  all i can say is this would be a terrible student film . any understanding of the medium of film is absent . acting is god awful  the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame  and the change in tone of the lead character  s reaction to the  ghost  is laughable .  br    br   i can only agree that the  glowing  reviews of this film are from friends and family . i  m afraid it  s not even entertainingly bad .  br    br   amateur in the extreme   br    br   avoid  avoid  avoid

172 ===> having seen most of ringo lam  s films  i can say that this is his best film to date  and the most unusual . it  s a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick  ass martial arts  where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters . the action is fantastic  the story is tense and entertaining  and the set design is truely memorable . sadly  burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next  to  impossible to get your mitts on  even if you near the second biggest china  town in north america  like i do  . if you can find it  don  t pass it up .

173 ===> when thinking about captivity many words come to mind . among them are uninteresting  unentertaining  unsuspensful  unsexy  unfathomable  and unwatchable .  br    br   i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics . they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing  but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they  re aimed at feel like they  re hardcore and hip .  br    br   this movie is a load of boring crap  what the hell has happened to larry cohen  his name hasn  t been attached to anything good since      even so  i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad  was anyone surprised when the movie  s love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths  did anyone not know it when they first saw him  only someone who has never before in his or her life  ever seen another movie   

=======================================================================================================

174 ===> an unusual film from ringo lam and one that  s strangely under  appreciated . the mix of fantasy kung  fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes . a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse . several horses get chopped up . it  s very unexpected .  br    br   the story is very simple  fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple . the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood .  br    br   the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak . blood is everywhere . the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time . sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it  s never bad enough to ruin the film .  br    br   find this one  it  s one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties . just remember it  s not child friendly .  

=======================================================================================================

175 ===> absolutely fantastic .  br    br   now  before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latts  allow me to elaborate . much as i enjoyed it  this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i  ve seen at the cinema  an impressive claim  as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen  . the two leads  daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert  were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst . of course  they weren  t helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne  celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence . the plot  to stretch the term slightly  was thin to non  existent and the  gore  scenes  whilst undoubtedly brutal  were irrelevant and laughably formulaic . what plot there is revolves around a twenty  something model  cuthbert  who is abducted  imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures  both psychological and physical . the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience . whilst there really are very  very few positives to draw from this film  its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film . i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema . within twenty minutes  the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout . for my part i came out flushed with laughter  buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film  making . whichever way you look at it  this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film .  br    br   p . s . i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free . . . so i can afford to laugh about it . i was still tempted to ask for my money back . . . it really was that bad .  

=======================================================================================================

176 ===> people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie  and this movie is no exception . some movies i love did poorly at the box office but  i  m glad to say  this movie isn  t one of them  over nine million dollars  which i don  t think was bad for back then  . the characters were fun  the animation was clear and not fuzzy  and the music was modern  too  which is unusual for an animated movie . i didn  t think professor screw eyes or his  scary cirus  was too scary for little kids  the targeted audience for this movie   but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids  movie . overall  this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years .  

=======================================================================================================

177 ===> jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value . completely lacking in eroticism  excitement  or leading ladies with appeal . one decent fight  a few moments of mild suspense . and a one  note plot .  br    br   the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between law  s character and a dogged homicide detective  well played by timothy spall . but despite their best efforts  both actors are staked to the cross of the film  s banality .  br    br   with a lesser actor in the lead role   and without the benefit of oliver curtis  s cinematography   crocodiles would blend into the sea of low  budget vampire quickies .

178 ===> genre dinosaur  animation  new york  time travel  circus .   br    br   main characters rex the tyrannosaurus rex  elsa the pterodactyl  dweeb the parasarolophus  ooo the triceratops  a boy called louis  a girl called cecilia and captain new  eyes .  actors john goodman  rex   yeardley smith  cecilia   martin short  stubbs the clown   felicity kendal  elsa  etc .   br    br   what happens four dinosaurs  see above  are fed some  brain grain cereal  and are now cuddly  friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children . they go into new york  with big plans  br    br   my thoughts this is a cute animated film . the animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not  so  good  but they look pleasant all the same that way . i like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly  they are nice  friendly and good . i like  almost  all the characters featured  especially elsa and cecilia  but of course i like the others as well . overall  i like this film a lot      br    br   recommended to people who like good children  s animated films  people who like dinosaurs  john goodman and people who think that circuses aren  t always what they seem enjoy

179 ===> this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness .  br    br   i don  t even have the vocabulary to say how dire  turgid  boring  confusing  and just plain strange this effort is  hey what d  ya know i do . . . .  set in a post  apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue  it was all so incomprehensible i couldn  t make head or tail of any of it .  br    br   seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me it really is awful .  br    br   and not in a its so bad it  s good cult way .  br    br   it is just awful  awful  awful  awful .  br    br   honestly . if you still don  t believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think . even gerbils on acid couldn  t hope to understand this .  br    br   avoid or even better destroy . . .

180 ===> its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn  t copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids  if they like dinosaurs that is  i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a  but right now is a little late for that yay  more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don  t want it to be spoiled don  t read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any

181 ===> i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word  there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j . fox    we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and     bills    if i ever let anybody use a room for some  afternoon delight  time i  d be fired on the spot  the organization to which i belong  les clefs d  or  has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously .   similarly untrue was the concept  at the end of the movie  of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee  we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them . there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization .  br    br   this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary . in short it does a disservice to our organization . i welcome any comments .  

=======================================================================================================

182 ===> this movie has to be my favorite of all time . its not supposed to have a plot  because its makers wanted people  charlie sheen  i think  to believe it was a real snuff film . this was an exercise in visual effects  and doesn  t cut away when the action happens like every other film does . movies these days are now all about sound effects  leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood . there still are movie makers who still can  t get fake blood to look like the real thing . there is no rape scene because that wasn  t the point of making the film . have you seen the hills have eyes   the rape scene was funny instead of shocking . although i  m sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror . but since they probably suck at making films  they probably wouldn  t be able to pull it off . the movie  baise moi  has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks .  br    br   its too bad that a movie can  t be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all  especially when talking about an ao or nc    rating . i  m sure eli roth has the ability  talent to make his hostel film series much much better  but he has too tame it down to get an r rating . . . or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations .  br    br   watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage  accident  crime scenes  footage  . don  t forget that this movie was made in     . the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film . that would be like someone saying the  bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps  has better graphics .  

=======================================================================================================

183 ===> this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen  its horrible . christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it  the only the good part is the opening scene .  br    br   don  t be fooled by the title .  end of the world  is truly a bad movie  i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad  only for die hard b  movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit .

184 ===> this is the first out of the guinea pig series  and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection .  br    br   it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films . i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date . so i popped this sucker in and sat down .  br    br   from what i had read on the internet  and realizing the content involved in this film  i was expecting to test my nerves in full force . this ended up not being the case .  br    br   the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point  and how long a human can tolerate pain .  br    br   sounds like one sick flick right  wrong . the film fails to shock . this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror  but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease .  br    br   on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen . though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence . including the ripping out of fingernails  intestines thrown at an unconscious woman  and a needle through the eye .  br    br   overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it  but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one .  

=======================================================================================================

185 ===> i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations . the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good  right  how wrong i was .  br    br   i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey  a director  writer of wiseguy making his feature debut  blah  . . . well the director  writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man  because i cannot see how he  along with the other actors in the film  would ever agree to be in this disaster .  br    br   this movie is absolutely appalling  it  s a mixture of every cop hard boiled clich ever . there is nothing new with edison . the acting was bad and the direction was even worse . it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy . this was the best casted direct to video movie i  ve ever seen .  br    br   some examples of just bad silly moments in edison . . . morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music . . . justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles . . . llcoolj driving a vintage firebird . . .  guys being shot in the head . . .  br    br   this movie is the opposite of good .  br    br   stay away from edison   

=======================================================================================================

186 ===> i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie . . . i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best .  br    br   even though ive seen the  making of   i still have doubts when watching those   mins of pure torture  its that powerful .  br    br   a   out of   because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do  be the best fake snuff film ever made .

187 ===>   a scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters  occurring across the globe . hoping to discover the source of these signals and who  s behind them  the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals . what the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be   according to the dvd sleeve  s synopsis .  br    br   kirk scott  as andrew boran  is the scientist who intercepts alien messages on his computer . he suspects a series of  large earth disruptions  may be connected to the weird space static . mr . scott and pretty blonde wife sue lyon  as sylvia boran  investigate the mysterious signals from outer space . they discover priestly  but creepy christopher lee  as  father pergado    and other silliness . given that   end of the world  is remarkably dull .  br    br    end of the world       john hayes  kirk scott  sue lyon  christopher lee  

=======================================================================================================

188 ===> i have seen the short movie a few years ago . after that i watch all sequels . the first one is really not the best  but it  s the most popular one . i  ve already watch the making of guinea pig  . it  s really great what these guys did . also the sequels are excellent in the special effects . take your chance to watch it   

=======================================================================================================

189 ===> it  s got christopher lee  it  s got huge banks of     s computers that make teletype noises as letters appear on the screen  it  s got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises  it  s got volcanoes  evil aliens disguised as nuns  tidal waves  earthquakes  exploding cars  exploding coffee machines  and as a climax the entire planet blows up . how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly  mind  numbingly dull  the answer  my friend is because    of this movie is made up of establishing shots  most of them involving long tracks  pans  or zooms in combinations  or occasionally all three  that do nothing except give the crew something to do . there are endless shots of our protagonists driving  getting in and out of cars  driving again  walking around looking at stuff  getting in cars and driving . . . i just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering  say something  please somebody  just say something . . . do something . . . anything  . . .   br    br   the dialogue  when it does come  is terrible .  br    br    maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours .  was a typically meaningless line . the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage  justified in this speech from lee as the head alien  br    br    the planet earth has emitted an over  abundance of diseases  they are contaminating the universe . all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed    br    br   this is is neanderthal sf script writing . this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of      s japanese monster suit movies aimed at  year olds . it is  and i collect such things  the most god  awful line from an english language sf movie since buster crabbe retired . it beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encounters .  br    br   lee  who always struck me as a smart  useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits  delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek . i don  t blame him .  

=======================================================================================================

190 ===> what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said  well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks . how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know . im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was . however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real . and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me .  

=======================================================================================================

191 ===> the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns . christopher lee  who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved  is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine . the cast are not too bad  though most have now retired from acting . the film has terrible sound effects  mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems  and it ridiculously pondering at times  showing a scene of the sky  for instance  for what feels like hours at a time . despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world  is  doomed sort of way and the production is adequate . interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie meda band writer frank ray perilli and charles band  s assistant bennah burton . despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it .  

=======================================================================================================

192 ===> my rating refers to the first  seasons of stargate sg   which are wonderfully fresh  creative and addicting . when the cast stepped through the gate  you never knew what lay on the other side  starting around season   the show took a different focus  still good  but different .  br    br   the series follows the adventures of a team of humans  and one alien  who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the  stargate  . the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie  stargate  in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt .  br    br   the episodes are light  innocent and easy to watch  and very creative . many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci  fi movies of their own . what happens next was always unpredictable .  br    br   the characters on which the show rests are also well  defined and brilliantly performed . their tone is serious  but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor . they are simply fun to watch .  br    br   starting somewhere around season   the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe  the goa  uld  then the ori  . the plots become more complex  a lot more political  strategic oriented  and interdependent . the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature .  br    br   one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the    th and    th episodes . they are simply can  t  miss shows . they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through   seasons .  br    br   if you are a sci  fi fan  watch a few episodes of the first  seasons and you  ll likely be hooked . if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides  you have   seasons of shows to look forward to .  

=======================================================================================================

193 ===> this movie was terrible  i rented it not knowing what to expect . i watched the  st  minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb . the acting was bad and there was no plot . the monster is soooooo fake . it growls and its mouth doesnt move . also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster . just plain bad don  t even waste your time .   out of     

=======================================================================================================

194 ===> just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion . every line  every phrase  every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con  man  so well cast .   out of     

=======================================================================================================

195 ===> yes  the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro . it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature  stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond . add in harry andrews  with a strange accent  no less  chasing an ostrich  tons of stock footage of wildlife  and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard  and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal .  

=======================================================================================================

196 ===> unique movie about confused woman  lindsay crouse  who gets involved with sharp con men . joe mantegna gives an oscar  caliber performance as the slickest of the group . absolutely enchanting first hour  as mantegna shows crouse  the ropes  of his con games . story line unravels a bit later on  but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world . definitely worth a shot .  

=======================================================================================================

197 ===>   st watched             out of    dir  jon keeyes   over  the  top rehash of    s supposed horror flicks like friday the   th  versions  thru whatever  . i can  t think of much redeeming here except  or can i think of anything   the story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an  homage  to this  supposedly . but  lo and behold  one of the stupid people  have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered  again  how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this  . guess what  the murderer is at it again and we  re tipped off from the very beginning who it is  so there goes any mystery whatsoever  . and besides all this  where are the  cops  and why doesn  t someone call them . i can  t believe this movie was financed by someone and made . you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher  at least in their movie  going experience  but not so by this filmmaker .  

=======================================================================================================

198 ===> this typical mamet film delivers a quiet  evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man  joe mantegna  good . explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist  lindsay crouse   it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences . the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamet  s films  steven goldstein  jack wallace  ricky jay  andy potok  allen soule  william h . macy   and they do their usual good job . i loved lindsay crouse in this film  and have often wondered why she didn  t become a more noted player than she has become . perhaps i  m not looking in the right places   br    br   the movie proceeds at a slow pace  with flat dialog  yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang  up ending . you  d expect a real let down at the ending  but i found it uplifting and satisfying . i love this movie   

=======================================================================================================

199 ===> this movie is outrageous . by outrageous  i mean awful . i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke . the acting got progressively worse as the  movie  advanced  and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached . when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem . that was not intelligent . truthfully  stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed . if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie  bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends .  

=======================================================================================================

200 ===> a film destined to be on late  night tv long after the present instant  money  makers  have long been forgotten . perhaps a little too subtle for today  s youngsters  but in time they  ll grow into an appreciation of this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

201 ===> this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen . the acting was terrible  horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot  i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone . what a waste of time  first  as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into . all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie . the prank phone calls  halloween night  a psycho  and one knife  its absolutely ridiculous . i was not scared at all during the movie  which i thought horror movies were supposed to do . as for the making of the movie  its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary . i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of  scary movie  for example . at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie .  

=======================================================================================================

202 ===> i  m a big fan of films where people get conned  and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the  films where people get conned  genre . in short  it  s an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels  and never truly revealing what  s happening  while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you  ve just seen . the film cons the audience on many occasions  and despite us knowing this it  s still difficult to guess where it  s going  and every twist comes off as a surprise . as mentioned  i  m a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler . she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient  and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con .  br    br   house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout  and david mamet does well in establishing his film  s setting in the underground levels of the city . the film is well acted also  with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill . joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film  and although his performance is a little under wrought  he  s always solid and believable as the villain of the piece . lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work  and again is believable in her role . she may not be the greatest looker  but at least she can act . the way that the film executes it  s plot is the main star of the show  however  and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer . at times it  s almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film . another thing that  s great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons  which is useful if you  re interested in making twenty bucks  say . all in all  house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride .

203 ===> in texas  seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party . meanwhile  they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears . a serial killer  who is listening to their confessions  makes their nightmares come true  killing each one of them in a sadistic way .  american nightmare  is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation  a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area  as if it were friday    th . then  the story shifts to a bar  where seven friends are celebrating halloween . from this moment on  the story has a great potential  and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance  showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies  as usual in this type of c production . however  the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan  giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting . with a better beginning and conclusion  this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie . my vote is four .  br    br   title  brazil    agonia    agony

204 ===> opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama . all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener  and the performer  intrigued and entertained applies to this film . there isn  t a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad . mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor . if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended  as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited .

205 ===> i feel totally ripped off . someone needs to refund the   .   i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess . this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening . what i don  t get is why did this get distributed in the first place    . . . somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made . i  ve seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact . the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view . . . shot on dv    nuff said . the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section . want to see a good musical  then don  t rent this movie .

206 ===> wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it  s hopeless to help her patients . a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better . here she gets involved with joe mantegna . to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and  house of games  may very well be the best con movie i  ve seen . david mamet wrote and directed this gem that  s full of snappy dialogue  great one  liners  and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end . crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con  man . and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie  the film is in utter control of it  s audience and we are loving the con .  br    br    out of

207 ===> normally  i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest .  br    br   you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet . . . well  this movie was just terrible . it is nigh on impossible to  suspend disbelief   i tried  really  i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn  t let me .  br    br   timberlake should stick to music  what a dreadful performance  no presence as an actor  no character . can  t blame everything on justin the movie also boast a dreadful plot  badly timed editing its definitely an  f  .  br    br   after seeing this  i have to wonder what really motivates actors . i mean  surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part . did he not see how poor it was  what then could motivate him to take the part  money  of course  acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work .  br    br   ll cool j is a great actor he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script .  br    br   meanwhile  the audience goes  what the hell is going on here  you expect me to believe this crap    br    br   in short  apart from justin a great lineup badly executed  very disappointing .

208 ===> here  s my first david mamet directed film . fitting  since it was his first  as well .  br    br   the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie  from the little cons to the big cons to the all  encompassing con . it  s like  the grifters   but without that film  s level of acting .  in that film  john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character .  the acting here is very flat  i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis  . at least in the beginning . it never gets really good  but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes . early in the film  some of lindsay crouse  s lines   the way she reads them   sound as if they  re inner monologue or narration  which they aren  t . with the arrival of mantegna things pick up .  br    br   the dialogue here isn  t as fun as it should be . i was expecting crackerjack ring  a  ding  ding lines that roll off the tongue  but these ones don  t . it all sounds very read  rather than spoken . maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up  but if not  then maybe he should let others direct his words . he  s far too precious with them here and as a result  they lose their rhythmic  jazzy quality . what  s more strange is that other than this  the film doesn  t look or feel like a play . the camera is very cinematic . my only problem with  glengarry glen ross  was that it looked too much like filmed theatre  but in that film the actors were not only accomplished  but relaxed and free . everything flowed .  br    br   i wouldn  t mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines   or even play characters speaking play lines   but here it sounds like movie  or even book  characters speaking play lines . it  s a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn  t work . that doesn  t mean the movie is bad   it isn  t  it  s often extremely entertaining . the best chunk is in the middle .  br    br   it  s standard con movie stuff the new guy  in this case  girl  margaret ford  lindsay crouse  gets involved in the seedy con underworld . how she gets involved is she  s a psychiatrist and one of her patients  billy is a compulsive gambler . she wants to help him out with his gambling debt  so she walks into the house of games  a dingy game room where con men work in a back room . i  ll admit the setup is pretty improbable .  were they just expecting crouse to come in  were they expecting she  d write a cheque  was billy in on it  one of these questions is definitely answered by the end  however .   br    br   and from here the cons are start to roll out . i found the beginning ones   the little learner ones   to be the most fun . we  re getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is .  br    br   we see the ending coming  and then we didn  t see the second ending coming  and then the real ending i didn  t see coming but maybe you did . the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling .  br    br   i  m going to forgive the annoying opening  the improbable bits and the strange line  reading because there are many good things here . if the first part of the movie seems stagy  stick with it . after the half  hour mark it does really get a momentum going . if you want a fun con movie  then here she is . if you want mamet  go watch  glengarry glen ross  again   james foley did him better .  br    br     

=======================================================================================================

209 ===> i wasn  t expecting this to be a great movie  but neither was i expecting it to be so awful . i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel . i turned it back  hoping it was just one part of the movie  but no . and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed  or almost done out of a job  or driven to madness inside her own home  are you kidding me  i was raised to respect  and even fear  my mother but i  d put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house . i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother  s house  after all .  br    br   i didn  t buy any of it . i tried giving it several chances  i really did . sorry .

210 ===> the united states of kiss my ass   br    br   house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller . it stars lindsay crouse as best  selling psychiatrist  margaret ford  who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide . in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels downtown  to visit the lowlife place  house of games .  br    br   the gambler mike  played excellently by joe mantegna  turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty . he offers crouse  s character a deal  if she is willing to sit with him at a game  a big money game in the backroom  he  ll cancel the patients debts . the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work  gaining the trust of others  and a fascinating relationship begins . what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control  is it the psychiatrist or the con  man or is it the well  known man of great bluffs david mamet .  br    br   in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring  however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings  not the direction . in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads  showy and distracting  but mainly as is the case with much of mamet  s work  it is the dialogue  which grips you and slowly draws you into the film . no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words . everyone bluffs and double bluffs  which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order . this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension . house of games can also be viewed as a class  war  division movie . with lindsay crouse we have the middle  class  well  to  do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite  the working class of america earning a living by honest  crime .  br    br   the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema . and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for  it  s stunning .  br    br   an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings .      

=======================================================================================================

211 ===> although  i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie  this sure as hell wasn  t what i would have had in mind  had anything actually come to mind . once i heard of its existence  all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don  t eat the babies . unfortunately  i could only find a copy under its alternate title  island fury . looking back  i guess i could call it a lose  lose situation . on one hand  i still don  t get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don  t eat the babies  and on the other hand  island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful  pointless  boring  unwatchable piece of garbage . yeah  definitely lose  lose .  br    br   i  m not even sure what genre they  re going for here . just early    s badness  with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non  flashback . first up  two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys  once caught  the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string  around her neck  and somehow  these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere . and this is where things start to get weird  somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island  years earlier  when they were only   . i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is . so  now  we  re in the past  while the girls try to retrace their steps  so these bad guys don  t kill them  although  i wouldn  t have minded if they had . in the flashback  the   year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends  eventually stopping by an island for some air  they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents . any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up  but the flashback was undeniably better than the present  which  still  isn  t saying much .  br    br   for a while there i had forgotten about the original story  at one point  i ithought maybe the director had too  and when the flashback ended  that would be the end  which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half  hour shorter . this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end  and real stuff does happen  but it  s stupid . i guess i didn  t exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured  or anything like that  but i did expect some form of outlandish b  entertainment  mostly just a confusing  inept storyline  unsure of its genre . my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures . if anyone  i would only recommend this one to serious b  movie collectors who must have them all  anyone else interested probably has brain damage . what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don  t eat the babies .      

=======================================================================================================

212 ===> this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for . if you watch t . v .  then you might as well not watch the movie . almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews  except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one . it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny . just don  t go see this movie expecting to be surprised . all in all  if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must  see  otherwise just watch the previews and you  ll be just as satisfied .  

=======================================================================================================

213 ===> first of all i just want to say that i love this show    but this episode . . . this episode makes a mockery of the entire show .  br    br   i don  t know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series .  br    br   there is no story line  everything is chaotic and the jokes . . . . . are crap .  br    br   the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game . . . . . for example  how do the furlings look like  by creating that stupid  previously on . . .  . . . . . . is simply embarrassing .  br    br   its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad .  

=======================================================================================================

214 ===> i have to say  from the beginning  when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn  t blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie  with a lot of potential  though the movie wasn  t as  erm  amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens  which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing  even though i  m not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people  i don  t remember one line from either of those movies  i  m not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts  in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you  ah getting slightly off the point here  well my point is that the that you don  t have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series  which unfortunately ended after   amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end  in     .  br    br   though i didn  t like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in      and let me tell you  the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series  the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects  were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today . i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn  t for stargate  and my dad  who actually got me into sci fi when i was like   and i  m glad he did  other wise i wouldn  t have seen the brilliant shows like sg   which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies  basically if a new sci fi series isn  t better or as good as sg   its not worth watching . basically this is the best sci fi show to date  and if you don  t watch this  then you have no idea what you are missing   

=======================================================================================================

215 ===> i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago . i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again . the excessive amount of watery  blood  at the beginning is just plain obsolete  not to mention the  whip  around  wind sounds . my friends and i made a super low budget movie  and the effects still exceeded this crap fest .  br    br   as for the amount of mistakes in this movie  there are way too many to count . i knew one of the actors  believe it or not  he was my theatre teacher . ha   br    br   final verdict don  t bother with this  horror  flick .  br    br    stars  out of a possible     

=======================================================================================================

216 ===> let me start out by saying i  m a big carrey fan . although i  ll admit i haven  t seen all of his movies coughthe magesticcough . bruce almighty was enjoyable . none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end  i dont know what the writers were thinking . somehow i couldn  t help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re  creating liar liar .  br    br   on a positive note  the daily show  s steve correl is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast . see bruce almighty if you  re a big jim carrey fan  or if you just want to see a light  hearted  que soft piano music  somewhat funny comedy .  

=======================================================================================================

217 ===> my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions  and mostly artsy films that require thought . i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom . my wife has double the attention span that i do . all that being said   this film is just plain empty and boring  it went nowhere . never blossomed . it started fairly strong with a promising plot . . . then she bakes cookies . . . goes to spain . . . . she sulks  she stares . . . . the credits roll . uneven  full of holes  false starts  dead ends . we ff  d through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space . artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried . zzzz . . . . . . it  s like a beautifully shot chick  flick that  s pretending to be deep or artsy . you never get to know nor understand morvern at all . about halfway through you just don  t care anymore . we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop . don  t waste your time on this . i  m shocked it scores so high .  

=======================================================================================================

218 ===> ok  so it  s not a masterpiece like the godfather  but it doesn  t have to be . the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times . if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times  it has accomplished its purpose . i laughed out loud and left with a smile . i feel like i got my money  s worth .  

=======================================================================================================

219 ===> it was probably just my dvd    but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd .  br    br   i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level  in order to hear about   percent of the dialog . some of the talking still remained sub  audible . if you  re from scotland  you might have a chance  albeit a slim one .  br    br   peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds  including unwrapping a package  footsteps  even puffing on a cigarette .  br    br   with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard  i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment  such as a disco . and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down .  br    br   there is art and there is art  even in the field of audio mixing . but this effort  in a time of war  would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity .  br    br   after about a half hour  i gave up  having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture  either .  

=======================================================================================================

220 ===> i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn  t the goal . his character is like all of us . wanting more  better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver .  br    br   morgan freeman made a great god . with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself .  br    br   i thought jennifer aniston  s character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry  s basically self  centered tv anchorman wanna  be but that  s the way it was written .  br    br   i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened .  br    br   i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep . this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart .  br    br   a funny film .  

=======================================================================================================

221 ===> i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen  besides the dead body in the first scenes . . . and her disposal of him . i was wrong . it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven . i really don  t care what young lassies from scotland do these days  who thy screw  what drugs they take . visually  the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me . the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend . as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts . . .  . that  s all there is   . now i see why her boyfriend killed himself . rename it .  bare bitch boredom  or what i did on my trip to spain .  i  m such a sucker for sticking these things out .  

=======================================================================================================

222 ===> i first heard about this film about   years ago when i was a kid in grade school     it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day  and under the entry for movies  or cinema  i don  t remember   were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental  and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon . it really intrigued me  since it stood out the most on the page  it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it  .  br    br   about   or so years later  the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole   dvd set of  treasures of american film archives  released by the national film preservation foundation . so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set  i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs . after all these years  i could finally see the film  after viewing it  it slightly wasn  t was i was expecting it to be  it tended to be a more organic  looking film  not that that  s a bad thing  but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic   but it was still an impressive film  imho  considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film  including hand  tinting the film itself  and using video equipment for some of the film  s scenes  filmed off of a video monitor   giving it a more distressed  lo  res look .  br    br   don  t get me wrong  the techniques used in this film were quite ground  breaking for     . that  s why it  s still one of my favorite short  experimental films  and a creative inspiration for me as well . . .  

=======================================================================================================

223 ===> i  m a fan of arty movies  but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel . agonisingly slow to develop a non  existent plot based on a promising premise  the experience is  shall we say  trying . even after bad movies i feel that i learn something  or enjoyed some aspect  but there there was nothing to appreciate . the premise was not uninteresting  but the movie starts and ends there . the acting was ok  though the characters were utterly boring . for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal  she is mightily empty . pity . i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic  but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content .  

=======================================================================================================

224 ===> this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made . carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film . he was both funny and sad . carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan . nolan blames god  morgan freeman  for everything that goes wrong in his life . then  god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers . as i said before  carrey did an excellent job . i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor  actress . the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point . this movie can be funny  bruce  s dog  as well as sad  the  break  up   . the script worked well  too . i am glad they made a sequel to this film . i rate this film a     .  

=======================================================================================================

225 ===> comments contain spoilers i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene  when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case  when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant  but we weren  t to notice  and when colby was a fg triple agent . but now  in tonight  s episode  david is trapped with a paranoid  nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun  in an elevator and . . . . he can  t disarm him . a trained  experienced field agent who has been  st through the door many times and is experienced in hand  to  hand fighting  can  t take out a nut job . not when said nut job blinks  looks away  drops his head  closes his eyes not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for   seconds .  br    br   then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby  frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick  love interest amita  my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged . don gives david the  distress word  that is the code for  the st is about to go down   david is ready  they kill the lights  drop the elevator  startle the nut job and . . . . . .  br    br   david cannot disarm  kill  beat into submission the nut job . the bad guy ends up with both guns  david ends up shot .  br    br   i  m done . hope the numb  rs are fun .  

=======================================================================================================

226 ===> if you want a serious laugh pain  watch this movie  and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster . the deleted scenes are priceless . i don  t know why they didn  t include them in the original movie . it can  t be because of time  since the movie is only    minutes long . morgan freeman is a brilliant actor  who has been overlooked for too long . jim carrey needs meds   

=======================================================================================================

227 ===> after watching a dozen episodes  i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling . in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models  i thought that my profession was being joked about . i am not a mathematician  instead a chemical engineer  but i do work a lot with mathematical models . so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to  make  believe  of fairy tales .  br    br   first  choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task . charlie eppes is shown as a genius  but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model  specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future . individuals are erratic and haphazard  there is no modeling for them . isaac asimov even wrote about that in the      s . even if there were a model for specific kind of individual  it would be a probabilistic  stoichastic  one  meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction .  br    br   second  supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found  the model parameters have to be known . these parameters are the constants of the equations  such as the gravity acceleration   .  m  s    and often are not easy to determine . again  charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses . and after the model and the parameters are chosen  they would have to be tested . oddly  they are not  and by miracle  they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted .  br    br   third  a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected  not only by numbers  but also by sci  fi movies the computational effort required for solving these models . try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job . even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models  he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow . and even with the right software  hardware combination  the model solution might well take days to be reached . he solves them immediately  i could use his computer in my research work  i would be very glad .  br    br   as a drama  it is far from being the best show . the characters are somewhat stereotyped  but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are . the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent .  br    br   for some layman  the show might work . for others  the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow   

=======================================================================================================

228 ===> well  was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns  this film sure was better than that bore   oh  god  . i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through . carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe  and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance . i  for one  don  t consider her to be either ugly or untalented . i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history . see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one . well written and even better played out  this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman  s best .

229 ===>   cia codenamealexa  is an absolute horrible rip off of luc besson  s classic film  la femme nikita        . the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them .  pretty much the same story structure of la femme nikita  the acting combo of lorenzo lamas and o . j . simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history . lamas   acting  is simply a bad steven segal impersonation . watching orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience .  br    br   the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable . there are so many action movie  conventions  in the film it is ridiculous unnecessary car explosions  people flying thru glass windows  terrorists  bad ponytails  etc . the musical score resembles david michael frank  s score for  hard to kill         which furthers the steven segal theme of this movie . there is plenty of martial arts in the film  and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production . the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up  and i have to admit i was mildly entertained .  br    br   lorenzo lamas had the look of an action star back in the early    s but he is certainly no action star  that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters . my recommendation is that you skip  cia codenamealexa  and check out  la femme nikita  instead .

230 ===> starring jim carrey  morgan freeman  jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie . i mean  what a conceptual nightmare . jim carrey playing god  nothing is sacred anymore .  br    br   well  this movie is hardly sacred  but it also is not sacrilegious  at least not to any great extent . yes  jim carrey has the powers of god for a while  but he is not god . confused  i  ll give you the low down .  br    br   jim carrey plays bruce nolan  a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life . he lives with his beautiful girlfriend  grace  anniston   and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other  but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground .  br    br   then bruce gets a shot at anchorman  only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter . obviously not please  bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired .  br    br   much complaining and griping about god later  bruce gets a page . after a while he gets tired of it calling  so he responds and goes to the omni presents building  heh  . there he meets god  freeman   who is the boss  electrician  and janitor of the building . i found this highly amusing . god is the boss  the holy spirit is the electrician  and jesus christ is the janitor . think about it . boss  obvious . electrician  the guy who keeps everything running . janitor  the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left . brilliant .  br    br   anyway  bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god  but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god  he starts to believe a bit . wonder why . enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies .  br    br   since this is hollywood  bruce obviously eventually smartens up  learns his lesson  and starts using his powers for the good of the world . in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done  not bruce  s .  br    br   since it is jim carrey  the movie is quite amusing  and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it . the movie is not perfect theology  but for hollywood  it is definitely a good attempt . many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging  and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie .  br    br   so  while far from perfect  definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it .  br    br   bottom line  .  out of   worth a view or two   

=======================================================================================================

231 ===> spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie  lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy  pretty boy act  and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa . oj simpson is a detective  coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona . translation cable tv filler . there isn  t enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure .  br    br   the script has some gaping holes . best  worst moment in one jarring scene  oj  s partner expresses his aversion to the morgue . oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot  or words to that effect . this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released  it is truly appalling  and therefore entertaining in an unintentional  horrible way . i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose . now that  s a guilty pleasure . bc

232 ===> china o  brien       was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states . this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse . sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he  s lost his touch because he  s not that great of a director . the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms . rothrock and richard norton . if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight  to  video action flick .  br    br   china o  brien returns home to help out her dad . he  s having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help . so she returns home and restores order  with the help of two unlikely people  . but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies   br    br   if you  re a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie  s catered for you . i only enjoyed the fighting scenes  everything else is rubbish . why didn  t raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director   br    br   recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

233 ===> as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true  life tale  i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been .  br    br   the bad  i  m a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played  but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator .  br    br   the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage  mouth . from what i read  there were several directors replacing each other on this film  and that  s too bad . you can tell things aren  t right with the story . i couldn  t get  involved  with treat williams  portrayal of cooper  either . he should have been fascinating  but he wasn  t in this movie . it  s also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of  folk hero   but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy  too .  br    br   not everything was disappointing . i can  t complain about the scenery  from the lush  green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona .  br    br   i  d like to see this movie re  made and done better  because it is a one  of  a  kind story .

234 ===> remember these two stories fondly and in the first  set in the not too distant future  we see a young boy preparing for examination day  the state i . q test . the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test . upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why . the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth . the boy then asks  puzzled again  why wouldn  t he  it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry  but their son  s i . q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial . a corker of a concluding scene  a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present . which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present . a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion .  

=======================================================================================================

235 ===> up until this new season i have been a big  little mosque  fan . however  the new season had absolutely ruined it .  br    br   the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show . it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice . the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light .  br    br   i am neither christian or muslim  but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend . not any more .  br    br   just cancel it and be done with it . it  s not worth watching any more .  br    br   it might still be saved  but a lot of change would need to be made .  br    br   bring back the old format .  

=======================================================================================================

236 ===> having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based . upon this point i cannot comment  having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously . however  what i can say with certainty  is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass let  s be honest here  this film is just so much fun   br    br   ok . . so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character  s but let  s put this into a clear perspective . . do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic      s batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character  or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the     film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series   br    br   the point is  yes this film is incredibly camp but that  s precisely its charm   br    br   former tarzan  ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this  and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot   and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles . also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman .  br    br   best scene  far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke  lemonade and milk at a formal occasion  also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen   priceless   br    br   simply put  the film doesn  t take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it . great fun from start to finish   and you  ll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed    

=======================================================================================================

237 ===> this movie is one long chiche after another . first of all  though they did their share  there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot . the wigs and accents are terrible . they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons . john is the nasty  envious  closet homosexual  slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book . they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation  it was always just the two of us   john would not have been mean to his fans like this either . like his death showed us he was too nice if anything . the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul  s yesterday . an insulted john says something along the lines of  sure and while i croon why don  t you get down on your knees  put on your wife  s wig  and lick my liggin  . that made me laugh for days . really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous . john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day  they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here . forget it .  

=======================================================================================================

238 ===> most people miss hollywood  s point of concept . if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child  within the confines of the law then i  approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage .  br    br   in all times of conflict or war  the public and government look for heroes to decorate . the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with  such as doc savage  james bond  superman  batman  spiderman and others . doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the  best of the best  before james bond  superman or any of the others . all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character  not the  man of bronze  .  

=======================================================================================================

239 ===> if you  re looking to be either offended or amused or both  you  ll probably have to look elsewhere . lmotp really isn  t even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichs . at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess .  br    br   beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it  s just another lame  innocuous and anti  septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing . and once the  zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao    hype wears out its welcome  the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it  s so shallow when judged on its merits alone .  br    br   unless you  re obsessed with muslim culture in the west and  or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don  t see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype . other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural  ethnic dichotomy in western multi  ethnic societies . lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight .  

=======================================================================================================

240 ===> outragously entertaining period piece set in the   s  it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series  as much as  raiders of the lost ark   only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson . the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau  predating batman by two decades . starring ron ely  tarzan  as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non  existent latin american country of hidalgo . best line  our hero to mona  holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug  mona  you  re a brick    br    br   paul wexler  s ham  and  cheese blackhat  captain seas is a an absolute delight . expect a little  raiders . .   a dash of  batman   a little  the lost world   a little  lost horizons  and a whole lot of campiness and you  ll get it just right . watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa  s patriotic music . a prime candidate for dvd release  it is certainly overdue . an unmissable treat for the whole family .      

=======================================================================================================

241 ===> this series just gets worse and worse . poorly written and just plain not funny  the premise is excellent  but the writer  s inexperience shines through . by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about  and resorted to that patronizing  smug   oh  silly you  style acting that comes with a no laugh script . they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say  aren  t we zany  isn  t this funny  well  no  it  s not actually . gum disease is less painful . no wonder  with the exception of corner gas  canadians generally avoid canadian tv . come on cbc you  re suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent . pull the plug on this amateurish mess .  

=======================================================================================================

242 ===> given the title  this first follow  up to quartet       obviously reduces the number of w . somerset maugham stories which comprise the film . the author still turns up to introduce the episodes  but there  s no epilogue this time around by the way  while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r . c . sheriff  here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation  as well as noel langley  though it  s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison  . as can be expected  much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment  though this also extends to at least three cast members  namely naunton wayne  wilfrid hyde  white and felix aylmer  the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled the colonel  s lady  . while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor  slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running  time   it  s still done with the utmost care  acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain .  br    br   the verger tells of a church sexton  james hayter   for which the story  s title is another word  who  s dismissed after   years of service by the new parish priest  michael hordern  simply because he  s illiterate . rather than rest on his laurels  despite his age  he not only takes a wife  his landlady  played by kathleen harrison  but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered  and  with business flourishing  this is developed into a whole chain . the last scene  then  sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who  not only is surprised to learn of hayter  s lack of education  but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were  to which the wealthy  and respected  tobacconist replies  with some measure of irony  that he had the calling to be a verger   br    br   the second episode  mr . know  all  is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man  nigel patrick   british despite his foreign  sounding name of kelada  who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun . naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde  white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most  the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick  s attentions to his pretty wife  anne crawford  . during a fancy  dress party  however  the passengers decide to enact their revenge  on kelada by having one of them impersonate him  a jest which he naturally doesn  t appreciate    still  it  s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character  told by crawford that the necklace she  s wearing is an imitation  wayne challenges patrick to name its pricebut the latter realizes immediately that it  s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford  s position if he were to tell  so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer   br    br   as can also be deduced from the title  sanatorium deals with the myriad patients at such a place  run by andre  morell the protagonist is a new intern  roland culver  who wistfully observes the various goings  on . the narrative  in fact  highlights in particular three separate strands of plot  one humorous  the feud  between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium  played by finlay currie and john laurie   one melodramatic  the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long  suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies  and one bittersweet  the romance between nave but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which  in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a lifer  while rennie only has a few years left to him  leads the couple to the altar  .  

=======================================================================================================

243 ===> i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with . but the execution was poor . the script is poor and acting is bad . there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way  like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard . the show can  t be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably . i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent .  br    br   till now second season is worse than the first one . i had my hopes high regarding this show  but i was kind of disappointed . still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers . anyway i wish best of luck for the future .  

=======================================================================================================

244 ===> a message movie  but a rather good one . outstanding cast  top to bottom . interesting in that bette davis  s plot line is essentially back story  the extremely negative reviews  name throwing at the screenplay  playwright  associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about  angles in america   etc . etc .  object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii . gosh  that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me .  br    br   theatrical and movie  making  and acting styles vary over time and of course   years later this particular movie would not be made in this way . yes casablanca is a better movie  i guess   but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them  casablanca is primarily a love story . the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot   more of a thriller . both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors . the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited  

=======================================================================================================

245 ===> wow  here it finally is the action  movie  without action . in a real low  budget setting  don  t miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times  of a future seattle we find a no  brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood .  br    br   there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors  performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies  mainly  matrix  without having the money to do it right . yes  we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot  outs    secs approx .  but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody  s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then .  br    br   and  yes  we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere  as if the script was thought  out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes .  br    br   believe me  it is as bad as it possibly can get . in fact  it doesn  t deserve to be taken seriously  but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money .  

=======================================================================================================

246 ===> wilhelm grimm  alexander knox  stands trial for nazi crimes . three witnesses give evidence  father warecki  henry travers   wilhelm  s brother karl  erik rolf  and wilhelm  s former lover marja  marsha hunt   before wilhelm speaks in his own defense . the film ends after the court sums up . . . .  br    br   the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand . the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna  shirley mills   who wilhelm is accused of raping the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps and the church service where willie grimm  richard crane  denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina  dorothy morris   marja  s daughter  after she has been shot at a brothel .  br    br   throughout the film  knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter  resentful and evil man . martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest . this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished .  

=======================================================================================================

247 ===> what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe . during the first season  dark angel was on my weekly  must see  list  and not just because of jessica alba .  br    br   unfortunately  the powers  that  be over at fox decided that they needed to  fine  tune  the plotline . within  episodes of the season opener  they had totally lost me as a viewer  not even to see jessica alba   . i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish . the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin . on one of the second season episodes  they even had max sleeping and dreaming  where the first season stated she biologically couldn  t sleep .  br    br   the moral of the story  the one that hollywood never gets   if it works  don  t screw with it   br    br   azjazz  

=======================================================================================================

248 ===> the only reason i give this movie an  out of   is because there are few movies  in my opinion  that are perfect . this little b picture is a taut story  well told . i  ve always been intrigued by alexander knox  but have seen him very few movies . here he plays wilhelm grimm  a sad little man who turns into a monster . he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse . the performance is one of the most chilling performances i  ve ever seen . since world war   actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars . i imagine that since this was made during the war  the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil . but knox puts in that kind of performance   a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer . i still can  t get over it .  br    br   marsha hunt  who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly  is cast against type in probably the best performance i  ve ever seen her give  too . maybe not oscar worthy  but the best of her career . nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those  slight  roles she often played . but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama .  br    br   if you like human drama stories  or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis  i highly recommend this fine little film .  

=======================================================================================================

249 ===> i was really disappointed in this movie . those that voted this thing a   have a screw lose . the acting was ok  kinda wooden and cardboard . the ending was sorry . i just didn  t care for this at all .  br    br   no way could i recommend this mess .  

=======================================================================================================

250 ===> norman  is that you  was  this is all third hand  so take it with a grain of salt  adapted to an african american family from a jewish one  when it made the transition off stage and onto screen . also  it was one of those movies originally filmed in video  so the prints from the theater can  t have been that great . still  performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good .  br    br   what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early   s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family . for that reason alone  it  s pretty interesting  if not a little  hollywood  . don  t believe me  check out lines about curtains  etc . very stereotypical . not too deep .  br    br   but . . . the movie really shines in a couple of areas . there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife  who  s run away with his brother    to ensenada in a souped up pinto . the phone conversation across the border is really memorable .  br    br   but . . . the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his  their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs . to the best of my knowledge  this is the only time that routine was filmed . and  it  s a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version  i  m told . still  it  s vintage madame  and shouldn  t be missed . people are still stealing lines from wayland the man was truly gifted . enjoy the movie

251 ===> how did mike hammer live  in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace  nah  he  d knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly  specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house  wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face  that  s how . spillane wrote trash paperbacks  for sure  but how do you make it worse  give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office  add some over  the  hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw  up the story  line by some retard  drugged out screen writer  that  s how   

=======================================================================================================

252 ===> even though this movie came out a year before i was born  it is definetely one of my favorite comedies . it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son  s homosexuality . like most parents  he doesn  t know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like . his son  norman  is now grown up and living on his own . when his father  ben  finds out that his son is gay  he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him . the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie   when ben gets to norman  s apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it  s his son in drag   norman . . . is that you    . the movie had me laughing from start to finish . redd foxx is great . although a lot of the content is stereotypical  i didn  t find anything offensive about the way the material was handled  and it even has a good ending . highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

253 ===> i rented this movie from the library  it  s hard to find for good reason  purely out of curiosity . i  m a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment . the bell jar       is by far one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen . the script is horrible  not because it strays from the original novel text  but because it strays without focus or intent . the scenes are ill  constructed and don  t lead the viewer anywhere . what  s with the hokey voice over of plath  s poetry  lady lazarus has little do with greenwood  s situation plath  s poetry was completely misused . marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood  or any   year old for that matter  partly due to casting  she was   during filming  the age plath was when she died  and partly due to the fact that she can  t act . hassett is all emotion  no craft  no skill . the direction is mediocre the director simply covers what  s there  which isn  t much . the only reason i  m giving the film a  is because  isn  t an option . sorry sylvia  you  ll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting .

254 ===> the  amazing mr . williams  stars melvyn douglas  who did five films in      one of which was ninotchka with garbo . his co  star was joan blondell  maxine   who also did five films that year  three of which they made together  douglas is lt . williams  and he and his co  horts are presented with a dead body  and they must figure out what really happened . viewers will recognize his co  workers  the actors  clarence kolb  donald macbride  don beddoe  always played positions of authority . . . senators  bank presidents  policemen . this who  dunnit has a flair of comedy to it   the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other  and even williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally . some fun gags  williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend . there  s a lot of fun stuff in here  so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on . don  t want to give away any spoilers  so you  ll have to catch it on turner classic movies . director alexander hall made mostly comedies  and was reportedly engaged to lucy at some point .

255 ===> saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm . several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw . first  the adults did not age when the children did for   years . several parts of the film had continuity problems  for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the   years passed .  br    br   the copy i saw was missing about   minutes or so  at least a huge gap with black screen appeared . it is too bad  because even though the script left something to be desired  bergman  russell both did fine in the film in their roles . it is a shame the large chunk is missing  but what is here is watchable .  br    br   i just wish it was all intact . the script makes little sense in that bergman  s character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults  some of the time lines don  t make sense either . there is a stock market crash that resembles     but the kids grow up to fight in world war  . all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine . just wonder what was in the   gap of film i could not see as it was missing .

256 ===> what was there about     that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films  well  whatever it was  the magic may also be found in this columbia picture . it  s a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show .  maltin  s movie book does not contain it .  in nearly every department  amazing mr . williams is a jewel .  br    br   it  s the story of a first  rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended . as the wedding bells are about to ring  he gets called to the scene of a murder . the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force . there are a lot of laughs in the process .  br    br   melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy . joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight . edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious .  br    br   the film goes on a bit too long  but who cares  the screwball comedies are always able to entertain  and this film belongs right in there with the best .

257 ===> i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore roosevelt and his four sons . they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film . warner baxter in his portrayal of adam stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our   th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of tr  s character .  br    br   like tr all of the stoddard sons serve in world war i  in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed .  br    br   but what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things  that  s susan hayward  s job here . in one of her earliest prominent roles  hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son  has an affair with another  and starts making a play for the third . it  s an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to live .  br    br   i suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as theodore roosevelt was and warner baxter portrays  everyone is afraid to tell father what  s going on . the sons and also their governess ingrid bergman . here  s where the plot gets a little silly . bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by baxter and wife fay wray for their kids . wray dies and baxter suffers some financial reversals in business . bergman has to be let go . she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up .  br    br   i  m sorry  but i can  t believe the kids need a governess now . hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn  t the kids who brought her back . in the normal course of things  bergman would have gotten on with her life .  br    br   one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out . possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have .  br    br   it  s too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when hayward was at her heights and bergman had just made a comeback .  br    br   susan hayward is the main reason to see adam had four sons . and i  m willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor .

258 ===> this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all . generally speaking  i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories . and this one is great  besides meryl  s performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise  the movie  s greatest asset is the story it is based on . the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture  after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye  opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans  and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society . it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people  the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example  are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would  for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices  shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions . the other face of the so  called  civilized  society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings  needless to say  this is very general  even though this specific tale unfolds in australia   that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty . must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought  provoking .

259 ===> after the success of scooby  doo  where are you  they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show . but unfortunately  they added a new character that spoilt scooby  doo success forever . they invented a new show with a new title  scooby and scrappy  doo . it was scrappy  doo that made this show a complete failure  probably for both adults and kids together . scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up . scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain  and they were also trying to stop him . scooby  doo doesn  t need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews . if they wanted scooby  doo to be more successful  they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy . this was just poor  maybe your kids will prefer it

260 ===> when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock  australia  lindy chamberlain  meryl streep  sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience . for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press  and the whole thing turns into a circus . lindy doesn  t help matters either because she won  t play to the jury or courtroom  she  s only herself  and she  s a tough nut to crack  so of course everyone thinks she  s guilty because there  s a piece of evidence that hasn  t come to light . sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain  a seventh  day adventist pastor  who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife . it  s good  or bad  to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too  because the australian public doesn  t believe the story and the media only fans the flames . eventually  lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor  but years later  a missing piece of evidence shows up and she  s freed  but not until after the family  s life is basically ruined . a heart  breaking story  very well done  a bit long but well worth seeing .  out of   .

261 ===> i only recently found out that madeleine l  engle  s novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd . the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times .  br    br   despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel  the murry family is well cast  with a likable  if too pretty  meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating .  br    br   the first half hour is promising enough  doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene . unfortunately as soon as the non  human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart . alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit  think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead  and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive  she must have visited faye dunaway  s plastic surgeon in recent years . for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west .  br    br   in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction . i understand that this is a tv movie  but the cgi looked like something that could have been done   years earlier . mrs whatsits  centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast  who in the novel is a velvety  elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here . i could go on and on  nearly every artistic choice is a disaster  presumably because there wasn  t a large enough budget to do this justice  but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement .  br    br   this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films . what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children  s literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and it  s sequels for the big screen  giving it the scope it deserves .

262 ===> a cry in the dark  br    br   a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid  if unremarkable film . this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep  s best actress nomination  the movie received little attention from major awards groups .  br    br   little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama  well  constructed on every level . if you ask me  this is an under  appreciatted classic .  br    br   the film opens rather slowly  letting the audience settle into the chamberlain  s at a relaxed pace and really notice that  at the core  they are an incredibly loving  simple family . fred schepisi  the director  selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy  while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy  streep  and michael  sam neill  chamberlain care for their children .  br    br   while the famous line  a dingo took my baby   has become somewhat of a punchline these days  the movie never even comes close to laughable . the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured . it is subtle and realistic  leaving the audience horrified and asking questions .  br    br   the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain  s continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court  which suspects lindy of murder .  br    br   the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping . as an audience member  i was fully invested in the chamberlain  s plight . . . and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media . but at the same  the media  public opinion is understandable . i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic  but they always had valid reasons to hold their views .  br    br   the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas .  br    br   in terms of performances  the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill . . . and they deliver in every way . for me  this ranks as one of  if not    meryl streep  s best performances . for all her mastery of different accents  which of course are very impressive in their own right   streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters . i find this to be one of streep  s more subtle performances  and she hits it out of the park . and neill  an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park  is a perfect counterpoint to streep  s performance . from what i  ve seen  this is undoubtedly neill  s finest work to date . it  s a shame he wasn  t recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep  s . . . b  c the two of them play of each other brilliantly .  br    br   more emotionally gripping than most films  and also incredibly suspenseful . . . a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations . i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams  the dingo took my baby   watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line .  br    br   . . . a . . .

263 ===> i have loved this book since my  th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago . and i have read it to every one of my  rd and  th grade classes over my past   years of teaching . supposedly a movie had been made in the past  but i  d never been able to locate it . well  my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l  engle  s excellent book to the screen .  br    br   as i watched the movie  i had the highest of hopes . as the film went on  i became more and more despondent . they had botched it badly  never had i been so let down by a favorite book  to  film adaption . i understand that films can  t stick strictly to a book  but they don  t need to change things for the sake of it  most  if not all  of departures from the book were totally unnecessary   br    br   i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie . well  it wasn  t just me . nearly every single one felt the same way   cheated out of the great story that madeline l  engle had so skillfully created   br    br   why  they wondered  did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie  why couldn  t calvin  s hair have been red  why did mrs . which not have the proper  witch  like  outfit that was such a clever play on her name  basically  we all wondered   why did nearly every single detail have to be changed   br    br   i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make . i am still waiting for that movie . this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses . i  m going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task   

=======================================================================================================

264 ===> i found it hard to like anyone in this film . the central characters  lindy and michael chamberlain  whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback  are not bad people  but then surely not all  or even most  of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better . but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life  s tragic disarray  the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip  news media  crowds  mobs and assumptions . it  s not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular it  s merely an account of a true story that happened there . society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are .  br    br   when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine  s dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog  when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines  newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy  there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one  s own unaware perceptions  influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one  s life . the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out  from the victims to the masses .  br    br   the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside  suspicion was jet  fueled mostly by a virtue of hers . to the public eye  she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter . why was she able to keep her cool  even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up  for tv and the press  how much of the downward spiral could  ve been prevented had she behaved more to the public  s liking in the media  meryl streep  one of  if not the  greatest actress working today  may not give a performance that particularly stands out  and frankly neither does any other actor  or department of film  making . but she  and the screenwriters  do understand lindy . what is infuriating is that it  s not that difficult . apparently  she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case . whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense  we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation .  br    br   whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie  s choice  the devil wears prada  angels in america or other such work  it is a triumph . it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself . she frustrates us because we don  t know what she  s thinking or feeling . it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her  but this is the movie  s way of suggesting the reaction of the public  s attention .  br    br   she is married to a pastor  and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most . initially  they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god  s will  kick  starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter  s death was some sort of ritual killing on their part . whatever happened to the little girl  her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media  s intake didn  t immediately identify  so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry . . . well . . .  br    br   meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen  but the australian public plays the real leads here . like punctuation for each plot advance  director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office  where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections .  br    br   this golan  globus docudrama is not particularly memorable . the setting  s atmosphere doesn  t give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out . but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public .  

=======================================================================================================

265 ===> i have read the whole  a wrinkle in time  book and then saw the movie . the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was    pages and the film was  hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting .  br    br   a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg  charles wallace  and calvin must team together to find meg  s father and get off the island camazotz .  br    br   the beginning of the film is really a stinker . the acting is awful  the direction is laughable  and so far the situations aren  t necessary . i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie  made a great book  and a terrible film . the acting is worse than any straight  to  video acting . yes  i got to admit there was cool effects . but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible . if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie . i wish could give it a  but sadly i can only give it  . a half could have been useful .  

=======================================================================================================

266 ===> this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor . i don  t see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor  i just don  t think she did a very good job . bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie . they are going by train to davis  s relatives house . davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest . but when they arrive home  their is a nazi living there and their  s not much either can do about it . it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas . their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself .  

=======================================================================================================

267 ===> i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it . the movie  however  did not meet my expectations . having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies . the characters didn  t seem to fit very well with the book . the direction was weak . i had a hard time getting into the characters . there wasn  t a real connection with the viewer about what was going on . the dialog didn  t explain adequately what was happening . it just seemed slapped together and rushed through . all in all i was very disappointed with the movie . i suppose if you haven  t read the book  it might be ok by itself . at the very least  it might entice you to read the book  which you  ll probably enjoy more .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

268 ===> meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense . based on the book  evil angels  and titled so in its australian release  a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch . it presents a scenario that  s all too real for us in america the witch  hunt against a person deemed an easy target .  br    br   lindy chamberlain was this woman . being someone who spoke her mind  someone who didn  t play the sympathy card  and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal  she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn  t kill her own child . the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece . and through it all  lindy remained as stoic as ever  even when her husband michael was falling apart .  br    br   this stance  of course  is the power of strength  as unsympathetic as it may look like  and people happen to react strongly to that . they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn  not sit there and look blank . people don  t understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations . meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold  but not unfeeling woman  one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty . because of her  sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair   someone has to  or the chamberlains would be too detached  and no one wants to see that . except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news  media . they  ll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public .  

=======================================================================================================

269 ===> i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles . my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time  and would think  what an amazing movie this would make . sadly enough that screenwriter failed  changing characters  throwing in lame humor  and all out destroying the plot . i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie . but why can  t you stay true to the book  why must you change the way characters think and act  for those of you who have not read the book  pick it up  find a soft couch  and let your imagination run wild .  

=======================================================================================================

270 ===> this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears . meryl streep is excellent  as always  and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn  t particularly likable .  br    br   the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the    s . these real  life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled . i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating  why isn  t sam sheppard in jail   . the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure  and sheppard was tried and convicted . only after years in jail was he exonerated .  br    br   i love movies which tell a true story  do it in an interesting way  and make an important point in the process . this is one of those movies . other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include  hurricane    the thin blue line   and  breaker morant  . in particular  the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

271 ===> these were over   minutes of semi unexpected boredom . first  i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that . then  reaching   th minute i was convincing myself that it  s only a few more minutes  and i lasted to the very end which i  m kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for human  s patience and crap tolerance . was it worth watching at all  well  as i wrote above  if you want to test yourself  give it a try and if you  re strong willed enough  you may even last to the end . . . the movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all . all happenings in the movie  you can be sure you saw somewhere before  and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel .  

=======================================================================================================

272 ===> meryl streep was incredible in this film . she has an amazing knack for accents  and she shows incredible skill in this film overall . i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted . she was played realistically  too . she got cranky  upset  and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt . i didn  t expect much from the film initially  but i really got interested in it  and the movie is based on a real person and real events . it turned out to be better than i had anticipated . sam neill was also outstanding this is the best work i  ve seen from him  and i  ve really liked him in other movies  the piano  for example  . i gave the film a   but if i could rate just the acting  i  d give the it a  .   and a perfect   for streep .  

=======================================================================================================

273 ===> as a writer i find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face . talk about insulting . i was writing better stories than this in  th grade . bad acting  bad writing  bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure .  br    br   the only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time . who would green light something so poorly written  it  s not artistic  clever  smart  suspenseful  mysterious  scary  dramatic  nothing .  br    br   the characters are flat and boring with no development . the plot is as recycled as an aluminum can . they somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next  pulp fiction  . this script should have been used to line a bird cage  not a movie .  br    br   oh and last but not least  a       lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow .  br    br   avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an std .  

=======================================================================================================

274 ===> some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them . as i watched this film  made in      in      i thought i was watching the o . j . simpson debacle  although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation  .  br    br   the australian news media  if this movie is to be believed  devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought . it was scary to see the scenes of invasive  swarming media hordes  ridiculous accounts of half  truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society .  br    br   equally appalling is the media  s depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case . i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case  the accused are seven  day adventists  .  br    br   today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important .  br    br   streep is excellent as usual  and this is the best i  ve ever seen sam neill . the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible .  

=======================================================================================================

275 ===> or  marlowe at sea  . yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey . quite talky  too . bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films always in control of a situation  never nervous  no matter how dangerous a situation  calls women  slim  and  dames  and other such nonsense  is the only  real male  i . e . alpha male in the movie  the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo  but he is only a fat alpha male male   and  naturally  every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction . the character clichs are all here . bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic  about  to  reform as in  casablanca   and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them  but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him  it doesn  t  so he can  t be a cynic hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the  cool lone cynic  and yet a well  meaning humanitarian . i don  t think so . . . bacall does her non  chalant  cool babe  routine for the first time  and there are plenty of overrated  not all  too interesting so  called  sexual innuendo  exchanges between her and bogey these dialogues sound silly by today  s standards .  just purse your lips and whistle . . .  . a load of crap . . . she was   when this was made but looks a lot older  and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day . her bony face  with its sharp features  is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland  the cuteness of a myrna loy  let alone the likability of an irene dunne . bacall was more suited for playing vampires  not femme  fatales .  in real life she is very much like her face a hollywood bitch .  there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears very unsuitable for her character . there are two or three bad musical numbers  but my fast  forward button was ready .  br    br   if you  re interested in reading my  biographies  of bogart  bacall  huston  and other hollywood personalities  contact me by e  mail .

276 ===> mat spirogolou  s  toby malone  family know he is a talented footballer  and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club . they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him .  br    br   but the cousins are like chalk and cheese one a naive farm boy  the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters . mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day .  br    br   having missed his cousin george  damien robertson  on arrival in the city  mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one .  br    br   toby malone  probably better known for his work in theatre  puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager . there are telltale signs of a low budget  but as with so many other low  budget movies there  s more fun  seemingly more spontaneity  and more charm  than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster .

277 ===> a family moves into a old house in japan . but there  s a catch it  s haunted  boo     . aw  didn  t mean to make you jump . it  s only a review . settle back down . ahem  now anyways it  s haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife  her lover in slow motion . this naturally makes a  minutes scene stretch out to about  or  . horrid acting . horrid story . but how bad can it be you ask  well it was so bad my brain started to melt  leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips . it was so bad whenever doug mcclure came on  screen i prayed that i had flashbacks of small wonder  yes  i know doug was in  out of this world   not  small wonder   but it  s pretty much the same damn show   i can hum the  small wonder  theme better  there are movies that are so bad they  re good . this isn  t one of those  br    br   where i saw it showtime beyond  br    br   my grade f   br    br   eye candy mako hattori gets topless  susan george gets  love scenes  one nude  one just topless   br    br

278 ===> i  ve just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be . toby malone  s performance really stood out  i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film  which itself is a lot of fun  very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters  quite an achievement considering it  s short running time . there are plenty of good twists throughout as well  it will keep you guessing until the end . other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse . it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don  t let that put you off  you could do a lot worse than checking this out  you won  t regret it . good fun .      

=======================================================================================================

279 ===> aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting  this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia . i can  t imagine anyone actually thinking this was a  good movie .   

=======================================================================================================

280 ===> plato  s run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey . it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to . gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer  scarface  and action star jeff speaksman  the expert  . what i liked about plato  s run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato  s sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato  s run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it  out of

281 ===> that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days .  br    br   first of all  there is such a thing as the art of cinematography . just picking up a   mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie .  br    br   i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn  t pick up someone  s camcorder . . .  br    br   second  indie films are supposed to be about real people . there  s nothing real in this film . none of the characters come across as being even remotely human .  br    br   what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how  cool and edgy  he is .  br    br   sorry  but this is not good writing  or good directing .  br    br   what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance . hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted . . .  br    br   in any case  it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand .  

=======================================================================================================

282 ===> the previous reviewer has said it exactly . i saw it once  was enchanted  saw it a second time when it was re  broadcast within a week or two of the first airing . i still remember some of the scenes . the setting is the opening of the   th century  the war referred to in the title is world war i . one of the scenes was set in a women  only section of a public place  which was an interesting historical note . the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all  time great movie moments . i don  t think of this as a  gay movie   it  s an interesting and tender period love story  where the two principals happen to be women . i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd .

283 ===> the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads  kushiata kyoto  japan      . a young japanese trainee samurai named masanori  toshiya maruyama  walks up the winding path to the house  inside waits otami  mako hattori  with whom he is having an affair behind her husband  shugoro  s  tsuiyuki sasaki as toshiyuki sasaki  back who happens to be masanori  s teacher . shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other . his honour destroyed the enraged samurai brutally murders both otami and masanori before committing suicide . over a century later and ted fletcher  edward albert  arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura  susan george  and their young daughter amy  amy barrett  . their close friend alex curtis  doug mcclure  who works for the american consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay  you don  t need me to you where  he jokingly says it  s going so cheap because it  s haunted  to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don  t believe in ghosts  at least for the time being that is . almost immediately the film goes into clich mode . lights turn on and off by themselves  laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local zen monk  henry mitowa  gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it  s too late which they ignore  of course . the spirits of otami  masanori and shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a majyo witches  tsuyako olajima  curse put upon them . but there may be a way they can break the curse  unfortunately for the fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage  daughter and possibly even their very lives .  br    br   directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film  ok to watch once if you  ve got nothing better to do but after a day or two you  ll probably have completely forgotten it . nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there  s nothing particularly good about the film either . the script by robert suhosky from the novel by james hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by  the  numbers  a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn  t help things . there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get amy and her babysitter  noriko  mayumi umeda  . and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in  however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in  some exorcism  one more thing  i think it was a bad idea to have doug mcclure who was   when he made this  try his hand at kung  fu and oriental sword fighting  george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with mcclure  although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present . apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there  s no blood  gore or violence to speak about . the  transparent  ghost effects are ok but they ain  t going to impress many people these days . it  s professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in america  england or any western country without having to change a thing . an ok time waster .

284 ===> almost   years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender . periodically  i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd . it  s september of      and i keep hoping   deep sigh .  br    br   one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime  time evening soap the other  frances lee mccain  was seen in small roles here and there for a few years . but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced  as i recall it  on a short  lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up  and  coming playwrights .  br    br   i watched it every time it was shown on pbs  maybe  or  times . that was before the era of vcrs  so i have no record of it  except in my mind  s eye .  br    br             addition to above happy new year  ladies  this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper . org . my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer  s own personal copy .  

=======================================================================================================

285 ===> at the beginning of the film  you might double  check the dvd cover and re  read the synopsis a couple of times  but no worries . it  s not  memoirs of a geisha  that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be . still  the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie  as it shows how in the year     a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery . he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara  kiri  ritual suicide through disembowelment  . cut to present day  when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago . from then onwards  this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional . let  s start with the good aspects  namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all  time favorite british horror wench  well  together with britt eckland  linda hayden and ingrid pitt  . the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent  imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter . the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff . the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan  s ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress  in this  possessed  state  she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests . so  strictly spoken  it  s not really  evil  that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long  dead hands  obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening  especially since the light  blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in  ghostbusters  .  the house where evil dwells  is probably the least scary ghost movie ever . throughout most of the running time  you  ll be wondering whether director kevin connor  who nevertheless made the excellent horror films  motel hell  and  from beyond the grave   intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over  the  top  like  motel hell  maybe . but then again  everyone in the cast continues to speak his  her lines with a straight and sincere face  so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed .  the house where evil dwells  is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn  t even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning . i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds  but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights . well  those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over  sized spiders  or are they crabs   in the daughter  s bedroom . how totally random and irrelevant was that  if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation  make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep .  br    br   trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demon  mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba .  

=======================================================================================================

286 ===> having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised . reality check the original series wasn  t that good . i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke  s legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted . the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks  the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment . it  s amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series .  br    br   back to the movie . if you watch this film in it  s own right  not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series  then it  s not bad at all . the real star is of course the general lee . the car chases and stunts are excellent and that  s really what d . o . h . is all about . johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb  and  dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved . the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy  burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m . c . gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p . coltrane  the way he always should have been .  br    br   if you don  t like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn  t be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect . otherwise if you want an entertaining car  action movie with a few good laughs that  s not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind .  

=======================================================================================================

287 ===> from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb  this movie seems to get ragged on a lot  but i didn  t think it was that bad . i  ve seen much worse  actually .  br    br    the house where evil dwells  is a ghost story about a husband and his wife  ted and laura fletcher  and their daughter  amy  who move into an old house in japan . little do they know  a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover  and then killed himself    years earlier with a samurai sword . as strange things happen in the house  the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living  and plan on re  enacting the bloody murder that took place    years back .  br    br   i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance  from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story . it was routine  and it was corny  but i  ve seen worse in my day . the ghost sequences were a little over  done  we get to see the translucent blue  tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family  and take over their bodies . to be honest  the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland . i may be mistaken  but after watching this  it seemed to me that the japanese horror film  ju  on the grudge  and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little . the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place  ghostly activity  curses put on the home  etc . but i may be wrong .  br    br   to sum it up  this is a pretty corny ghost story . don  t go out of your way to see it  but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot .     .  

=======================================================================================================

288 ===> loved the movie . i even liked most of the actors in it . but  for me ms . davis  very poor attempt at an accent  and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch . seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms . davis they would be laughed off the screen .  br    br   i really think she  phoned this one in  . now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more .  br    br   i guess i just don  t  get  bette davis . i  ve always thought of her as an actor that  plays herself  no matter what role she  s in . the possible exception is now voyager .  br    br   i  m sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful  and i hope civil  detail how i am totally wrong on this . but  i  ll continue to watch the movies she  s in because i like the stories  writing  supporting casts  but  i  ll always be thinking  of different actresses that could have done a better job .  

=======================================================================================================

289 ===> i just rented and watched this movie just to see what  s all the fuss about . so here  s what my reactions to it are . it  s easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors . the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists . this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film . however  the movie doesn  t shock or disturb me at all . it just bored me . this movie could be easily shortened to under   minutes . all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time  like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below .  br    br   contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame . i don  t know if i have watched the cut or uncut version  if there is actually such a version . i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot . here  s a list on top of my mind .  br    br   why don  t the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are . that would be an excellent time .  br    br   why don  t they just gang rape her  instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer  s ordeal by such a long time . it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way .  br    br   i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house . maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles .  br    br   these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right  they shouldn  t send a coward imbecile to do the job .  br    br   why didn  t jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left  which should be the first thing that pops up in most people  s mind  especially for someone who is a writer .  br    br   why didn  t these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive   br    br   i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him . ends spoiler  br    br   but hey  this movie is not without its merits  camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer  why me  why me  i didn  t even cm      

=======================================================================================================

290 ===> this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure . the genii in the bottle is a classic scene . romantic in it  s finish  all things turn out as they should be . i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true .

291 ===> okay  you have  br    br   penelope keith as miss herringbone  tweed  b . b . e .  backbone of england .  she  s killed off in the first scene  that  s right  folks this show has no backbone   br    br   peter o  toole as ol  colonel cricket from the first war and now the emblazered lord of the manor .  br    br   joanna lumley as the ensweatered lady of the manor    years younger than the colonel and   years past her own prime but still glamourous  brit spelling  not mine  enough to have a toy  boy on the side . it  s alright  they have col . cricket  s full knowledge and consent  they guy even comes  round for christmas   still  she  s considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy  boy her own age  what a gal    br    br   david mccallum as said toy  boy  equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze . pilcher couldn  t come up with any cover for him within the story  so she gave him a hush  hush job at the circus .  br    br   and finally  br    br   susan hampshire as miss polonia teacups  venerable headmistress of the venerable girls  boarding  school  serving tea in her office with a dash of deep  poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation . her best bit of advice  i  ve only been to nancherrow  the local stately home of england  once . i thought it was very beautiful but  somehow  not part of the real world .  well  we can  t say they didn  t warn us .  br    br   ah  susan  time was  your character would have been running the whole show . they don  t write  em like that any more . our loss  not yours .  br    br   so  with a cast and setting like this  you have the re  makings of  brideshead revisited   right   br    br   wrong  they took these   dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well . after all  acting is one of the oldest temp  jobs there is  you name another    br    br   first warning sign lots and lots of backlighting . they get around it by shooting outdoors   hey  it  s just the sunlight    br    br   second warning sign leading lady cries a lot . when not crying  her eyes are moist . that  s the law of romance novels leading lady is  dewy  eyed .   br    br   henceforth  leading lady shall be known as l . l .  br    br   third warning sign l . l . actually has stars in her eyes when she  s in love . still  i  ll give emily mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes  i wonder . did they use contacts    br    br   and lastly  fourth warning sign no on  screen female character is  mrs .  she  s either  miss  or  lady .   br    br   when all was said and done  i still couldn  t tell you who was pursuing whom and why . i couldn  t even tell you what was said and done .  br    br   to sum up they all live through world war ii without anything happening to them at all .  br    br   ok  at the end  l . l . finds she  s lost her parents to the japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic . meanwhile  there  s always a  meanwhile    some young guy l . l . had a crush on  when  i don  t know  comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by lady of the manor  must be some street if she  s going to find him there .  both war casualties are whisked away to recover at nancherrow  somebody has to be  whisked away  somewhere in these romance stories    br    br   great drama .  

=======================================================================================================

292 ===> a fantastic arabian adventure . a former king  ahmad  and his best friend  the thief abu  played by sabu of black narcissus  search for ahmad  s love interest  who has been stolen by the new king  jaffar  conrad veidt  . there  s hardly a down moment here . it  s always inventing new adventures for the heroes . personally  i found ahmad and his princess a little boring  there  s no need to ask why john justin  who plays ahmad  is listed fourth in the credits  . conrad veidt  always a fun actor  makes a great villain  and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves  who at one point finds a genie in a bottle . i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra  the father of the princess . he collects amazing toys from around the world . jaffar bribes him for his daughter  s hand with a mechanical flying horse . this probably would count as one of the great children  s films of all time  but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays . kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together . and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful . although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time  willis o  brien  s stop  motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn  t even look remotely like a spider .     .  

=======================================================================================================

293 ===> being a filmmaker myself  and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour  i thought i was in for a treat when i took home  my wrongs . . .   not that the dvd cover gives anything away  instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director  chris morris   a short film including scenes   . i should have known better really  and avoided this insipid  and often offensive  piece of twoddle .  br    br   the scene in the church is repulsive to watch  especially since we are all too familiar with morris  s warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series  brass eye  and serves no purpose other than to shock . how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand .  br    br   the runner  s commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle  having been a runner myself  it  s often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process   however this is sadly not the case here . instead  we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film  before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs . this is all very interesting  but not worth a single frame of celluloid .  br    br   to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement . it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style  at the expense of plot  character and dialogue  leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled . its over  simplified message  that man should take responsibility for his actions  is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated .  br    br   the film does have its moments of pseudo  kafkaesque surrealism  but ultimately  it fails to convince  to entertain  to enlighten and just ends up being irritating . if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking  i strongly recommend  franz kafka  s it  s a wonderful life   by peter capaldi .  

=======================================================================================================

294 ===> although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special .  br    br   if you  ve never seen this film before you  ll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers . i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney  s aladdin cribbed from the film . they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers .  br    br   i  ve given the film an  out of   instead of a   out of ten  which is where a good portion of this film dwells  because in the final   minutes the film falls apart in the pacing . everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end . from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting . it doesn  t kill the film  but it does weaken it .  br    br   still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale  or even a great movie .  

=======================================================================================================

295 ===> one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying  it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked . one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they  the yuppies  are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art . while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning  i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner . if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home  i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies .  

=======================================================================================================

297 ===> enough is enough . . . sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead . the first tremors movie was great . the second one was ridiculous . the third one was nauseating . the tv series was depressingly awful . and this movie just drives the stake deeper .  br    br   basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry  now we have the series set in the wild west  in the      s  and they fight graboids . like a rehash of the first one  they have to learn how to beat them all over again . mildly entertaining i suppose . otherwise this straight  to  video release  just like tremors  and   is just going way too far . oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place . . . did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event  i think something like this would be history  making  so our pals in the first film wouldn  t be so unprepared .  br    br   movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy . avoid this garbage .  

=======================================================================================================

298 ===> i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess . as any kid would be  i was delighted with the imagination  inventiveness and energy of the film . several years later  i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing . i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years . in addition to the script  the production transcends the fantasy genre . this is korda  the storyteller at his very best . when you see thief as a child you know that youve had a great time . when you see thief as an adult you know that youve seen a masterpiece . its as timeless as the story it treats . an amazing work .  br    br   thomas mccarthy  

=======================================================================================================

299 ===> just a few words . . . . this movie really sucks . it  s like those tv movies with bad cast and plot . it  s amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii . don  t waste your time watching this crap  even if you like the tremors movies .  

=======================================================================================================

300 ===> this film  was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that  unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it  s quality while i grew up . this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children  it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well . the only drawback there is  is that one can not see past the bad  effects  compared to the effects nowadays  like one could when one was a child . i remembered nothing of those effects  of course it had been about ten years since i  d seen this film  when i was about eleven years old . who then watches effects  one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides . in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the   th century . coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film . there is comedy  romance and adventure all in one  which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern  it succeeds in not being dusty and old . all of that is mainly due to the great story  the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors . in that department sabu  as abu  and conrad veidt  as jaffar  stand out  providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part . great film and although an  oldie   definitely a goldie  . i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday .  br    br    out of    

=======================================================================================================

301 ===> warning this review contains minor spoilers .  br    br   well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas . i  m a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare . tremors   the legends begins  however  is a very dull movie . where the heck are the graboids     br    br   due to the relative lack of graboids through the first   minutes i  m convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a  character study  . unfortunately there isn  t one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago  s character who is given too few lines  too little to do and in the end too little screen time . what saved the  nd and  rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer . whenever there wasn  t any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and  or watch . however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute .  br    br   on the plus side when the graboids  dirt dragons in this movie  are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets .  br    br   i was impressed when i saw that tremors  was listed at    minutes long . pretty good for straight to video . but after watching it i  m sure that this movie is a good   minutes too long . there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn  t further the plot any . was there a rush to get this movie made  i think not  more time could have and should have been spent on the script .  br    br   i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors  packaged for sale with . . . . tremors    what luck i thought  pay for   get   for free . well after watching tremors  i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free  i can  t imagine paying a single dime for tremors  . for fans of the series it  s best to forget that tremors   the legend begins even exists .  br    br   tremors   the legend begins rates a  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

302 ===> i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once . the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious  you sons of a thousand fleas  .  br    br   it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about     am once and it had just started . tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work .  br    br         

=======================================================================================================

303 ===> as if the storyline wasn  t depressing enough  this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher . weird stuff . then there  s the core premise of the hero  heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he  s besot  ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl . is this person a psycho  a masochist  just a doomed queen who takes things too far  and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have  just that he didn  t get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly . he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did  but it  s really really so hard to empathize . such sad and unusual self destruction . was it supposed to be funny  what was it all about really   

=======================================================================================================

304 ===> the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all  time favorite movies . it is exciting without gore  it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless . the casting couldn  t have been better . rex ingram made me believe in genies . and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar . he set the bar very high .  br    br   . . i watch this movie at least twice a year . . . and never tire of it . this film is an adventure for all ages . . no  one too old to enjoy it . the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time . . . i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u . s . was just about to enter wwii . conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying  evilness  a few years later in  casablanca .  and korda teamed up  i believe  with justin and dupree again in  the four feathers  . . . . great film  making   

=======================================================================================================

305 ===> it  s funny . i  ve seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting  while others are repellent and self  indulgent messes   like this film . for me  it ranges from great to crap   without much in the middle . i know he has a lot of fans among the  sophisticated   but i can  t help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype . from my point of view  and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this   he made too many movies too quickly and was too self  indulgent . his gay or gender  bending films  like this one  tend to be really bad   sloppily done  sometimes quite boring  such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant  and sometimes just gross  like this film  . couldn  t his message about acceptance of a person  s gender  confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered  show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic   then  maybe  i  d care about the films .  br    br   i  m honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films   the bad seems to be out  weighing the good .  

=======================================================================================================

306 ===> i grew up with this as my all  time favorite film . the special effects are incredible for the era  and won awards . i can remember the dialogue as if i  d heard it yesterday . it is simply a great  timeless adventure . the music is by miklos rosza  who is cinema history  s best . sabu is the thief . conrad veidt is the grand villain . i have a copy within reach  for the next trip down memory lane . whoa there  rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle   

=======================================================================================================

307 ===> this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the  seinfeld  show  patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he  s noticeably slimmer here . oliver reed got top billing but he  s hardly in the film at all . warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him . eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they  re is so much nudity in the film . if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they  re turn with him . then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there  s the bloody standoff . no real political message like the film  burn  but just another contrived plot device to move the story along . incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back  i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad . the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton  s lack of any accent make it at times laughable . very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel .  

=======================================================================================================

308 ===> like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there  s plot  plot and more plot it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life  then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man  s present  where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come .  it must be admitted that the second half doesn  t quite live up to the promise of the first .  like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle  eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work . a freed genie  a beautiful princess  a flying carpet  fantastic mechanical toys  sea voyages  a crowded marketplace  a wicked vizier  jewels . . . i don  t know why it all works  but it does . everything is just so beautiful . the sets are beautiful . june duprez is beautiful . rozsa  s score is especially beautiful . as usual  it sounds hungarian but somehow he manages to convince us that he  s being hungarian in a persian way .  

=======================================================================================================

309 ===> this would  ve been a great silent film . the acting really is good  at least in a look ma  i  m doing really big acting  sort of way .  br    br   everything is huge . every line is profound  every scene is shattered by human tragedy   br    br   mostly  i felt like gagging . yet  like any train wreck  i couldn  t tear my eyes away . this dialogue might  ve worked on the stage  although i doubt it . on the screen  it was cluttered  haphazard  hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work .  br    br   if you enjoy your melodrama in huge  heaping doses  you might enjoy the movie . be prepared to wait  however . for all that melodrama  this thing sure plods along at its own pace .  br    br   this script must  ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves . it simply doesn  t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera .  br    br   imdb does us a great disservice  at times  when it uses its goofy computer  controlled  weighted score  . curse of the starving class deserves less than a  .  br    br   character  driven fiction is great  but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution  it isn  t character development  your characters must have a motivation . being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development . that  s a plot contrivance .  br    br   stay away from this movie . or at the very least  watch it muted . perhaps you  ll get some amusement from all the arm  waving the characters do .  br    br   oh  and word to the wise   to prove that this is truly an artsy film  you see james woods in all his dangly male  look  at  me  i  m  the  figurative  and  literal  representation  of  the  naked  vulnerability  of  man  glory .  br    br   don  t say you weren  t warned .  

=======================================================================================================

310 ===> i have to agree with mr . caruso jr lanza  s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it . see the film you  ll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house . someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza . as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn  t good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring .  

=======================================================================================================

311 ===> how many more of those fake  slice of life  movies need to be made  hopefully not too many .  br    br   raising victor vargas is a very self  conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood . nothing wrong with that in general . what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich in the book of supposedly  edgy  hollywood independent production .  br    br   it  s supposed to be  real  so left shake the camera  documentary style   except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose . . .  br    br   it  s  edgy  so let  s not waste any time lighting the film .  br    br   it  s  hip   so let  s have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface . . .  br    br   and so on  and so forth . all that you are left with is a very self  conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won  t impress anyone outside of the  rarefied  indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film .  

=======================================================================================================

312 ===> this is a most handsome film . the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color . other indoor scenes at various mansions  etc are equally brilliant . as for the music  what more can be said other than that lanza  s voice was at its  peak as he sang so many of the worlds  best known and beloved arias . the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony . of course  hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso . there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events . for example  the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth . there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him . these web sites can be located by using any good search engine . there are also several books available concerning his life history . but  the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film . the voices of lanza  kirsten  and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie . enjoy  i know that i sure did .  

=======================================================================================================

313 ===> firstly  i am not easily scared by . . . anything except for my few phobias  but this movie is absolutely horrific . this is not appropriate for children at all  i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i . couldn  t believe how gory it was for a children  s movie  bunnies being brutally murdered  it  s just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g . i recommend being over  to see this . but don  t get me wrong  it was probably a good movie if i wasn  t scarred mentally as a child . i cannot believe a parent would allow a  let  s say   year old child to watch this . it  s just to intense and complicated  not to forget gory  for young kids . i  m wayy over  and i was shocked by the violence . i don  t recommend  

=======================================================================================================

314 ===> since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio  i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso .  br    br   but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro  goldwyn  mayer had mario lanza under contract . no one else could have done it  i doubt whether it will ever be tried again .  br    br   and why should it . i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen . for his tenor voice was his life  his reason for being on the earth .  br    br   to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest . caruso  like the man who portrayed him  was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline . he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film .  br    br   his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought . he  s shown in a recording studio once late in his life . actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became .  br    br   when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live . but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men . it  s why both became the legends that they are .  br    br   what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza  a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera . the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design .  br    br   mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso . unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn  t get an actual cast album with ann blyth  dorothy kirsten  and jarmila novotna also .  br    br   though blyth sang it in the film  lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso .  br    br   if you  re looking for a life of enrico caruso  this ain  t it . if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career  than you should not miss the great caruso .  

=======================================================================================================

315 ===> this movie is great  mind you  but only in the way it tells a very bad story . stella is so terribly crude  and never learns better . her husband is incredibly snobby and small  minded . neither ever learns better . is this realistic  somehow  stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners  dress  yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down  i don  t think so . stella is a good woman  and a very good mother . giving up herself  so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting .  br    br   much of what we see might have been normal for the times  people having a beer or two  enjoying a player piano  dancing  but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority .  i can  t have our child living this way   spare me .  br    br   this story tells me one thing that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes . and that is simply a load of hogwash .  

=======================================================================================================

316 ===> jesse and celine  ethan hawke and julie delpy  are two strangers on a european train . the two come from widely different backgrounds  he  s american and she  s french  after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him . during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other . but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise .  br    br   this wonderful romantic  comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline . written and directed by richard  dazed and confused  linklater   before sunrise  never bores because of its  small cast . in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two . smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans .  

=======================================================================================================

317 ===> did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did  the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last . oh my god . it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy . not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been . most reviews have read have been glowing but i really can  t understand why . i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought  no  they would never do that  that  s far too lame .  i can hardly stand it . i feel so unsatisfied . i think i  m about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own . someone please . change my mind . i want to love this . so bad . someone tell me why i  m wrong . great show . terrible ending .  

=======================================================================================================

318 ===> an american woman  her european husband and children return to her mother  s home in  watch on the rhine   a     film based on the play by lillian hellman  and starring paul lukas  whom i believe is repeating his stage role here   bette davis  lucile watson  george coulouris  geraldine fitzgerald  and donald woods . an anti  fascist  a worker in the underground movement  many times injured  and wanted by the nazis  kurt muller  lukas  is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother  in  law . but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests  coulouris  is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out .  br    br   great performances abound in this film  written very much to put forth lillian hellman  s liberal point of view . it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released  as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes . the movie  s big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in  casablanca .  humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick  but lukas is transcendent as kurt . the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut  wrenching  just to mention one scene .  br    br   though this isn  t what one thinks of as a bette davis movie  she gives a masterful performance here as kurt  s loyal and loving wife  sara . her acting tugs at the heart  and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender .  br    br   the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions . lillian hellman is not everyone  s cup of tea  but unlike  the little foxes   she has written some truly sympathetic  wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers . highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

319 ===> there are many good things about the new bsg there  s the multiple cylon roles for model  and   for example  which the two actresses played superbly . there  s the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica   my ship will not be networked  over my dead body    also  all the space battles  the special effects  even though the seasoned sci  fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all  the darkness of the characters  their essentially flawed nature .  br    br   that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish .  br    br   yes  the first part  the scenes in space  the raid on the cylons and all that was very good . but the mushy ending  i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden  so i never know how much time is left until the end . so for me it was a special kind of torture  to see the end happen over and over again . every time i thought  oh this is the final scene  the final shot  i got one more . every frakking character got its complete ending  that wasn  t really necessary .  br    br   what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all the young roslin scenes . why is important for us to know that a she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and b that she has a one night stand with a former pupil  student  what does that bring to the story  where was the linkage  now  i  m all for a more european  ish style approach  and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows  and all that  but this was just ridiculous . this didn  t bring anything meaningful to the story .  br    br   also  i  ve seen the  last frakkin special  and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot he couldn  t come up with a good ending for the story  so . . . . he just didn  t  it  s never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be . the whole  this was thousands of years in the past  idea  the mitochondrial eve thing  was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy  and believe you me  there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h  g  storyline . and speaking of hera  now there  s a storyline that was not worked out well  at all . instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil who  s   years younger . don  t get me wrong  i  m all for older women with younger men . the more power to them . but this . . . just made no sense .  br    br   all in all   the writing in  this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be . that goes even moreso for the last episode . i hope lost and   do better  with their series finales .  

=======================================================================================================

320 ===> i must admit that at the beginning  i was sort of reticent about watching this movie . i thought it was this stupid  little  romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him . i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script  since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie . still  i watched it  and i was amazed . . .  before sunrise  is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way  wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth  we are sentenced to death  or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity  or that  we  humans  can afford sometimes to live in fairy  tales .  br    br   the ending was wonderfully chosen  we do not know if they will meet again in six months  at six o  clock  in vienna  s station   in our optimism  we sincerely hope so . the actors acted in a very good manner  so  that  i began to believe that i  myself could live a love  story just like this .  

=======================================================================================================

321 ===> the fight scenes were great . loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side . it was the ending that i hated . i was disappointed that it was earth but    k years back . but to travel all that way just to start over  are you kidding me    k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise  they abandon technology  no way . sure they were eating paper and rationing food  but that is over . they can live like humans again . they only have one good doctor . what are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth . . . yea right . no one would have made that choice .  

=======================================================================================================

322 ===> my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together . . . which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism . . . and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships  as a lot has been written about the movie already  it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved .  br    br   i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending   hrs . . . the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with . . .  br    br   on the plot front  making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish . .  br    br   i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor  the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer  s and director  s mind . what the actors bring out is what becomes of them . . right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify . . . to become the character  the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story . . . here both the actors do just the right job  kudos . .    and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful

323 ===> the     s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world  with an emphasis on wild animals  exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures . despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place  and then bringing  em back alive  with the film footage   such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features . . . because there were no expensive sets  costumes  or high  priced movie stars .  br    br   the most successful makers of such films  artistically and financially  were the team of martin e . johnson and his wife osa  who made several documentaries  sometimes with blatantly staged events  in africa and asia . the johnsons  safari films were extremely popular  inspiring several parodies . . . most notably wheeler  woolsey  s  so this is africa   in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs . johnson  martini  instead of martin e . johnson  geddit   . although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time  the johnsons  films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour . viewed from our own more enlightened  i hope  standpoint  this is a serious flaw in the johnsons  documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife .  br    br   one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson . ten years younger than her husband  she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter . while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir  osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co  produced with her husband .  br    br    congorilla  is probably the best of the johnsons  films . the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in     . the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting  although these suffer from the johnsons  penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look  wild  and alien .  br    br   the best  and funniest  scene in  congorilla  is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women .  the dance is the black bottom  no less . . . the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton  the conjoined twins .  wearing jodhpurs  riding boots  and a pith helmet  osa johnson starts scat  singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women . meanwhile  they just stand there staring at her  apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish . it  s a very funny scene  but it has unpleasant undertones . osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration  using natural rhythm  i guess  because it  s in their blood  or something .  br    br   i  ll rate  congorilla   points out of   . this film says a little bit about african life in the     s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade .

324 ===> after a chance encounter on the train  a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna  discussing life and love . the primary reason to see  before sunrise   is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines . as  celine   this sexy  brainy  soulful brown  eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid  twenties . risking overstatement  celine is practically the ideal woman  unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural  unpretentious  introspective  and selflessly loving . we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak  for her sincere  intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating . further  her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing .  br    br   if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie  it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar . ethan hawke as  jessie  comes off like a vaguely appealing slob  sort of a maynard g . krebs of the nineties . attempting to appear detached and nonchalant  he sort of drags himself through certain shots . his pants fit poorly  his tee shirt is coming untucked  his wavy dark hair  his most attractive feature  needs a good washing  and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee . nevertheless  he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two  week train ride around europe  so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine . his oft  cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine  although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation . when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence  we know he is getting somewhere .  br    br   after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes  bars  and silly diversions  they agree that because they may never see one another again  they should make the most of it . jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass  looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up .  br    br   given his boundless luck in the romance department  it is especially irksome when jessie  as the very definition of a naive jerk  foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp . he contents himself with a half  baked plan  quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu  to reunite at the same spot in half a year . when the appointed time comes  you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another  perhaps even married and pregnant . for whatever reason  she probably won  t show  while jesse  who ends up working at target or  if he  s lucky  the local library  will go back to vienna  desperate to see her again  only to wind up alone .  br    br   despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion   before sunrise  is a beautiful movie . i highly recommend both it and the sequel   before sunset .   

=======================================================================================================

325 ===> i  d like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot    for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest  crappiest movie i  ve ever seen   br    br   i have no idea what  s wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here  imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings  . . . the only thing i can imagine is that people must  ve voted during one or more conditions  br    br    . while being shitfaced  stoned out of their minds  . they  ve received hard cash for the votes  . under gunpoint  br    br   i can  t believe i wasted a good  h   min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie .  

=======================================================================================================

326 ===> this movie is intelligent . that is  more than most other movies  it transcends the least common denominator  stupid people will probably not appreciate it . the story also relies heavily on dialogue . it has some parallels to lost in translation  although before sunrise is much brighter  somehow less abstract  and simply a lot better .  br    br   the script  the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic . the actors play absolutely brilliantly . rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together .  br    br   the dialogue moves into very personal issues  with the risk of becoming a little over the top . it does  however  stay on the right side almost all the time  although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing . balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors . sometimes  it yields great results  and overall this movie is simply stupendous  only very  very rarely is  love  in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic . every time that is achieved  the result is fantastic . i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect . she still looks stunning in this film    years after .  br    br   this is simply a gem of a movie that you can  t miss . one of the best movies i have seen from the     s   

=======================================================================================================

327 ===> i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started  taking over  the plane .  br    br   at first i thought maybe it should get a  one  for the comic relief . but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more   br    br   whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed . and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are . when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun . the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay . and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that .  br    br   this movie isn  t worth a trip to blockbuster . be warned if you pay for it  the only  victim  is your dumb ass .  br    br   if you want to be really scared  i suggest the descent . if you want humor  go to your local stand up comedy club . their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash .  

=======================================================================================================

328 ===> richard linklater  s beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the    s best thinking person  s romantic movies . julie delpy turns in one of the decade  s most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger  on  a  train ethan hawke . the dialogue  and there is oodles of it  is sometimes meandering and overly precious  but this portrait of two young wannabe  lovers making a romantic  intellectual  and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing  touching and insightful moments .  

=======================================================================================================

329 ===> the only thing great about the movie is its title . in this case   snake on a plane  is example of not judging the book by its cover  the title says nothing about the movie . when i went to the theater  i wasn  t expecting citizen kane  i was expecting independence day  a movie that  s pure popcorn fun  but instead  i got that horrible roy liotta movie called  turbulence  yes  this is how bad soap is . the only thing make soap better is its title . and it  s not even the apporiate title for the movie  the wasn  t even a glimpse of  snake  or  plane    minutes into the movie  what a false advertising  if it wasn  t for its title  soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b  grade summer movie . and the r rating  it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time  the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r  all of the violence are kept pg    level . you know what  s really r rated  the r rated superstar edge  see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake   

=======================================================================================================

330 ===> i watched this movie   years ago . and have watched it on video an average of once a year since . it  s the type of movie that  s timeless  because the themes are universal  yet the stories and conversation are so personal . it  s also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll  despite the fact that there are  really  just two  very involving  characters . this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy  who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine . this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv  and now  the phenomenon is rampant  i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space  and makes you think  however jaded you may be  that you are one of those characters . it also made me want to ride the train around europe  i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie . maybe that speaks about myself  my friends  or just the sheer genius of this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

331 ===> i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb . but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone  s been fixing the score .  br    br   either way it was a real disappointment . the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest . there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot  but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking  wouldn  t it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane  and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff     and that  s about it  the plot is thin and unoriginal . the snakes are bad cgi  but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone   . the acting is poor  and all people are unbelievable stereo types .  br    br   to sum it up it  s one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen  stay away   

=======================================================================================================

332 ===> i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago  but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking . it sparked my interest  but i never expected it to be this great . before sunrise is a masterpiece  and it  s also one of the most romantic films on record . to my surprise  it completely lacked the cynicism of the     s . it  s impossible to really talk too much about it  since there is no real plot  so to speak  although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre  where there is a conversation  but it  s not just the conversation that matters   but let me just say  see it . see it   

=======================================================================================================

333 ===>   raising victor vargas  is one of those light  family movies that you can watch and do the n . y . times crossword puzzle at the same time . and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona  you don  t have to  pause  the dvd . just let it roll   cause you won  t be missing anything really important . no twists  turns  or tension . it  s not really an ethnic movie  it  s a movie about a poor  struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino . they could have been any ethnic group . it made very little difference . i  ve seen it all a zillion times before . just plug in a jewish family  an italian family  a black family  or an irish family . just the accents and names were different . if the vargas family was named bush or clinton and were presbyterians  the movie would have been a total snooze .  br    br   it  s funny that the critics here couldn  t get the locale straight . some said it was spanish harlem . some the bronx  and another brooklyn . as a life  long new yorker  i vote for the lower east side . and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latinos . they lived in an insulated  isolated little enclave . some interaction with non  latinos might have created some excitement  interest  or tension . remember west side story   br    br   and now for the oft  criticized cinematography . i don  t know if it was my tv or what  but all the indoor shots looked very orange to me . the apt  the furniture  and the faces were all orange . what was that supposed to mean  and the apt . did look pretty cramped to me . somebody here mentioned that the old apt  s  tenements had very big rooms . well  maybe   years ago . what landlords have done is to break up one big apt into  or  very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them .  br    br   and another annoying thing . . . . this is the second family movie i  ve seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy  jerking off  . is this private sex act necessary for us to watch  please spare me  what  s up with these directors   br    br   so  victor vargas  is a pleasant little movie . it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents  which they did . but the writers let them down  giving them a flat  unspectacular script to work with . enjoy the show  but keep your fingers near the  fast forward  button .  

=======================================================================================================

334 ===>   before sunrise  is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top  favorite movies ever . dialog and acting are great . i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts . of course  the romantic vienna  introduced in the movie does not exist  you won  t find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night  and it isn  t possible to get to all the places in only one night  either  especially if you  re a stranger and it  s your first night in vienna  . but that  s not the point . the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic . although  nothing ever really happens  the movie never gets boring . the ending is genuinely sad without being  titanic  or something . even if you don  t like love stories you should watch this film  i  m a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer . the first part is perfect as it is  in my opinion .  

=======================================================================================================

335 ===> i saw the   p . m . showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special . although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back  as i don  t actually pay for movies anymore  i didn  t really find any redeeming qualities .  br    br   there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle  but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger  in mind more than age as this film is rated r  male audience . the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well . i know you all want to hear samuel l . say his infamous line  but let  s be honest  it  s a whole lot of hype for very little pay off . the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg  which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen .  br    br   now i am a reasonable man  i knew going into the theater that i wasn  t going to be seeing  casablanka   and i am at least thankful that this film is an original  albiet inane  idea and not some re  make or franchise spin off . however to be honest  if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months .  

=======================================================================================================

336 ===> before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation . richard linklater  s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people . the film depicts romance in all it  s glory  but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that  s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to  with just one problem  the problem of time . while most relationships wind down with time  this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out . before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental  hollywood romance   which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders . the story follows two people  jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna . they instantly connect  and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train  jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna . . .  br    br   before sunrise works principally for two reasons  realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life . this allows the characters to be free  and it  s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script . this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are  and not merely because they  re the protagonists . this kind of realism is hard to capture as  at the end of the day  we as the audience know that they  re watching a film and not observing real life but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen . a truly great script cannot work on it  s own  and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice  and although i  m not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke on viewing this film  there is nothing you can do but give them both respect . i don  t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves  but when a film is this good it hardly matters .  br    br   in a film like this  it is the writing that  s the most important thing  and contained within the script are several observations about life  most of which i personally could relate to . this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters  but it also manages to expose what true love is  along with several other aspects of life . the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing . everyone is different  and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people . there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that  s the case with the musings in this script . adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna . the city itself isn  t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere  but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat  energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location .  br    br   before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating . richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental . before sunrise is what it is . and what it is  is pure cinematic brilliance .

337 ===>        pyramid clues deep blue sea . tremors . slither . eight legged freaks .  br    br   pyramid category movies that were funnier and more thrilling than snakes on a plane .  br    br   hell  with that definition i  d have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and elaine in airplane  as superior to snakes in both laughs and thrills .  br    br   the sad truth is that this isn  t even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies anaconda  besides the never to be seen again casting of jlo  cube  o . wilson  stoltz  wuhrer in the same flick  you had jon voight pulling off the all  time cinematic heist . his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a  so  ludicrous  it  s  fun  movie .  br    br   in the end  snakes on a plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible . every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year  all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop  sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater . i heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for  according to jim  .  

=======================================================================================================

338 ===> forget the campy  religious  movies that have monopolized the television  film market . . . this movie has a real feel to it . while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws  it also has that message of forgiveness  and overall good morals . however  i did not like the lighting in this movie . . . for a movie dealing with such subject matter  it was too bright . i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie  which is almost an unforgivable sin  but the recognizable cast  and their performances counteract this oversight .  br    br   definitely worth seeing . . . buy the dvd .  

=======================================================================================================

339 ===> i went into this film with expectations  from the hype  that it would be insightful and uplifting . certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band  wilco .   br    br   instead we get a lot of moping and whining about  the process   a dishonorable and no doubt one  sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer  songwriter  a gut  wrenching confession by the fallen member  s friend   for like   years   saying the  friendship had run its course   and this whiny  uncompelling story about how one record label  hurt their feelings  by dumping them  only so that the band could immediately get   offers from other labels  oh  the tension . . . not   they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain  but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn  t exist . this doesn  t even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline  insight or even a decent job at cinematography . the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch .  br    br   from the film  this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don  t have and think they  re some kind of guardians for the art of music  which they most definitely are not . and i thought the music sucked  and i couldn  t even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer .  br    br   i give it a     .

340 ===> lillian hellman  one of america  s most famous women playwrights  was a woman with a mission . her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country . in her memoir  she recounts her trip to the then  soviet union  as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system .  watch on the rhine  must have come as a result of those years . the left wing in america  as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism  not only in europe  but in japan as well .  br    br    watch on the rhine  was a play produced on broadway eight months before the pearl harbor attack by the japanese . in it ms . hellman was heralding america  s entrance in world war ii . the adaptation is credited to ms . hellman and dashiell hammett  her long time companion . as directed for the screen by herman shumlin  the film was well received when it premiered in     .  br    br   we are introduced to the muller family  when the film opens . they are crossing the border to the united states from mexico . they are to continue toward mrs . muller  s home in washington  d . c .  where her mother  fanny farrelly  is a minor celebrity hostess . the mullers  we realize are fleeing europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in germany . in fact  we thought  in a way  the mullers could have been better justified if they were jewish  fleeing from a sure extermination .  br    br   we find out that mr . muller has had a terrible time in his native land  as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing fascim . little does he know that he is coming to his mother  in  law  s house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy .  br    br   the film offers excellent acting all around . it is a curiosity piece because of bette davis  supporting role . paul lukas  repeating his broadway role  is quite convincing as kurt muller  the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family . mr . lukas does a great job portraying kurt muller  repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on broadway .  br    br   the other best performance is by lucile watson  who plays fanny farrelly  the matriarch of this family . geraldine fitzgerald is seen as marthe de brancovis  a guest of the farrellys  married to the contemptible teck de brancovis  a nazi sympathizer  played by george coulouris . beulah bondi  donald woods  and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by mr . shumlin .  br    br   the film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule  no matter where .  

=======================================================================================================

341 ===> the idea had potential  but the movie was poorly scripted  poorly acted  poorly shot and poorly edited . there are lots of production flaws . . . for example  dr . lane  s daughter who never ages despite the passing years . wait for video  but don  t expect much .  

=======================================================================================================

342 ===> i just watched this movie for the second time  and enjoyed it as much as the first time . it is a very emotional and beautiful movie  with good acting and great family values . inspiring and touching   

=======================================================================================================

343 ===> this film had so much promise . i was very excited about this film . in the end  it was laughable at best  painful at worst . the acting styles ran the gamut from really  really  flat  the angels  the wife and daughter  to over  animated  casper  s character  . i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other . pay special attention to the scene regarding  the bug  . it  s pretty much an insult to the audience  s ability to figure things out . in defense of that scene  though  it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie . i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations . too bad they didn  t make use of it . i didn  t feel like i was transported to exotic locations . anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome . however  to end on a positive note  i thought the sets were pretty good . i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers . it is my opinion  and that  s all it is  that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased  this film would have been good .  

=======================================================================================================

344 ===> even this early in his career  capra was quite accomplished with his camera  work and his timing . this is a thin story   and quite predictable at times   but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately . the first part looks like a cinderella story  though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that   the rich  prince  will lose his fortune .  br    br   nonetheless  because of his good cast and fast pace  it  s easy to get caught up in the clichs . then the movie does become more original  as the married couple have to find a way to make a living . the ending is very predictable but satisfying . i also want to compliment the title  writing very witty and fun .

345 ===> the more i analyze this film  the worse it becomes . first of all  why a motivational speaker  that part was just stupid . i mean  why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker  is alexander stone really that disorganized  first he can  t decide what he wants to do to control the world  so he looks to the bible for ideas . many of these ideas  i might add  really have no reliability  for example  the part of the  the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror  could have already happened . it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something .  and gillen lane  s family  they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water  i might add that since casper van dien  gillen lane is only in his twenties  or that  s the impression that i had  and has a ten year child  he had his child during high school . yeah  there goes tbn  s family values . also  why did this film have to be so damn propaganda  like  i  ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said . the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated . this film doesn  t do that . the beginnig starts off well  with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy  s omega code . then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of  the two prophets tell him  tell your master that we are here   . dominic  ironsides  replies  he already knows  and points to a small surveillance camera . that part sent chills up my spine . had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film . i  ll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character  as does michael ironsides . but the good guys are horrible . i  ve already went on about lane  s family  br    br   . now that i  m over the acting  i  ll get on to plot . this is obviously a baptist film  since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf . the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle  as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well  done . also another diatribe against the vatican  their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded  since gillen explains to the pope that it  s not the end of the world  but the beginning of a new one also  the vatican  or israelis  says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world . whoever it was  they wouldn  t just secede  they  d send over commandoes and kill them . this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying  we  re not going to talk to you any more   . come on  i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor . mediocre in short .

346 ===> monstervision was a show i grew up with . from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one  the only  joe bob briggs . the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years  and provided some of the best drive  in memories to ever come outside of the drive  in .  br    br   without a doubt  the best late night television ever . if you didn  t stay up  you were missing out .  br    br   i know john bloom and joe bob live on  but i want them back where they belong . . . monstervision  question . . . did anyone else sit through all  hours of  the swarm   q   br    br   long live monstervision   

=======================================================================================================

347 ===> yes i admit i cried during this movie . it was so incredibly disappointing  that i couldn  t help myself but cry . tbn  trinity broadcasting network  has done it again . first with having the million dollar man  ex  professional wrestler  on their program  and now this .  br    br   the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies . it was quite amusing  yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate . the movie follows what is known as  the bible code  rather than following actual biblical scripture . this film is extremely poorly made from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting . its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie . it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie .  br    br   i highly recommend you do not watch this movie  even if your life depended on it .  

=======================================================================================================

348 ===> i  ll tell you a tale of the summer of     . a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie  and it was a who  s who of the top canadian bands of the age . we got there about  am  waited in line most of the morning  and when the doors opened at  am  we were among the first inside the gates . we then waited and waited in the hot sun  slowly broiling but we didn  t care  because the headliners were among our favourites . at one point  early in the afternoon  i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier . i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t  shirt . this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day . there  s nothing reasonable  nor taste  determined  nor really anything except their fandom . snotty of me  isn  t it  so  i  in my hatred of the band  have denied myself the delight that is whale music .  br    br   desmond howl had it all . it  s hard to say what he  s lost  since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains  the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking  . the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams  phantoms  and his own past  until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in . . . and  trite as it sounds  breaks him out .  br    br   canadian cinema suffers from several problems . generally  a lack of money  as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help  as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian  leads to lower production values than american or british films  and most people don  t like to watch anything that sounds or looks like  well  not like an american film . next  canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story  and tell it well . third  they seem to think that gratuitous nudity  often full  frontal  makes something artistic . i  m sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies  especially late at night on the cbc  knows exactly what i  m talking about . it  s almost like a  don  t do this  handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film  makers threw it out a long time ago .  br    br   in the   s and   s  however  some films  such as bruce mcdonald  s work and the brilliant c . r . a . z . y .  have broken this mold  and managed to maintain what makes them canadian  while holding onto watchable production values and great stories . whale music is such a film  on the surface . deeper than just its canadian  isms  it  s a deeply moving story of a man who  s lost his grip  through grief and excess  who is redeemed by music then by love . and that redeems even the rheostatics .    

=======================================================================================================

349 ===> quite honestly  the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time . during the first   minutes i sat stunned in my seat  trying to decide if i should demand a refund . but since i hadn  t paid to see it in the first place  passes   i figured i might as well stay . and i didn  t think it could possibly get any worse .  br    br   it did . i will quickly run through the low points  includes some spoilers   the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane  a motivational speaker with two phds . the characterization was inconsistent for example  lane  despite his credentials  is a complete nitwit . then there  s the lame  o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code . also  terrible  action  sequences lane escapes from tough situations without explanation  and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger  it turns out to be a dream sequence  that  s cute for grammar school writing assignments  but it  s an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture . the pacing was bad after a long opener  the first third of the movie changes scenes every   seconds . later  the pacing improves  but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around . and as someone else mentioned  years pass yet no one  not even lane  s young daughter  ages . that was disconcerting .  br    br   there are a few good things  though . the quality of the film  e . g . lack of graininess  is high and very attractive . the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism . also  there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god  finally  to help him  this proved to be quite exhilarating  even to me  someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior . but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie . unfortunately  it was followed by major incomprehensibility .  br    br   the characters  dialogue  direction and acting were all poorly done . michael ironside had nothing to do  and michael york was just weird . i think the producers wanted to do too much if the plot had been tighter and more focused  and the characterization more fleshed out  the film would have been far better .  br    br   in a nutshell  the omega code disappoints . definitely do not pay to see this . i give it  out of ten stars .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

350 ===> i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie . for some reason it clicked on all my levels  tensions in a family  loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with . it didn  t hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire  cyndy preston  . i also bought the sound track to this movie  very hard to get  . loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv  

=======================================================================================================

351 ===> the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency . there was a bit  but precious little  of good acting  primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg  who only appeared once and had no lines . otherwise the acting was decidedly bad . the plot line was rather weak  and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation . certainly not one of the year  s best .  

=======================================================================================================

352 ===> my first exposure to  whale music  was the rheostatics album of the same name  that i bought around     . i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album  which remains in a prominent place in my collection  was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington  s book .  br    br   i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it  an amazing read  i have since re  read the book numerous times  each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music .  br    br   i found the film in      on video . i haven  t had a lot of good experiences with canadian film  but this one worked for me . the role of claire could have been cast differently  but overall i think that paul quarrington  s vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen .  br    br   maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius . the movie deals with family relationships  love  and finding someone who understands . i would strongly recommend  whale music  to not only music fans  but anyone who has ever lost something or someone  and tried to find their way back to the world .  

=======================================================================================================

353 ===>   br    br   i would highly recommend seeing this movie . after viewing it  you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie ever saying  at least it wasn  t the omega code .   br    br   forget my money  i want my time back   

=======================================================================================================

354 ===> this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist  and am i glad he did  the blend of british humor  should i say  humour   and the reality of a lost  middle  aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot . add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot  those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received   and it is a truly hilarious  yet touching film . i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights  maybe it  s just my mendocino county blood  but the brits definitely got this one right         

=======================================================================================================

355 ===> someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo  gritty look is somehow seen as  realistic  by some people .  br    br   i didn  t see anything realistic about the characters  although the actors did their best with really bad parts  or the situations . instead  i saw a forced  self  conscious effort at being  edgy    gritty  and  down and dirty  .  br    br   sadly  it takes a lot more than hand  holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way .  br    br   it  s a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies  with bad cinematography  non  existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as  art  .  br    br   it  s little wonder that films like  in the bedroom  or  about schmidt  get such raves . i found them to be meandering and very average  but compared to the current slew of independent clones like  raising victor vargas  they are outright brilliant and inspired .  br    br   a few years ago seeing an  independent  film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care  and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets  nowadays  it means that chances are you  ll get yet another by  the  numbers  let  s  shake  the  camera  around  for  two  hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors . and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived .  br    br   is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies  not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them .  

=======================================================================================================

356 ===> a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother   saving grace  seems cut from the same cloth as a half  dozen other british comedies over the past two years . . . underdog is faced with adversity  finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him  herself in the process .  br    br   widowed and thus broke  grace is a master gardener  and is enlisted to help her friend  employee matthew grow his pot plant . he  s been doing it all wrong  so grace helps him out . they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot  which they can both benefit from . he enjoys smoking  she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage .  br    br   highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise  dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in  saturday night fever  and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb .  br    br   blethyn is always watchable  and you can  t say that about a lot of people . . well  i can  t  anyway . ferguson is very good  and tcheky karyo  who i liked in  la femme nikita   is memorable .  br    br   not profoundly moving or insightful  but immensely entertaining  and at a brisk   minutes  feels like a walk with friends .     .  

=======================================================================================================

357 ===> one of the worst films i have ever seen . how to define  worst   i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again . somehow  one  hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans  mary kay saleswomen  las vegas  gays  fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy  sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed . how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be  the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one  is beyond me . the worst part of this mess  and that takes some work  is the mangled script in      elvis  words and songs that he would speak  perform in the      s are quoted  worst special effect  that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis  grave  potentially the most photographed  recognizable grave in the world  resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere . potentially  this film  s biggest audience would be elvis fans . however  the rampant stupidity  nixon gave elvis a dea badge  not fbi credentials . . . and i could go on and on  actually undercuts that conventional wisdom . ugh . i used the word  wisdom  to describe this stupid movie . this is truly a horrible  horrible film .  

=======================================================================================================

358 ===> charming doesn  t even begin to describe  saving grace  it  s absolutely irresistible  anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high  haha  .  br    br   grace trevethyn  brenda blethyn  has just lost her husband  but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse . her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts . faced with losing everything  she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash . . . fast  she gets an idea when her gardener  matthew  craig ferguson  asks the town  famous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing . grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana  so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of top  quality weed  and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts .  br    br   the most notable quality about  saving grace  is its likability . every character is extremely sympathetic  and  save for the first   or so minutes  the film is non  stop good cheer . everyone wants a happy ending for everyone  even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities .  br    br   the acting is top  notch . brenda blethyn is one of britain  s finest actresses  and here is why . she turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual . she  s a nice lady  but she  s not stupid . craig ferguson is equally amiable as matthew . he  s a deadbeat loser  but he  s so likable that it doesn  t matter . the rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well  but special mention has to go to tcheky karyo . the french actor always has a aura of menace about him  and that suits him well  but he also has great comedy skills .  br    br   nigel cole finds the perfect tone for  saving grace .  it  s all about the charm . one of the problems i have with british humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film . not so here . the film is thoroughly likable and always amusing . that  s not to say that  saving grace  is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling . while this movie is not an out and out comedy  it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical .  br    br   if there  s any problem with the film  it  s that the climax is a little confusing . the questions are answered though  and the ending boasts an unexpected twist .  br    br   see  saving grace   especially when you  re having a bad day .  

=======================================================================================================

359 ===> darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman  with odd ties to elvis presley  running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada . . . and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own . kim basinger  a still  attractive actress of considerable merit  likes to pick quirky movies to play in  but this dreadful screenplay  by mitchell ganem and adam  michael garber  hasn  t an iota of good humor . the stereotypes and low  ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy  but even on a shambling  shameful level  the picture is crude and sloppy . if you do watch  see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac  hands always in the same position and a non  plussed look on her face . hopefully both she and elvis were well paid . no stars from   

=======================================================================================================

360 ===> saving grace is a feel good movie with it  s heart in the right place . grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts . she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana . she  s living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors . there  s only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it  s user . it  s obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff . the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny . it  s precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick  and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable .  

=======================================================================================================

361 ===> elvis has left the building and he  s lucky because he didn  t have to watch this unfunny stinker . scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing . filled with unfunny deaths  trite gay characteratures  and hack jokes  this film is more desperate than amusing . this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement . let us remember her the way she was  talented  and not what she  s become . david leisure  the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here . zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn . the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the king . the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen . she really looks like her and is actually pretty good . the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo . the cameo isn  t all that funny  but at least its not painful . one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

362 ===> for muslim women in western africa  married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard . the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour  but equally  they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal  an attitude which of course enables it to continue . fortunately  the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all  and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children . what is notable  apart from the uplifting central story  is how  in spite of their informality  the courts are actually pragmatically progressive  if a case is actually bought . the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life  style  which  aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases  seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america . and while i concede that this comment may betray naivet on my part  this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin  english they speak . overall  this is a terrific little film  and much more fun to watch than you might imagine .  

=======================================================================================================

363 ===> i notice that the previous reviewer  who appears to be still at school  gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn  t seen the far superior     bbc adaptation of this classic novel . the major problem i had with this       version was the casting of anthony way as tom long . anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini  series  the choir  . i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in  the choir  . unfortunately the small boy who appeared in  the choir  had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time  tom  s midnight garden  was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom . it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom  as played by anthony  would befriend the far younger hatty . in the     bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable . for a     movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the     tv effects . the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic . as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the     bbc version fetches well over    .   second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under   .    need i say more   

=======================================================================================================

364 ===> i saw saving grace right after it came out on video . since then it  s become one of my favorites  the plot isn  t particularly complex but it doesn  t take away from the entertainment . it  s chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it . the characters are what makes the movie so good . they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor  the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind . superb acting was done by all  particularly brenda blythen . she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments . if you  re looking for a good comedy i  d definately recommend this movie   

=======================================================================================================

365 ===> a difficult film to categorize . i was never giving it     concentration  consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn  t say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters  what their roles were . nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines  scenes were all in the style of one of his shows  not acted out .  br    br   this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show  with a largely insignificant sub plot going on  which just seemed to get in the way . however as any irwin show is always worth a watch  this film is well worth a look too  but not on christmas day . talking of which  i  ve better things to do too than be on here .  br    br   a high      

=======================================================================================================

366 ===> saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon  when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun . i mean  the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness  it was the first movie i watched with this theme  drugs  marijuana  that is not really criticizing it  only making jokes about it . grace trevethyn is a widow  who lives in a small town in u . k . and has many financial problems because of her dead husband  who committed suicide since he was full of debts . the problem is that grace  who imagined to have some money saved for her  discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband  s pounds in debts to not lose all of her things  specially her house that she loves so much . she never worked before  and is in a tragic situation until matthew  her gardener who is very found of smoking pot  decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale .  

=======================================================================================================

367 ===> gday mates  just watched croc hunter the movie . it was alright but the show seems more real . this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters . a few things steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles . yeeeowch  for reals you know that hurts . and cant they jump up high  hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff . there was two major cleavage shots in this movie . when terry find that baby joey she goes like  we have to nurture them  just like a baby  . woah  i thought she was gonna up  breast feed that kid . that woulda made it pg    though . while on terry  did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry  s knowledge on ritual mating . she knows her sex stuffs . movie takes place in queensland  austrailia . i want a koala  dingo  and joey   br    br   steve  s dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie . albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite  wielding hottie .  br    br   oh and if anyone else watches this  try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc . he was eating her sheep   i would be mad too   

=======================================================================================================

368 ===> it  s a bit easy . that  s about it .  br    br   the graphics are clean and realistic  except for the fact that some of the fences are  d  but that  s forgiveable . the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n   games . the sounds are magnificant . everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic .  br    br   the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times  but it  s the same for every platform game  like banjo  kazooie and donkey kong   .  br    br   i got this game as a christmas present in      and since then  i have dutifully gotten    stars over   times .  

=======================================================================================================

369 ===> ok  first of all  steve irwin  rest in peace . you were loved by many fans . now . . . this movie wasn  t a movie at all . it was  the crocodile hunter  tv program with bad acting  bad scripts  and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals . he was entertaining as an animal seeker  specialist . millions will miss him . but the whole movie idea was a big mistake . the plot was so broken  it was almost non  existent . casting was horrible . the acting wasn  t even worth elementary school  level actors . the direction must be faulted as well . if you can  t get a half  way decent performance out of your actors  no matter how bad the script is  you must not be that good in the first place . i could have written a better script . i wish i had never been to see this movie . of course  i watched it for      .   for me    .   for my son .  while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action . my son  who is not so discriminating  liked the movie alright  but he still has never asked to see it again . if you want fond memories of steve irwin  buy his series on dvd . avoid this movie like the plague . if i were steve  i know i wouldn  t want to be remembered for this movie . respect him avoid this movie   

=======================================================================================================

370 ===> this movie had an interesting cast  it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job . im glad we have b grade movies like this one  the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it  you don  t need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot . i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn  t close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station . arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation . this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future .

371 ===> i never was an avid viewer of  crocodile hunter   but did occasionally see an episode  or a bit of an episode  and when the news spread about steve irwin  s death from a stingray attack in      it certainly caught my attention . this movie  with steve and his wife  terri  playing themselves  but in a fictional story  was released in      but i didn  t hear of it until several years later  and even after that  it took me a while to get around to seeing it . well  now i have seen it  and after looking here first  more than once   and seeing its rating  i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be  though it could have been a bit better . apparently  it  s supposed to be a comedy  so a major problem with it is that it isn  t very funny at all .  br    br   a u . s . satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia  where it is swallowed by a crocodile  while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt  and are unaware of what  s inside it  two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon  the agents are assisted by jo buckley  and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them  on steve and terri  s mission  they face other types of dangerous wildlife  not just the crocodile  and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it  when steve sees the cia agents after them  he mistakes them for poachers   br    br   not only did i not laugh once while watching this film  the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents . apart from that  i don  t think i found anything even mildly amusing . it  s also a bit of an incoherent mess  switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters  and it seems like clips from  crocodile hunter  and clips from an action thriller  or something like that  put together for some reason . also added to that mix are the ranch scenes  which also seem to be from somewhere else  and as funny as brozzie drewitt  played by magda szubanski  is supposed to be  she  s not . at one point  we see her farting  so we have a fart joke  a major clich in modern comedy  are they so hard to resist   i also found the typical  crocodile hunter  scenes  with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers  to be tedious  but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn  t help .  br    br   steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist  and is sadly missed by them  while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him . no matter which side you  re on   the crocodile hunter collision course  is not a well crafted movie . i  m sure it does help if you  re a big steve irwin fan  but even if you are  there  s no guarantee that you would like this movie  as some fans clearly haven  t been impressed . in fact  it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have  so maybe it won  t help . like i said  there  s no guarantee . i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show  this movie was unnecessary . the attempt to combine what is usually seen in  crocodile hunter  with a fictional story unfortunately failed  and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes

372 ===> one of the funnest mario  s i  ve ever played . the levels are creative  there are fluid controls  and good graphics for its time . there  s also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight . sometimes the levels get frustrating  and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still  need to get more accomplished to fight a boss  it can be annoying . another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time  it can be a pain in certain situations . if your a big time mario fan this ones for you . even if your not a huge fan of him  i  d still recommend this one . its a big game  and getting what you need can take a while  but it  s very satisfying . good for playing in short bursts of time . it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine

373 ===> i saw this film yesterday . . i rented the dvd from blockbuster . . in fact  i know one of the actresses from the film . . i won  t say who . .   that  s kept under wraps . .  but i must admit  it wasn  t as good as i thought it would be . . tom savini  hats down to this guy . . but it  s a shame he wasn  t in the film for long . . what lacks the film is the idea  the script  sound  etc . . it may look like a good movie . . but it wasn  t that entertaining . .  br    br   well  i  m glad my sister paid    for renting  dvd  s from blockbuster . . i chose this one . . and i was disappointed . anyway  thumbs down for me . .  not my cup of tea   out of

374 ===> yes  that  s right  it is . i firmly believe that the n   and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made . it was amazing the first time i saw it  with its huge environments and colorful characters  and its amazing now . the play control is perfect  the graphics are beautiful  and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there . a must have for any n   owner  and a reason to get an n   for everyone else .

375 ===> when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichs that you can guarantee will follow .  br    br     the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local . dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens . what  who  how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst .   the van will break down .   whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about .   they will find a house inhabited by a madman  he will capture them .   the house will have a phone but it will not work  it will be disturbingly decorated  there will be flickering neon light  spiders and maggots .   the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won  t start  here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor  .   the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap  weak scare and will then be killed properly .   only a girl will be left alive from the group .   there will be an unnecessary twist at the end .  br    br   add to these elements naked sirens  who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately  that seduce and kill the teens  throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie .  br    br   i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film  darkhunters  which is one of the worst films i have ever seen . at times the cinematography is very good  the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies . i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity . however  the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film  it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again  but amongst the dvd extras .  br    br   if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director  s commentary it is beyond belief . there is more to say about this than the film itself . one staggering part of the commentary is the director  s claim that the film is clich leaden because it was a preconceived idea . he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichs and openly he wonders if  people will get it  .  br    br   i  m afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichs within them then it is not wittily scripted enough  acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work . if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question  what was the point   this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies  any attempt to do something clever or different haven  t worked .  br    br   the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats . they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use . however  the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary . there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style  roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant .  br    br   the best moment is reserved for robert  s comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film . those who didn  t like it are generalised as  geeks  and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that . i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn  t singled out for ridicule . the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers  complete with  hilarious  accents to imply that people from norway wouldn  t know a good film simply because of where they are born . as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting  they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant .  br    br   the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast . robert  s swears blind in voice over   i didn  t want to make a film that was like baywatch  as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground . there is also a simpering  self  indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert  s says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is  the best british film in years  . i don  t know who he is trying to convince . at one point in the commentary track robert  s says jokingly  i can see people sitting at home saying  this isn  t amazing  its sht  he isn  t wrong .

376 ===> mario is invited to princess peach  s castle for cake . when mario gets there  he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her  mario must save the day again . unlike the   d games  mario can explore anything he wants to . he can just roam around  climb trees trying to look for   ups  find secrets in levels  and more . you can spend four hours in one level . no time limits . there are   worlds  with a number of stages  and there are star doors  which you need a certain number of stars to get into . once you get in these star doors  you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage . to get to certain worlds  you need a number of stars to get in . you enter the world by going through a painting . there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay  i don  t see how anyone could dislike this game . it  s great . this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n   would have a good life . every  d plat  form game we know of has something in common with sm   . banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used . super mario   is one of the greatest games in the history of  d games .   out of   . if you have an n    buy this game . it  s hard to find used  because no one  s selling this baby for  bucks at the pawn shop . a perfect   .

377 ===> booted out of heaven  a gang of horny naked female angels  with big plastic fangs  have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by . it  s not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes an independent low budget horror made in the uk  forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting  effects and direction i have seen in a long time .  br    br   director johannes roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled  shock  moments  but for the most part the film is technically amateurish . throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom savini and shaun hutson  and you have one real bad movie on your hands .  br    br   some fun may be derived from the film  s sheer shoddiness  and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour  but most will find this a chore to sit through .  

=======================================================================================================

378 ===> this is an ok adaptation  but not as good as the tv version . the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley  particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version . gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again  i preferred kate beckinsale  s emma . there are excellent support performances from toni collette  juliet stephenson and sophy thompson .  br    br   the script is often played too much for laughs  the book is a comedy  but there are too many set  piece gags here  and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent .  br    br   my biggest criticism is the scenery . it is far too lush . england has never been like this . it looks like a chocolate box . only americans would make it like this .  br    br   despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more .  

=======================================================================================================

379 ===> note to horror fans the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted   minutes of your life on a movie that  s so worthless it  s insulting .  br    br   i watched this because  br    br   the premise sounded slightly promising it  s not . it  s just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low  budget slasher films that weren  t good either .  br    br   the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful it  s not . it  s so not . the amateur cinematography makes sure the  fallen angels  are about as sexy as the average homeless person .  br    br   the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre he  s the king of low  budget special effects and lower  budget acting . come to think of it  savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie . it  s not that he  s bad  but he  s almost always in bad movies . his only good role was in from dusk till dawn  and he  s been milking that at horror conventions ever since .  br    br   but let  s focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie .  br    br   everything else is a negative . obviously the writer is allergic to originality . the script is terrible . that  s all a given after the first   minutes . but the clueless pacing the way the director treats  plot  and  characterization  as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving  walking  and nature sequences  no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution  show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general .  br    br   this is another good example of the number  one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad if it  s written and directed by the same person  expect garbage .

380 ===> if you have any clue about jane austens production  youll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage  marriage and marriage  in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring  but i like austens characters  because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma . the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow  shes very good in her leading role . also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie dont seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious .  

=======================================================================================================

381 ===> the plot was very thin  although the idea of naked  sexy  man eating sirens is a good one .  br    br   the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie  splatter  lesbian mouth licking shots in between .  br    br   the characters were wooden and one dimensional .  br    br   the ending made no sense .  br    br   considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it  you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects . some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them .  br    br   brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush  naturally  and of course the lesbian moments . i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the  shower scene   br    br   the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely .  br    br   if i had been watching this alone and aged    i would have really enjoyed it for about   minutes  with  hand of the remote control   then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza . . .

382 ===>   emma  was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid  nineties  and it was recently shown on british television  doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with  pride and prejudice  two years ago . we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic  becoming jane   and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels . these include  northanger abbey   the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously  so the cycle should now be complete . no doubt  however  there will be more to come in the near future .  there is  after all  her juvenile  love and freindship   sic   the short novella  lady susan   and someone  somewhere  has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments  the watsons  and  sanditon  . then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers  .  br    br   the main character is emma woodhouse  a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england .  not  as some reviewers have assumed  victorian england  austen died before queen victoria was even born  . emma is  financially  considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price  and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband . instead  her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends . she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer  robert martin  believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton . this scheme goes disastrously wrong  however  as elton has no interest in harriet  but has fallen in love with emma herself . the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards  with good reason  as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself . this being a jane austen plot  emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems  and she too finds herself falling in love  leading to further complications .  br    br   emma always insists that she will not marry without affection  and when she does find a partner  the handsome mr knightley  we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage . it does not  however  seem likely to be a very passionate one  unlike  say  that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy  . knightley  who is sixteen years older than emma  she is    he     and related to her by marriage  is more like a father  figure than a lover . much more of a father  figure  in fact  than her actual father  a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather . when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates  it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners .  his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature  nineteenth  century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry  . both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well  but this is not really one of the great screen romances .  br    br   of the other characters  i liked juliet stephenson  s vulgar mrs elton and toni collette  s harriet . i know that in the novel harriet was a nave young teenager  whereas here she is more like the character collette played in  muriel  s wedding   a gauche  slightly overweight twentysomething  fretting about her chances of finding a man . nevertheless  i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen  s themes .  br    br    emma  is one of austen  s more light  hearted works  without the darker overtones of  mansfield park  or even  pride and prejudice   and this is reflected on screen . we see a world of beauty and grace  full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners . apart from the ruffianly gypsies  who make a very brief appearance  the only  poor  people we see are mrs bates and her daughter  and  as they live in the sort of picturesque rose  strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over          we can be sure that their poverty is relative  not absolute . in emma  s world  poverty is defined as not having your own stately home . this is  of course  not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth  century life  but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen  sink realist . sophisticated romantic comedy  combined with a keen eye for analysing human character  was more in her line .  br    br   i would not rate this film quite as highly as the      sense and sensibility  or the recent  pride and prejudice   it tends to drag a bit in the middle  although it has a strong beginning and strong ending  but it is  in the main  a highly enjoyable austen adaptation .

383 ===> from the start this film was awful  why was it that bad   if it isn  t the naked women  not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of colgate whitening   then it  s the  crazy  old guy at the gas station  who isn  t so much crazy  but more  i  m not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods    then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis . . . . apparently  without touching you . . . and this is according to the opening scene . . . . they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck  which i assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some tcp to clear it right up . then you have sophie holland who plays ally  i have never seen such baaaaaad acting  she is more of a  me me me  if i  m not having fun no  one else is  and i don  t wanna do this so i won  t  and i  m the meanest cow on the planet  i  m sarcastic  petty and if i don  t get things my way i will sulk    kind of person . . . . reminds me more of a  yr old girl  s attitude . i don  t think it  s even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch  or how low  budget the film actually was that when judd was hacking at the  locked  door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side   this film is completely laughable  if it were a spoof then it would have been successful . . . only just though  but  as a horror film is was just plain wrong    i can  t even being to describe everything that went t  ts up in this movie i would run out of room  although it was funny to watch andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom savini  s character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision   it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor  which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow  so is it any wonder they don  t get away with it   and how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened  no pain  no weakening from blood loss  nothing   but the silliest part is when all of a sudden  and i mean that literally  it  s one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs  and then lo and behold  shaun hutson picks her up . . . of course not without a line to promote his books    altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors  but suddenly  and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why . . . she  s evil herself and lures hutson to his death  then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can  even after his  dazzling  performance on why no  one should ever venture there for whatever reason . . . cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while crazy pours petrol everywhere . . . . and here endeth the film . . . . finally  my conclusion . . . . if you hadn  t already guessed by now . . . . absolute rubbish  there was no proper thought went into it at all  whoever was aiming the camera needed firing . . . and come to think of it so did    of the cast  if the right director  actors  and budget got behind this it could have been decent . but  once again  low  budget english horror films but the rest of the genre  the country  and the english film  making industry to shame    and i  m english so i  m allowed to say that   in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first      mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area . all i kept thinking throughout this was  jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this  its absolute cow  s testicles    but i can  t turn a film off after i  ve started watching it unfortunately . i had to watch from dusk til dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom savini does have it in him to act well  if there was an option for     then believe me i woulda chose that  cuz this film isn  t even worth the one point i did give it   br    br   but this is just my opinion  watch it and decide for yourself .

384 ===> i  m a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature  length film  a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini  series  it was really great . gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well  intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr . knightly with his poise and nobility . i wasn  t thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn  t feel it spoiled the movie at all . like i said  as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren  t but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well . i  ve seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one

385 ===> though frank loesser  s songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer  they  re bollixed by joseph l . mankiewicz  lethargic staging and uninspired presentation   when it  s over it barely feels like you  ve watched a musical . mankiewicz doesn  t seem to know how to present loesser  s challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example  one of the best numbers  the showstopping adelaide  s lament   concludes by having adelaide  vivian blaine  belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and stubby kaye  s faux  spiritual sit down  you  re rockin  the boat  has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there . mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue  adapted from abe burrows  stage book  has none of the wit that his films like all about eve  have . part of the blame has to go to the leads  just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he  s in a musical  frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential  the songs are not tailored to his style  and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might . only blaine  as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide  commands our attention like a broadway pro should . the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets .

386 ===> well  i guess i  m emotionally attached to this movie since it  s the first one i went to see more than   times in the cinema . . . helping me through my master  s thesis  or rather keeping me from working on it   br    br   but on watching it again several years  and many many movies  later  what a well  crafted little gem this is  i  ve never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance  and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley  where does one meet such a man       sigh    sophie thompson  s turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest  oh  napkins  sorry   and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either  toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet  and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming  and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect  impossible  couple   br    br   of course the sets and costumes  and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood  almost hobbiton  like atmosphere of the movie  although as far as cinematography and art decoration go  it  s almost a case of visual overload . very very pretty  but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period . but the good thing is  the movie doesn  t take itself too seriously  and there is plenty of fun  and some pretty cool editing  that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england mode .  br    br   my particular favorite is the ball scene  some beautiful acting and directing here  and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully . pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long  cut two shots  i can think of exactly which ones   and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie .  br    br   gosh  i just realize  by reading the imdb listings  that i  ve seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him  seems he  s got a lot more going for him  as an actor  than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob  hmm  guess i need to pay my video store a visit . . .  br    br   lovely movie . my favorite jane austen adaptation so far  though perhaps ang lee  s sense and sensibility is  strictly speaking  the better movie  this one is closest to my heart  and i  ve certainly seen it many more times  watch it if you can  and don  t be too hard on its little imperfections .  br    br

387 ===> this film actually works from a fairly original idea  i  ve never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway . however  the way that it executes this idea isn  t original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that  for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest . the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks  nutcases  zombies etc but really  the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme . many films of this ilk don  t have a single good idea  and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one . the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they  re beautiful women that the characters lust for  rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from . this is good up until a point but it soon gets boring  and the almost complete lack of any back  story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the  horror trash  category .  br    br   it  s been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location  and in spite of films like the blair witch project it still makes for an excellent horror setting . this is one of the film  s major assets  as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown  the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn  t ever seem to have much up its sleeve . the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination  and the fact that all the characters are clichd in the extreme doesn  t help  as you  re more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away . the cast is made up of kids mainly  but there is a role here for tom savini who unfortunately doesn  t get to have fun in the special effects department . the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves . the naked ladies tend to look great  and if it wasn  t for them  this film would get very boring very quickly . there  s nothing to recommend this film for really but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks  you might find some enjoyment here .

388 ===> jane austen would definitely approve of this one   br    br   gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma . she is funny without being excessively silly  yet elegant . she puts on a very convincing british accent  not being british myself  maybe i  m not the best judge  but she fooled me . . . she was also excellent in  sliding doors  . . . i sometimes forget she  s american    .  br    br   also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law  emma thompson  s sister and mother  as the bates women . they nearly steal the show . . . and ms . law doesn  t even have any lines   br    br   highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

389 ===> the plot was predictable  and fighting with guns gets old  but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low iq and don  t really care about real movies . i would endulge in true art movies  like  clerks    something about mary    el mariachi   or  la taqueria  .  

=======================================================================================================

390 ===> this is one of the best films i have seen in years  i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan  but she is excellent as emma woodhouse . alan cumming is superb as reverand elton  and emma thompson  s sister  sophie  is hysterical as miss bates . and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr . knightley what a gentleman  whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma . i think that is what separates it from so many others   it  s classy .  br    br   if you  re looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family  or looking for a romance for yourself  look no further . emma is that movie . with a beautiful setting  wonderful costumes  and an outstanding cast  have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam    emma is a perfect ten

391 ===> i picked this one up because the music was done by hans zimmer  a customer of metasonix modular synths  made by someone dear to me  . the jacket art says  the     version  .  br    br   i give it one point for a strong female  one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster  s light blue eyes  of which there are plenty of shots of .  br    br   it was fun seeing david maccullum casually swimming  the pool has a plexiglass viewing window    while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in greece .  br    br   the sets were marginally impressive  that is  rich people  s houses in l . a . and mendanassos  sp    where the castle was . i found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around . the wind wasn  t fierce enough to be believable to me . i kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty . . . etc . and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding . i stumbled over things like why did she light a fire  blow out the match  then throw the match into the fire   dumb stuff like that . it was clunky at best . oh well . robert morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it .

392 ===> a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association  wla  of kumba  in southwest cameroon  in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence . in this muslim culture  where men have always been sovereign over women  according to sharia law  one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children . after   years of failed efforts  leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins  and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories .  br    br   the leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa  a state prosecutor  and beatrice ntuba  a senior judge  court president  . both play themselves in this film  which may contain footage shot spontaneously  though i imagine much of it  if not all  consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera . four cases are reviewed  and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film .  br    br   two cases involve repeated wife beating  with forcible sex in one case another involves forced sex upon a   year old girl and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child  age   by an aunt . one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce . we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials . the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children . the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and  or fines the divorce is granted .  br    br   the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender  neutral when it comes to enforcing the law . also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties  including those found guilty  are treated . this is a highly important and well made film .  of interest is the fact that one of the directors  ms . longinotto  also co  directed the     film  divorce  iranian style  which dealt with related themes in tehran .   in broken english with english subtitles  . my grade b      

=======================================================================================================

393 ===> disappointing musical version of margaret landon  s  anna and the king of siam   itself filmed in     with irene dunne and rex harrison  has deborah kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from england to siam in     to accept job as tutor to the king  s many children   and perhaps teach the royal one a thing or two in the process  stagy picture begins well  but quickly loses energy and focus . yul brynner  reprising his stage triumph as the king  is a commanding presence  but is used   per the concocted story   as a buffoon . kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better  despite having to lip  synch to marni nixon  s vocals . perhaps having already played this part to death  brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast . second  half  with anna and the moppets staging a musical version of  uncle tom  s cabin  is quite ridiculous  and the rodgers and hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering . brynner won a best actor oscar  but it is feisty kerr who keeps this bauble above water . overlong  heavy  and  old  fashioned  in the worst sense of the term .  from

394 ===> make the world go away . get it off my shoulder . say the things you used to say  and make the world go away .  br    br   well  dave  david hewlett  and andrew  andrew miller  were in a pickle  one for embezzlement  and the other for kissing a child . neither was guilty  but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down  they ended up in  well  nothing . the whole world  except for their house went away .  br    br   it is kind of weird  but funny  too . just what would you do if you were all alone in the world  the two friends just enjoy each other  s company  and do what they want . but  that gets old fast  it seems .  br    br   then they start to improve their live by hating away memories . the sound effects during this were great .  br    br   things really got weird at the end . this film was the product of a great imagination  and written and directed by vincenzo natali  with help from the two stars . it just has to be seen .  

=======================================================================================================

395 ===> this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with . but first the movie  it  s a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn  t have the flair of the original film version with william holden . what they couldn  t afford to hire more than twelve people as extras  why move the movie up to      so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests  why not     and give her a line about the civil rights movement   br    br   as for the casting  some hits some misses . jay o . sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin . brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes . he  s believable as an ex  bmoc jock but he doesn  t have the raw sensuality of william holden . i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him  pardon the pun  . gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played . she didn  t project the innocence or ignorance that the character required . maybe it  s because she and brolin were about  years older than the characters should be . but then again holden was ten years too old . bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen can  t seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from  the taming of the shrew  .  br    br   as for mr . inge  s play  i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue .  the twilight zone  i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode   spur of the moment  where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland  because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter .  

=======================================================================================================

396 ===> the only word that sums up this movie is quirky . it  s a light  hearted romp through an existential concept . bouncy  in more way than one  and a bit nutty . i wouldn  t exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn  t seem quite as memorable as the director  s first movie  cube  but it  s a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning . the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that  s how it was to be written . done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension . a little like  the matrix  meets  head  meets  human nature  .  br    br    .  out of ten  

=======================================================================================================

397 ===> william cooke and paul talbot share director  writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines . feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth . . . and a scroungy town tramp named ralph  gunnar hansen . . . of leatherface fame  wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire .  br    br   one tale is the old retread of  the hook   two teens on lover  s lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand . another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed . they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great st . as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off . one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas  who can  t wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus . the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies .  br    br   without a big budget for special effects  campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse . a bit corny  but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale . the acting is understandably not award worthy . cast members include tres holton  courtney ballard  h . ray york  johnny tamblyn  walter kaufmann  kevin draine  david avin and paul kaufmann .  

=======================================================================================================

398 ===> i work at a movie store  and as such  i am always on the look  out for an excellent movie . i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section  and i  ve been trying to support my country  s movie industry . i was in for a surprise . the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships . . . without working that hard . it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters  as well as some funny exchanges   we can  t be dead  we have cable    . what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot  even if you abandon it within the first half an hour .  

=======================================================================================================

399 ===> people tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror  thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer  whose name escapes me at the moment  . whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair  he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never  ending murder spree . it  s not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on  by the way . other low  budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise  like  house     shocker  and  ghost in the machine  . anyway   the first power   a . k . a  pentagram   isn  t a completely terrible effort  but the script overly reverts to clichs and lacks genuine thrills . the film starts off as an okay  albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop  hero lou diamond philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims . he receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium  played by the gorgeous and underrated tracy griffith . she leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him  as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe  thanks to tess  helpful hints  detective logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty  but patrick channing made a pact with satan himself and returns to the rotten streets of california to do some more killing .  the first power  gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit . instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world  that  s what i would do in his position   channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper . he annoyingly calls him  buddy  boy  all the time and possesses the bodies of logan  s friends and colleagues in order to trick him . even though never really boring or poorly realized  it  s a very weak film to endure  mostly because you constantly get the feeling of dj  vu . writer  director robert resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful clich  the killer got sexually abused as a child  and even the players  lines can easily be predicted . as soon as griffith explains she  s able to predict the future  you just know that  somewhere at some point in the film  she  s going to say the ridiculously overused line  i tell people who to live their lives  but my own life is a mess  . yawn . lou diamond philips  performance is adequate enough  but it  s rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of  la bamba  and  stand and deliver  serious as a tough copper . there also are decent supportive roles for mykelti williamson   forrest gump    carmen argenziano   when a stranger calls   and b  movie horror legend david gale   re  animator   appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film .  

=======================================================================================================

400 ===> i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience . the imagination on display  the visual interpretation of the script  the humor is constantly surprising . the two leads are great and really carry the film . my advice would be to not even watch a trailer  just rent the film and watch without expectations . i rented from blockbuster  so it is readily available in brisbane  not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that  s always good  unless it  s just  that was stupid  . i loved this film  you just don  t get to see gem  s like this every day . this should become a cult favorite . give it a try  you may just feel the same way about it as i do .  

=======================================================================================================

401 ===> i jotted down a few notes here on the first power  lou lambada diamond phillips      satanic serial killer yuppie hell  fest . . .  br    br     lou diamond phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison . i only hope that he can find armani prison wear to go off in style with one of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in      designer overcoats  a      designer silk suit  and seeing his       month los angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by mies van der roeh .  br    br     leading lady tracey phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin  flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed  and amazing breasts that are hi  lighted in the  nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to satan . at least back in the      s our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them  though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination . by the final   minutes of the movie all i could think about is what her breasts probably would look like .  br    br     professional psychics living in los angeles can afford   million dollar condos on mullholland drive overlooking los angeles with a view that would make brad pitt decide that he was roughing it . as a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in david lynch  s mullholland dr .  which at least had the good sense to make it  s condo resident a successful movie director . the only professional psychics i have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud .  br    br     i forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful  and his  how  s it going   buddy boy   line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since  thanks for the ride  lady    from creepshow  .  br    br     underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit zippo lighter into them  which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous . and since zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing  the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your      gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous .  br    br     the stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least  and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when released .  br    br     movie satanists always amaze me here is a guy who has tapped into some luciferian bid for power  and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him  he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people  s apartments . speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible  can fly  and is able to put his being inside of other people  s bodies   and yet he obliges star lou diamond phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film  s conclusion  yet does not have the good sense to inhabit arnold schwartzeneggar or apollo creed to ensure that he wins .  br    br   and on and on . . . to be watched in the company of wise  cracking friends while consuming beer . you  ll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

402 ===> a light  hearted comedy  nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing . anything you don  t like  be it a stack of bills  a bad memory  or even hunger can disappear at your wish . they approached this movie very well  and with an enjoyable starring duo  there were only a few things i didn  t like about nothing  and they weren  t even part of the main movie .  br    br   first  the post  credits scene  and yes  there is one   good for a chuckle  but what were they trying to accomplish with that  i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing . instead  we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream . it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion  and wasn  t really necessary  nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame .  br    br   second  the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd  and like others have already said this  it promotes a horror movie that never came . oh well  poor marketing i guess .  br    br   if you see this at your movie rental store  take a look  because nothing is a great movie to watch . if you have a big screen though  you might want to wear shades .  

=======================================================================================================

403 ===> when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie it  s touch and go whether you should revisit it . anyway  i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff kober .  br    br    the first power  is not a very good movie  sad to say . it  s chock full of those cop clichs and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through  along with countless convenient  twists  that help the story run along  . lou diamond phillips is the over  confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across . through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case .  br    br   ahhh  this is trash . but enjoyable as such  especially if you have fond memories of it . it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good . as for any kind of logic here forget it  just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a    s demonic flick . and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here  needless to say he  s not convincing at all but he tries his best and i  ve never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have . as for tracy griffith as the psychic  the less said the better . but kober is pretty good as the killer always liked that actor .  br    br    the first power  may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day  s work and a  brain switch  off  is needed . beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and i  ll definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin . all in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids .  see you around  buddy boy    

=======================================================================================================

404 ===> i chanced upon this movie because i had a free non  new release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly  as the store was getting ready to close for the evening . the plain white cover and title intrigued me . i  m a  relatively speaking   old  lady and my son is a young man of   . i adore movies that are sheer entertainment  such as the sixth sense  interview with a vampire  harry potter and beetlejuice . my son  on the other hand  is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films  such as those directed by bergman or hertzog . we generally hate each other  s movie choices  however  we both watched and loved the movie nothing  it was unlike any movie we  d ever seen before . we  re both cynical  critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them   but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish . it is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the u . s . it would have done very well indeed .  

=======================================================================================================

405 ===> i don  t remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from  what happens to them or where they are going . i realize that hollywood  s greatest pastime is navel  gazing  but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with . for what it  s worth  though  the discussion that followed the showing  under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series  did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics . i disagree .  

=======================================================================================================

406 ===> i just saw this at the toronto film festival  and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again  it is a character  driven film  and andrew and david are more than up to the task . any discussion of the plot might be  br    br   considered spoilers  so i  ll just say that the storyline is clever  the acting is superb  and the effects are amazing . well  filmed and well  paced too . one of the best films i have seen in ages  and very refreshing in this summer of dreary  br    br   movies . it had the audience laughing the whole time . see it if you can .  i particularly liked the  candy bar  candy bar   scene .   

=======================================================================================================

407 ===> rural family drama   with perhaps a nod to  ordinary people    concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap . despite downbeat subject matter  given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain   there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring . unfortunately  the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience . what with robert duvall  glenn close  and wilford brimley in the cast  the movie is nearly a small  scaled reunion of  the natural  . too bad this project didn  t get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping  memorable picture .     from   

=======================================================================================================

408 ===> sitting  typing nothing is the latest  what if   fest offered by vincenzio natali  and starring david hewlitt and andrew miller as two losers . one is having relationship problems  got canned from his job  because of relationship problems  and the police are out to get him  because of his job and his relationship problems  . the other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home  is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her mom to claim she was molested when he doesn  t buy cookies from him . oh yeah  the police are after him too  after the mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest him .  br    br   man  what a day .  br    br   what if you could make all of this disappear  that is the whole premise behind  nothing  . the two fools realize  the cops  the girl scout  the cars  the lawn  the road  everything disappear . there  s nothing but white space  this is an interesting concept i thought . i also looked at the time of this    minutes had gone in the movie  and i still had an hour left in the movie . could the  actors make this work and keep us entertained for   minutes  although the actors try    minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie . but the two actors  whom are life  long friends with each other and the director  have such great repertoire with each other  that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do . there are lots of supernatural elements  but it  s more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing .  

=======================================================================================================

409 ===> this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow . the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again  things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear . was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production   br    br   poor film making aside  the story is vile just sick evil sht if you like rape  murder and self harm this is right up your alley . and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed . i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out . never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty .

410 ===> nothing    outta  stars  another weird premise from the director of the movie  cube  . this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void . there is literally nothing outside of their small two  story house . intriguing to be sure  but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get  go was extremely ill  conceived . there needs to be some humour  certainly . . . and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes  their final  showdown  was definitely a hoot  . . . but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning . after watching the movie i watched the  making of  feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the  sillier  comedic aspects . . . making it look like a completely different  and slightly better  movie . the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together . . . similar in a way to the recent movie  primer .  the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick . they are really quite believable in their more  normal  moments . i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point . . . but it won me over by the end .  and keep watching past the credits for the final scene . . . just don  t ask me to explain it .

411 ===> first of all i love good splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art  but this zero  budget  flick is none of it  the picture  quality is so damned low  the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever       heard  and as for the fx . . . well the super  low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie  what this junk here isn  t  . no concept  a wafer  thin storyline  primitive acting and rare dialog  i think i counted about   sentences in the whole movie  each one repeated about   times . . . same for a lot of film  sequences  may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made     the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother  got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring  performing a show of self  mutilation . so far  so good . . . but for these pseudo  art  idiot  directors  this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense  freshly taken  out bowels are thrown on a naked  bound woman in an earth  hole . . . why   and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody  movie      disturbing  yes   sick  yes   necessary  no  artistically  no      everyone mistaking this cheap gore  show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink floyd  s  the wall  to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way . . . i hope this was your first and last           movie  andrew cobb . . .     and all you gore  heads out there  remember not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically  art  . . .  

=======================================================================================================

412 ===> just saw this at the     vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal . takes place in toronto  where these two losers live in this run  down house in the middle of a freeway system . david hewlett  pin  cube  cypher  and andrew miller  cube  are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away . the acting  dialogue and writing are very good  and the whole film looks great for such a low  budget flick . director  writer vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening  and he seemed so intelligent and down  to  earth . this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets  it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame   

=======================================================================================================

413 ===> i don  t know why this has the fans it does and i don  t know why i have even given it the score i have . this is preposterous . there are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief  let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen . but  this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack  even by italian standards . not a giallo  this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring klaus kinski in one his most blatant  phoned in  performances . i reckon he turned up  did a day  s work and cleared off leaving mr d  amato to get others to fill in . ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough  and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place  long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle . maybe i just wasn  t in the right mood   

=======================================================================================================

414 ===> all i have to say is if you don  t like it then there is something wrong with you . plus jessica is just all kinds of hot      the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell . that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen .  

=======================================================================================================

415 ===> a lot of other reviewers here  including many whose opinions i respect  hold this slice of european sleaze horror in high regard . personally  i didn  t like it at all . its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence . jess franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well . unfortunately  the infamous exploitation filmmaker joe d  amato does not . d  amato  s most well known films are infamous for their high gross  out quotient . this  an early film by him  doesn  t have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious  anthropophagous  and  beyond the darkness  did . ultimately  its an incoherent film that doesn  t manage to involve the viewer in any way . without the sleaze factor either  it becomes very boring . as i said  others have enjoyed this film  but i just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing .  br    br   there are a few pluses for the film . ewa aulin  from  candy   is in it  and she looks pretty hot and is often naked . however  cult film icon klaus kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film . he seems bored with the role and doesn  t have the manic intensity he does at his finest . the music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore . still  this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring .        

=======================================================================================================

416 ===> such energy and vitality . you just can  t go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best . of course the choreography is wonderful  but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight . don  t miss this one .  

=======================================================================================================

417 ===> time spent watching this film was time wasted . i do not dislike science fiction . i do not reject any genre per se  since good work can be done in any genre . this film  however is not good work . i cannot fault the visuals  when not involving alien makeups   and the special effects are impressive . the story was not out  and  out bad  for a trekkish comic book . but the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers  interest  attention  money went . the direction alternated between sluggish and confusing  one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture  . the  acting  was mostly very bad indeed . there was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of  it was that way on the page and the director told me i was supposed to be mad  sad  scared  whatever . okay  so it was a sf series pilot . since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium . i  m astonished the pilot sold the series . or is the money also in the hands of technerds   

=======================================================================================================

418 ===> in     dick powell and ruby keeler sang and danced their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes . gold diggers of        nd street and footlight parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on . in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley  show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players .  br    br   all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it  s pace energy and lead james cagney . warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in   nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads  particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash . both lack the infectious energy of cagney however  who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical . he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers  unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend .  br    br   of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is . the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh  hugh herbert  guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size . busby berkeley  s dance numbers are surreal  suggestive and risqu and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in   . sadly  the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again . gentility and morality made sure of it .  

=======================================================================================================

419 ===> while i count myself as a fan of the babylon  television series  the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start . although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there  the pace of the gathering is slow  the makeup somewhat inadequate  and the plot confusing . worse  the characterization in the premiere episode is poor . although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems  i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series .  

=======================================================================================================

420 ===> i loved this film  seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen  the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things  and the fast pace was most enjoyable .  br    br   i do  as a singer and musical director  question one section of roby keeler  s vocal in  by a waterfall .  the key modulated  and she was suddenly singing much lower  in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin  like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals .  br    br   does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer  it sounds it to me . i would love to know .  br    br   thanks so much .  

=======================================================================================================

421 ===> i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission  and let me tell you  you  ll watch anything under those circumstances . not this piece of sht though .  br    br   the first five minutes set the tone by weak porn  movie quality acting  weird out  of  the  blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior . it gets worse after that . this movie does not have one single saving grace  and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch . it  s just horrible . i  ve seen quite many movies in my life and i  m not one of those snobby know  all critics  i mean i  ll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they  re bad . this one . . . man .  br    br   steer  well  clear of this one  my friend .  

=======================================================================================================

422 ===> it  s hard to say which comes out on top  james cagney  s charm and energy or the mouth  opening excesses of busby berkeley  s three grand showstoppers at the close . i give it a tie  with footlight parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early thirties musicals . although the movie clearly belongs to cagney  joan blondell adds immeasurably to the good  natured story line .  br    br   and what  s the story line  it  s about chester kent  cagney  who produces musicals  and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over . he starts doing prologues  live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts . he gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them  moving them around the country . he  s a ball of fire and ideas  and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things . but a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas nan prescott  blondell   his wise  cracking secretary  loves him but he  s too busy too notice an office girl in black  rimmed  round glasses  ruby keeler  wants a chance to dance his wife turns up saying she didn  t divorce him after all a blonde gold  digger is setting her hooks in him his partners are cheating him . . . my gosh  what  s next  this may all sound like a lot to digest  but everything happens fast  with cagney bouncing  strutting  striding  finger  snapping  barking orders and occasionally  until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing   doing a step or two just to show how it  s done .  br    br   instead of  let  s put on a show  gang  we have  we need to build three shows in three days  so lock the doors and let  s start rehearsing .  these three super prologues are going to feature   chorines  spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract  with forty kent units in deluxe movie houses . . . the whole apollo movie house circuit  exhaustion threatens  feet ache  but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes  which include ann sothern and dorothy lamour you can quickly spot sothern but lamour is more generic  stay the course  dancing their hearts out  giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty .  br    br   and then the curtains go up as each prologue is presented in separate movie houses  one after the other on the same night  with the owner of the apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he  ll save chester  s skin or not .  br    br   first up is  honeymoon hotel  with dick powell and ruby keeler in a  minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness  with brides and grooms  some might even be married   bedrooms and beds  and doors with  do not disturb  signs .  br    br   then on to the next theater and   minutes of  by a waterfall  that probably had the warner brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy . this number is so excessive   dozens of swimming girls  trees  fountains  a huge grotto with waterslides  a giant pool   you  d never think there was a depression on . berkeley pulls out all his tricks   synchronization  human patterns  legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things   and he does it in the water  with a lot of underwater photography looking up . the girls are sure game . they come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks . the whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting . ruby keeler  who has a couple of quick shots in the water  is the only one who looks a bit cautious .  br    br   and finally  the smash finale . . .   minutes of cagney dancing and singing with keeler to  shanghai lil   with all sorts of bar girls and their customers  unusual in that the races are mixed up . there  s cagney and keeler dancing on the bar  dancing on a table  cagney fighting . there are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines  hupping back and forth  rifles tossed and caught . then . . . this is true . . . a human picture forms of franklin roosevelt and the nra eagle . this may be the only hollywood musical production that has ever featured roosevelt  a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy chinese prostitutes .  br    br   that  s entertainment  folks . it  s great   br    br   of course  chester  s prologues get the big contract and nan gets chester . the movie is full of juicy clichs that make us smile . ruby keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along . joan blondell makes us forget about a lot of hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality . the movie  however  belongs to cagney  who grabs and shakes it  and to berkeley  a man for whom too much was never too much .  

=======================================================================================================

423 ===> my wife is a fanatic as regards this show . that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order . i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad . alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy  embrace of the vampire to name a few  the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals . i  ve seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child . i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don  t know if it was their own choosing or not . please . please don  t renew for another season as enough is enough  bob  

=======================================================================================================

424 ===> an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early      s . audiences must  ve been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle . quite a contrast from his  public enemy   years earlier . cagney does add spark  interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline  plot . but the highlight of the movie is the  elaborate production numbers back to back . first with the conservative  honeymoon hotel  number  then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling  by a waterfall  sequence  followed by the closing  shanghai lil  sequence  cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler . the  shanghai lil  number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown  anti climactic after the more exciting  incredibly mind boggling  by a waterfall  choreography . if i was the director i would  ve inserted the  shanghai lil  number in the middle  close with  by a waterfall   which blows the other  numbers out of the water so to speak  in my view the best of the  numbers . the  production numbers are the frosting on the cake  james cagney  s performance is added decoration to the cake . an outstanding musical achievement  a  star movie  the ultimate musical  well worth watching  you won  t be disappointed           

=======================================================================================================

425 ===> with the exception of family  this new season is worse than season one . i can  t imagine what they are thinking . as a fan of horror  can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem  but this series gets worse with each outing . i can  t imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day  toiling to churn out such crap . story  is that too much to ask for  character  how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories  if we are not engaged  who cares if they get carved up or whatever  almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting  going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting . even dante  s effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion . ironically  the production values and performances tend to be up to speed  while the content is utter crap . i have great hopes for exec producer  s garris  s valarie under the stairs  but we shall see .  

=======================================================================================================

426 ===> when it came out  this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment . to this day it  s more entertaining than most  in great part because it has james cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty  girl friday  played by joan blondell . also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by busby berkeley are pretty much a knock  out as far as that type of thing goes .  br    br   but this is a pretty strange movie . i mean in one of those numbers  you  ve got billy barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler  doing all kinds of weird stuff . ruby keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times  but at least she  s not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films . you  d never guess that dick powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star cagney . as for cagney  his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time . after a while it gets a bit too much . you expect him to walk out and say   hey  i  ve got a great idea for a prologue  the women are cigarettes  and they come out of a pack of smokes  oh no  we did that one last month   it  s funny but it gets a bit repetitive . in the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl  ruth donnelly  some of the established cagney gangster character comes out . in fact frequent b gangster director william keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching  and it seems at times that cagney and blondell are invoking something very  street  even though the characters aren  t criminal .  br    br   the musical numbers . . . what can you say  they stand alone as entertainment  the way that berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling . but none of them really mean anything . it means  honeymoon hotel   nothing really more or less . and the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately  since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn  t possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays . for example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper  things like that . the whole thing could only exist on film  so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous . i can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so  because this is a very polished production .  br    br   it  s great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills  and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like keeler . cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well . the music i would say is only mediocre  but mostly pleasing if repetitive . bacon  s direction in general is very suitable but never interesting . the film  s entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way . it  s a cut above most  let  s put on a show  films of the   s .  

=======================================================================================================

427 ===> some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series . particularly the writing . ok  the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink . i  m a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage . nothing new or genuinely interesting . few of them are visually creative . it  s just typical fabricated hollywood crap  uninteresting  childish  poorly conceived and in some cases  flat out laughable . much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity  other then that this series blows hard . i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth  graders to write the episodes . maybe they did .  

=======================================================================================================

428 ===> the energetic young producer of theatrical prologues  those staged performances  usually musical  that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days  must deal with crooked competition  fraudulent partners  unfaithful lovers  amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the footlight parade .  br    br   while closely resembling other warner  s musical spectaculars  notably the golddigger films  this movie had a special attraction none of the others had jimmy cagney . he is a wonder  loose  jointed and lithe  as agile as any tomcat  a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie . cagney grabs the viewers attention  never lets go  powering the rapid  fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma  buoyant charm .  br    br   the rest of the cast gives their best  as well . joan blondell is perfect as the smart  mouthed  big  hearted blonde secretary  infatuated with cagney  major quibble  why wasn  t she given a musical number   . dick powell  ruby keeler once again play lovers onstage  off the fact that her singing  acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing  powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead .  br    br   guy kibbee  hugh herbert are lots of fun as brothers  in  law  both scheming to cheat cagney in different ways . ruth donnelly scores as kibbee  s wealthy wife  a woman devoted to her handsome protgs . frank mchugh  s harried choreographer is an apt foil for cagney  s wit . herman bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger . mavens will spot little billy barty  jimmy conlin  maybe even john garfield during the musical numbers .  br    br   finally  there  s busby berkeley  choreographer nonpareil . his terpsichorean confections  sprinkled throughout the decade of the      s  were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that depression audiences wanted to enjoy . the big joke about berkeley  s creations  of course  was that they were meant  as part of the plot  to be stage productions . but no theater could ever hold these products of the master  s imagination . they are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera .  br    br   berkeley  s musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches  either a story  often rather bizarre  told with song  dance or else stunning geometrically designed numbers  eye candy  featuring plentiful chorus girls  overhead camerawork  a romantic tune . in a spasm of outr extravagance  footlight parade climaxes with three berkeley masterworks honeymoon hotel  and its pre  production code telling of a couple  s wedding night by a waterfall   dozens of unclad females  splashing  floating  diving in perfect patterns  designs  peer closely  you  ll see how the synchronous effects were achieved   and finally  shanghai lil   a fitting tribute to the talents of both cagney  berkeley .  

=======================================================================================================

429 ===> i  m sorry  i had high hopes for this movie . unfortunately  it was too long  too thin and too weak to hold my attention . when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream  i felt cheated . surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper  something more meaningful .  br    br   so  don  t buy a large drink or you  ll be running to the rest room . my kids didn  t enjoy it either . ah well .  

=======================================================================================================

430 ===> an opium den  a dirty little boy  actually a midget   prostitutes galore  a violent fracas in a dive  a motel for sexual shenanigans  scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot  a boozer falling down the stairs  a racially mixed clientle in a bar with asians  africans  and anglos treated equally  does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall  wrong . these are all scenes from a     musical .  br    br   the first half of  footlight parade  is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film . chester kent  cagney  is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals . his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day  john wayne in  the big trail .  before each showing of the flick  a dance number is presented as a prologue . shorts  news reels  serials  and cartoons would later serve the purpose . kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business . kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley . could it be that cagney  s character is patterned after berkeley  could be .  br    br   in preparation for the prologues  kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival . he uncovers the traitor  fires him  then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress . his assistant  nan prescott  joan blondell  soon to be mrs . dick powell  has the hots for kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress . a new singer from arkansas college shows up in the form of scotty blain  dick powell  who turns out to be a real find and is paired with bea thorn  ruby keeler  . the resulting three prologue musicals  which couldn  t possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day  are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago   honeymoon hotel    by a waterfall   and  shanghai lil .   br    br   of special note is the song and dance of tough  guy james cagney . like fred astaire and bill  bojangles  robinson  cagney  s dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed  although hours went into practice to get each step just right . not as good a singer as astaire  cagney  s singing  like astaire  s  sounded natural  unlike the crooning so popular at the time . it  s amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagney .  br    br   most critics prefer the  shanghai lil  segment over the other two . yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of  by a waterfall  is astonishing . how berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated . the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must  see . the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color .  br    br   though not nearly as socially conscious as  gold diggers of        footlight parade  stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen .  

=======================================================================================================

431 ===> at first i was convinced that this was a made  for  tv movie that wasn  t worthy of primetime . but after a few minutes of dumb  struck awe  i realized that there was at least comic value in the over  the  top stunts and c  movie acting . this movie would have gotten a  if my wife and i hadn  t laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face . it was like a less  funny spy version of the big hit  i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd  with even  worse acting . we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena  and not jim  after all of the hugging and high  fives . a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier .  

=======================================================================================================

432 ===>   footlight parade  is fascinating on so many levels . there is no way the supposedly staged  theater prologues  could have been produced in any theater on earth  of course . think of the huge pools and three  story tall fountains for  by a waterfall   for instance .  berkeley directed john garfield in  they made me a criminal  six years later and had the dead end kids singing  by a waterfall  as they took their showers .   br    br    shanghai lil  is the best production number in the picture . it  s a catalog of    s warner bros . sensibilities . note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes . you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house . here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others . i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a  card section  presentation of roosevelt  s image . there  s also the nra eagle   the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal . fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he  d pull the nation out of the depression . you  d never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm  of course . warner bros . wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f . d . r . administration .  br    br   dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker   lil .  she hardly even watches her feet as she dances  which was one of her signature flaws .  br    br   the pre  code stuff is fun . the  by a waterfall  number is wonderful in that regard . the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on . the spread  eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for   years . in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures .

433 ===> early  heavy  war  time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices  in effort to prevent any runaway inflation .  br    br   using scare  guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric  which was normal for the time  the government was concern that the sudden war  time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war .  br    br   it truly is a window into the past  historically and culturally .  

=======================================================================================================

434 ===> this movie is not schlock  despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions . a dark fable for adults . exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies  and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme . a weird movie with enticing visuals shadows and contrast are prominent . definitely worth a look  especially from fans of warhol and stylish decadence . through all the cruelty and wickedness  a moral  albeit twisted  can be gleamed .  

=======================================================================================================

435 ===> this movie was so bad that my i . q . went down about   points after seeing it . it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it . it must of been some kind of personal favor to van damme .  

=======================================================================================================

436 ===> this is the best sci  fi that i have seen in my   years of watching sci  fi . i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite . the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today .  

=======================================================================================================

437 ===> this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie . cheap looking  and worst of all  boring action scenes  the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence . only   minutes  but it feels like it goes on forever  even die  hard van damme fans  like myself  should avoid this one   

=======================================================================================================

438 ===> pleasant story of the community of pimlico in london who  after an unexploded ww  bomb explodes  find a royal charter stating that the area they live in forms part of burgundy .  br    br   this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them . a solid cast of british stalwarts  especially stanley holloway  makes this more believable .  br    br   there are some very nice moments in the film  such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them .  br    br   even though you always knew pimlico would become part of the uk again  the people of pimlico and as a consequence the viewer doesn  t mind when this happens  leaving a nice happy feeling .  br    br   it  s amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later . the producers must have got something right .

439 ===> the infamous ed wood  classic  plan  from outer space features an indignant alien calling the human race   . . . stupid  stupid  stupid stupid   i  d have to say exhibit a in that trial would probably this movie  a ridiculously silly sci  fi film .  br    br   falling action star jean claude van damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie  luke  a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers . while van damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels  he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the universal soldier series came around . so  probably cursing under his breath the whole way  he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks . you  ll find plenty of mindless violence  but i  d advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing . otherwise  you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it  s over .  br    br   luke is called into action against more universal soldiers after a really really really evil computer named seth  makes hal look like ghandi  turns all the other universal soldiers into evil  remorseless killers . of course this is what these things are programmed to do  but in this case they are killing their creators  not  the enemy  so that  s a problem .  br    br   i love the dumb logic of this movie . logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as michael jai white does to be in this movie . logic that dictates that the creator of seth be a blue  haired cyber  stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than old faithful does steam . logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time .  br    br   the film also features a daughter in peril character  wrestler bill goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier  and a romance so tacked on  i have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a good thing . and when this movie ends  it ends . not a minute after a gigantic towering finale  style explosion are the credits running . no epilogue  no where are they now  no final kiss  just explosion  hug  over . even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible .  br    br   while it  s no plan   ustr is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy van damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths . not to be seen on a serious stomach .

440 ===> my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer  today a writer and journalist  has put forward the theory that  just as british film  makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called  thatcher  s britain   the ealing comedies were intended as satires on  attlee  s britain   the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the     general election . this theory was presumably not intended to apply to  say   kind hearts and coronets   which is  if anything  a satire on the edwardian upper classes  or to  the ladykillers  or  the lavender hill mob   both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature . it can  however  be applied to most of the other films in the series  especially  passport to pimlico  .  br    br   pimlico is  or at least was in the forties  a predominantly working  class district of london  set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station . it is not quite correct to say  as has often been said  that the film is about pimlico  declaring itself independent  of britain . what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy . this means that  technically  pimlico is an independent state  and has been for nearly five hundred years  irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants . the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly  but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply .  br    br   because pimlico is not subject to british law  the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please  unhindered by the rationing laws . when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets  the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black  marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the  burgundians   as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves  to surrender .  br    br   many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system  either as an individual as happens in  the man in the white suit  or  the lavender hill mob   or as part of a larger community as happens in  whisky galore  or  the titfield thunderbolt  . the central theme of  passport  is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government  imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties . the film  s particular target is the rationing system . during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism  but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime . it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in      and organisations such as the british housewives  league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing . i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film  s satire were the  spivs   black marketeers   who play a relatively minor part in the action  or the housewives  league  who do not appear at all . the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats  who are portrayed either as having a  rules for rules  sake  mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all .  br    br   i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino .  indeed  i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film  . in      however  four years after the end of the war  the film  makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity  so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain . one of the best  known lines from the film is  we always were english and we always will be english and it  s just because we are english that we  re sticking up for our right to be burgundians  . there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense  tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico  all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics .  br    br   most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave  but in the last scene  after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain . global warming may have altered things slightly  but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief  whatever statistics might say to the contrary  that britain had an abnormally wet climate . the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important .  br    br   there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton  the grocer and small  time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico  and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor . in the main  however  this is  appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together  an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film . it lacks the ill  will and rancour of many more recent satirical films  but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that . it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and  with the possible exception of  kind hearts and coronets  is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies .       

=======================================================================================================

441 ===> van damme . what else can i say  bill goldberg . there we go . now we know this movie is going to be really horrible .  br    br   i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs  knowing it would be bad . but not even i thought it would be this bad . the plot is awful  van damme is getting old  finally   but unlike arnold  his movies are as well .  br    br   forget this movie . don  t see it . ever . i wouldn  t even be paid to see this film .  br    br      stars  at its heart lies a wonderful  action  packed thrill ride .  br    br   well  maybe not  but the marketers would sure like us to think so  wouldn  t they   br    br   john ulmer  

=======================================================================================================

442 ===> very funny  well  crafted  well  acted  meticulous attention to detail . a real window into a specific time and place in history . could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe . interesting how passport to pimlico anticipates the berlin airlift . a definite   .  

=======================================================================================================

443 ===>  here be spoilers   br    br   the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program  now called unisol . the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before . however the government is downsizing  the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened  so he takes steps to ensure his own safety . he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem . the only one who can stop them is deveraux  van damme  .  br    br   this movie is about one thing . choreographed fighting . the story is bad  and is soon drowned in all fights . whatever happens  and wherever they go  they fight . unfortunately for this movie  it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible . normally you  re pretty sure the hero will win  but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants . not where one is indestructible and can  t lose . then the fights just become a tool to stretch time . you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes . to further lower my opinion  a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are . well  there aren  t really that lot of them  because the characters are most men  there are at least one woman unisol though   but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once . the female leads get by with this  but we also pass through a strip  club  to use a computer no less  with much more undressed women . these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent  minded male audience .  br    br   so  in conclusion  boring fights . no more  no less . well  maybe less . . .  br    br        

=======================================================================================================

444 ===> gotta start with ed furlong on this one . you gotta . god bless this kid .   bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he  s really like in real life . he has a one  liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script . you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn  t even seem like furlong is even acting . maybe that  s why his performance was good . same with madsen . you keep thinking   i bet this guy is really like this in real life .  does madsen even have to act  just natural . vosloo has obviously moved on from the type  casted mummy guy . i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro  s performance . her reactions are spot  on in this film . i battled if she was hot or not  but realized i would just like to see more of her .  br    br   not a big fan of shoot  em out  hostage type films . but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing . it  s not just your standard robbers take over a bank  they kill hostages  and the good guys win in the end type of film . the twists keep on coming . . . and coming .  br    br   the caf scenes work best with the hand  held cams to show what it  s really like in there . not glossed over a bit . think like bourne ultimatum  lite  style on some scenes in the caf .  br    br   and for those bo bice fanatics out there  actor curtis wayne  who plays karl  will make you do a double take . these guys are twins .  br    br   as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town . made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries  states so they might have these accents . but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of . and some of them are smoking hot . moncia dean  need i say more .  

=======================================================================================================

445 ===> i  ll be honest . the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it  s in the imdb bottom    . and right now  i  m wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another  check  on that same list .  br    br   van damme is luc deveraux  who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a  hal  to defend itself . and yes  after all the obligate explosions  shoot  outs and chases he is the last one standing . combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set  up it makes sure it  s place in the infamous list is just .  br    br   only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list .     .  

=======================================================================================================

446 ===> i have to say i totally loved the movie . it had it  s funny moments  some heartwarming parts  just all around good . me  personally  really liked the movie because it  s something that finally i can relate to my childhood . this movie  in my opinion  is geared more towards the young gay population . it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up . all the taunting  name  calling  and not knowing is something i  like most other young feminine boys  will always remember  and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay . so  i would definitely recommend seeing this movie . probably shouldn  t really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it  

=======================================================================================================

447 ===> i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn  t make it to the end credits . first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest . second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting  lame sfx and extremely poor direction . pales in comparison to the original .  br    br   anyone ever hear about the old et atari     fiasco  for those who haven  t let me fill you in . it  s     . . . et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time . . . atari decides to release a movie tie  in game on their     home console system . to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari     et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn  t even give them away let alone sell them .  br    br   what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story  look at the  .  rating and figure it out for yourself .  br    br   awful film . . . imdb forced me to give it a  out of   because their rating systems doesn  t go as low as  let alone into the negatives .  

=======================================================================================================

448 ===> this film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast . david strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and danny vinson plays a perfect pussy  whipped southern husband . the slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film .  

=======================================================================================================

449 ===> after seeing the low  budget shittier versions of the  universal soldier  franchise  i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie . well  it seemed this prayer was answered  but not the way i hoped . universial soldier  is just intense as poetry reading at your local library . no  even that would be more intriguing . the fight sequences are top  notch  bruce lee quality  which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture . that and having former wcw tough  guy legend  goldberg  playing the villain . however  placing goldberg as seth  s sidekick lieutenant would  ve been better .  br    br   we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself . it  s like some film school students slapped it together . the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west  s ego is what really did this movie in . for example luc  s daughter  hillary looks like she  s at least      years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago . how is that possible  tell me that  the part in which luc  s partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re  goddamn diculous  you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie . c  mon . the director could  ve spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut . but oooh nooo   br    br   speaking of the plot  it sucks  compared to the first movie  universal soldier   s plot watered down and worthless . where  s the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re  enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something  this was the dawn of the millennium  you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia  orwellian type of future cesspit . corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad  sad  sad sequel .  br    br   from what i seen double impact  under siege   robocop   and hell  even the cheap  ass  no class terminator knock  off  class of      is more entertaining than this   

=======================================================================================================

450 ===> this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen . i love the backwoods feel of this movie . the movie is very realistic and believable . this seems to take place in another era  maybe the late    s or early    s . henry thomas works well with the young baby . very moving story and worth a look .  

=======================================================================================================

451 ===> ok i saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it  s unisol  s best movie now plot luc devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner maggie  who  s been through countless hours of training and combat with him  to refine and perfect the unisol program in an effort to make a new  stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated  intelligent  and agile . all of the new unisols  which are faster and stronger than their predecessors  are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called seth  a self  evolving thought helix . when seth discovers that the universal soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts  he takes matters into his own  hands  to protect himself . killing those who try to shut off his power  and unleashing his platoon of super  soldiers  led by the musclebound romeo  seth spares deveraux  only because deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built  in program that will shut seth down in a matter of hours . with the help of a hacker named squid  seth takes human form . not only must luc contend with ambitious reporter erin  who won  t leave his side  but luc also must contend with general radford  who wants to take extreme measures to stop seth . seth has also kidnapped luc  s injured    year  old daughter hillary  and is now holding her hostage . luc is the only person who can rescue hillary  because luc knows firsthand how a unisol thinks  feels  and fights . now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just  so  happened to be there and the soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when vanne damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when luc is now human and seth is  x stronger and faster than any other unisol and luc can take a hit from him . with the final fight when luc smashes him to pieces i was really surprised that the pieces didn  t melt and reform him  terminator   . another thing that bugs me is how the hell does vanne damme get good actors to play relatives i mean in the case of vanne damme it  s completely off the grid of how science fiction this movie is . the music score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you  d rather cut a blackboard with a knife well universal soldier  is like that . the good points are there  s no dolph  hooray  and unlike the  st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the  st one there are many  i  m still haunted by the scenes in    also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists  if you don  t believe me look it up   

=======================================================================================================

452 ===> a sweet  natured young mountain man with a sad past  henry thomas  comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her . the town elders generally support him in keeping the child  though a local temptress  cara seymour  thinks little of the new family . a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman  david strathairn at his creepiest  have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way . this is a charming slice  of  life in the ozarks in the same vein as  where the lillies bloom    the dollmaker  . all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple  living   but not simple  minded   american folk . a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly  safe family viewing .  

=======================================================================================================

453 ===> terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever . and as for the feminist polemic  it  s laughable . i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief i  m glad i did go to see it . that  s because i now have an immediate answer to the question  what  s the worst film you  ve ever seen   plus  i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson . but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world  as is revealed in the closing credits  .  br    br   i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film . all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes  a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady  and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public . so why shouldn  t she think she could get away with the self  indulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson   

=======================================================================================================

454 ===> this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick   carrie  and others  and barbara bach . it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it  s worth it . this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time . it seems that  young newswomen  karen  vicky  and jennifer  travel to the small city of solvang  california to cover a festival when a mix  up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller  lassick  and his strange wife virginia . vickie stays behind  feeling ill  as the other  are off to film their story . she is soon murdered at the house  in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system  she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement  . soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover . jennifer is fighting with her  ex   lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home  her hosts  whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son  devise a plot to try to murder her as well . virgina does not totally agree with earnest  s plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior . here the film turns almost comic as junior  portrayed hysterically by stephen furst  is a deformed  mentally deficient  manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it  s supposed to be scary . this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done . the actors  actresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick  furst  and bach and although it  s not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining   

=======================================================================================================

455 ===> this is the worst movie i have ever seen  and i have seen quite a few movies . it is passed off as an art film  but it is really a piece of trash . it  s one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing  but that cannot make up for sally potter  s disgustingly obvious tribute to herself . the plot of this movie is nonexistent  and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end . especially where she starts singing . it  s absolutely unreal .  

=======================================================================================================

456 ===> it  s true that danny steinmann  s  the unseen  is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot  no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single clich the genre has brought forward over the decades  but that doesn  t necessarily make it a bad film . on the contrary  my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little    s shock  feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting . the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival  but their hotel forgot to register their booking . in their search for a place to stay  the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator ernest keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion . one by one the girls experience that keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house .  the unseen  can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics  psycho  and  the texas chainsaw massacre  . the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films  like twisted family secrets in the cellar  voyeurism  crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens . still  i don  t consider these to be negative remarks  as  the unseen  is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade . although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast  director steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house  unseen  like the title promised . the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre . sydney lassick  immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient charley cheswick in  one flew over the cuckoo  s nest  is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest keller . his persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed . also stephen furst  who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen  gives away a tremendous performance as  junior  . he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving .  the unseen  is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early    s film that will certainly appeal to fans of    s exploitation and generally weird stuff .  

=======================================================================================================

457 ===> probably encouraged by admirers of her much  better  orlando   potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes  directs  stars  and actually co  writes the music  including a mawkish love song . the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her . but potter  s character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable  and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango . perhaps if she hadn  t cast herself it might have worked . she just can  t act  whether playing herself or not . pretentious  over  ambitious  dull  and silly .

459 ===> in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass  this film was probably quite revealing in its day . however  i get the feeling that neorealism was never really director de sica  s bag  since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country . after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage  toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan . he organises the inhabitants into community action  and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables . that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me  as these people have far more important things to think about  like where the next pot noodle is going to come from . anyway  de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are . it  s all down to capitalism of course  and in order to illustrate this  he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land . brilliant  to his credit  though  by this time he has given up on making a serious film  and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures  all fur coats and cigars . they want that land  but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense . by a bizarre stroke of luck  his old  deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove . he uses it to shower gifts on his mates  who prove just as greedy as the cigar men . i reckon this film was a missed opportunity . to address the theme of poverty  as not many film  makers had done until then  and then get caught up in a fairy tale  to me seems a bit daft . how come  great  directors get away with child  like plot turns like the ones we see here  hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks . de sica  however  is proclaimed as a genius for this . surely the fact that these people are so poor  that their faith is unswerving  and that miracles never happen to them  is enough for any story  teller to work on .  br    br

460 ===> simply put  this is the best movie to come out of michigan since . . . well  ever  evil dead eat your heart out  hatred of a minute was some of the oddest  and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time . i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip  or a good case of the willies   

=======================================================================================================

461 ===> i actually have a fondness for christopher lee  but this just wasn  t up to his other performances . . . and he was one of the better actors .  br    br   the film does not live up to its premise . it  s not that scary  it  s overly melodramatic  and it draaaaaags . every time i thought   oh  here comes the good part  the good part never quite arrived .  br    br   the evil ones aren  t at all convincing . most of the other characters were also lacking in depth .  br    br   perhaps if i  d been in the proper frame of mind  i might have enjoyed some mstie  fication at this film  s expense  but . . . . naaahhh . . . didn  t really seem to be worth the effort . it wasn  t really very good  it wasn  t really very bad  it was just mediocre .  

=======================================================================================================

462 ===> i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews . the movie is not great  but it has a lot of great elements . the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great . the story is slow and weak  but entertaining . the acting is bad  but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel . the music is pretty good and the gore is good . it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell . i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable  it was still enjoyable . the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy . the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children   and up . there was no sex scenes . i gave it  out of   and i think that is fair . i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do . the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film  the devil is quite creepy .

463 ===> i am a   th grader at my high school . in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch . so we did . i am firm believer that we went to the moon  being that my father works for nasa . even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched  the guy who created it has some serious balls . first of all did he have to show jfk getting shot  and how dare he use all those biblical quotes . the only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates  which is good b  c in my class we have weekly debates . this movie did nothing to change my mind . i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie . michael moore next movie could be called  a funny thing happened on spetember   th  or  a funny thing happened on the way to the white house  .

464 ===> so what constitutes a real independent film  in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge  i  m sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy .  br    br   which is why we should be glad that films like  hatred of a minute  exist . across the board  this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template  indie horror film  . love it or hate it   hatred  isn  t afraid of being what it is  and in watching this film  you get the real sense that kallio  the director  didn  t just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place  he  s in this to tell stories . good ones . you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store  but don  t be fooled  this story is also about love  about good people pushed over the edge  and that oh  so  distant light at the end of the tunnel .  br    br   if you expect smut  or an evil dead ripoff  stay away from this film . but if you dig the finer points of the horror  suspense genres  check this film out .  br    br   yes . bruce campbell did produce this movie  and i  m sure he  s proud to tell anyone that it  s not  evil dead  . bruce has never tried to bank on his  ash  image  and it  s obvious that he didn  t get involved with  hatred  so that it could do so either .  br    br   my advice  though  to all dead  ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr . campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr . kallio and mr . campbell are trying to show you .  br    br   the acting is well done  although nothing about this film is oscar caliber  perhaps intentionally   it  s good to see compassionate performances in a horror film . so often  actors in films such as these don  t even seem to try  with  hatred   it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously  never resorting to typical horror  film campiness .  br    br   technically   hatred  is about as competent as indie film gets . the editing is fast paced  the cinematography is good given the budget  and  hatred  keeps a quick pace  without any bog  down points or bad anti  climaxes .  br    br   all in all  hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi  million dollar fake indies  but personally  i don  t see a problem with that . it  s a film by folks who actually care about the medium . people who reached into thier broke ass pockets  pulled out thier nickles and dimes  threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie .  br    br   check this one out .

465 ===> this so  called  documentary  tries to tell that usa faked the moon  landing . year right .  br    br   all those who have actually studied the case knows different .  br    br   first of all there is definitely proof . when the astronauts was on the moon  they brought back many pounds of rock from the moon  for geological studies . these where spread around the world to hundreds of labs  who tested them . and they all concluded that they came from the same planet  not earth because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth  but similar to those calculated to be on the moon . i . e . the conspiracy theorists never studies anything they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest .  br    br   another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing  i . e . the flag moves . there is a logical explanation the astronaut moved it with his hand  so it moved . and what proves this well  if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage  they would see that the flag never moves after the astronaut have let it be  i . e . the conspiracy theorists are bad  scientists  they cant study a subject properly  or only studies it until they have what they came for  so that they can make a lie from that  and make a profit  i . e . this so  called  documentary   .  br    br   a claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places  because there are different light  sources  the artificial lighting from the studio . once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong  as usual   the same would happen in an earth desert at night  with no light  sources . but i doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a star treck  convention is held over .  br    br   the conspiracy theorists are in denial  big time . they only see what they want to see . so they make up all these lies to seem important  that is a fact .  

=======================================================================================================

466 ===> i think this show is definitely the greatest show . jessica alba does such a great job in it . michael weatherly also does an awesome job  as well as the rest of the cast . the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing . it  s like watching a   hour movie . it  s definitely worth watching .  

=======================================================================================================

467 ===> when i was   i saw the documentary  a funny thing happened on the way to the moon  . i actually liked  and believed in it for a couple of years . but then i grew up  and began to think  and when i had sought more information . this is more info from reel sources  and non  biased sources . when i started at university  not so long ago  i asked an assistant  professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories . what he said shocked me he said that all those theories where lies . that baffled me  i did not believe it first  but then he presented evidence for his claims . he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject  humans did not go to the moon  . the most outrages claim was that the apollo  craft could not travel through the van  allen  radiation  belt  without the crew perishing from radiation . the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum  anti  radiation  alloy . it is not that well  known . and the exact specifications are a secret . and why is it a secret well  why should they reveal it back then   if they where in a space race with the russians  then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation .  br    br   and then there is the biggest evidence of all the moon stones . when the apollo  missions did go to the moon  they brought back many rocks from the moon  to give to geologists and similar scientists  who are documenting all things about the moon . these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon . because the internal basic elements  which all matter consist of  are also made of special isotopes  that are different from quarry to quarry  land to land  and especially planet from planet . the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved  that they do not come from earth . the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram  s of these rocks  all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth  and from the same planet . ergo the moon  landings where not fake . nasa did go to another planet the moon  though it is not a planet  but a satellite to a planet  a moon  duuh  . these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world . it has been proved humans did go to the moon  it is a fact  pronto .  br    br   but i do not worry most conspiracy  theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated  that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts . the fact remains humans did walk on the moon .  

=======================================================================================================

468 ===> this is a film for entertainment i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film . i personally find this film funny  audacious  and memorable . it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess . this film was done very well i might add  in the    s a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person  s sexuality . this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not  it is however about love  in all it  s strange forms . this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the    s in hollywood  or in california . pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men . women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career . bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community .  br    br   then the fantasy begins   let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have  well this movie  which in any way was better than that dismal redo  the next big thing  . perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better .  br    br   i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the    s and it still brings a smile to my lips now . i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny  tender movie  to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun . some people need to lighten up    and this is the film you should do it with   br    br    

=======================================================================================================

469 ===> i watched this video at a friend  s house . i  m glad i did not waste money buying this one . the video cover has a scene from the     movie capricorn one . the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow  ups  most not related to manned flight . sibrel  s smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast . he edits in his own voice  over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say . the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film . his claims about radiation  shielding  star photography  and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa  the astronauts  or american in general . his science is bad  and so is this video .  

=======================================================================================================

470 ===> i appreciated the photography  the textures  the colours and often  unlike one comment  the lighting . what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline . i found it often disjointed  badly edited and at times difficult to follow . my version was    minutes  imdb shows one at    m . possibly the cuts and subtitles didn  t help . i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed . miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine  i just wanted a little more dialogue . if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one  try  hideous kinky  with kate winslet .  

=======================================================================================================

471 ===> i was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the scott brothers were involved . unfortunately my hopes were dashed  yet again we are led to believe that the kgb are a group of inept morons who don  t have a clue what they are doing . at one point there is a laughable scene where  kgb agents couldn  t handle one cia agent . i grow weary of these biased  one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the spy game that went on during the cold war . i find it laughable that the us is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in ww  and beyond . just like the pathetic u      where we are led to believe that the us obtained the enigma machine  again  utterly false .  br    br   to its credit   the company  is very well filmed and acted . the locales are also exceptionally well realised . alfred molina puts in a great performance as does keaton  the conflict between them is very well done  . i really wanted to like this show and no doubt i will end up watching the other  episodes but i really wish that us productions would stop trying to portray their spies  servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet . it gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a      .  br    br   s  

=======================================================================================================

472 ===> when i think about this movie  all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world . texture  smell  color  that  s how i think this movie should be judged in terms of . see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace  or the sweltering turkish bath  and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice  coarse cloth  smooth skin  scented oils  flickering flames  satin rustle . don  t just watch and listen  be absorbed  let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you .  

=======================================================================================================

473 ===> thoughtless  ignorant  ill  conceived  career  killing  where is the talented angela jones now    deeply unfunny garbage . it  s no wonder reb braddock hasn  t directed anything else since  anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules  based on his own script  with the help of quentin tarantino himself  and creates something like this  anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world  doesn  t deserve a second break . under the circumstances  the performances are good  the actors do what they  re told to do  and they do it well . it  s just that they shouldn  t have done it in the first place .  br    br    out of  .  

=======================================================================================================

474 ===> this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion  with cool characters  lots of action  and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren  however alex karzis is awful as the villain  . the story is very good  and i found the kids to be likable for the most part  plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this  . the action scenes are excellent  and it  s almost like die hard except it  s set in a school   plus kata dob is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick  . the finale is very exciting  and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well   however i just wished it had another villain  because alex karzis just didn  t cut it as the villain way too ott  and laughable for my tastes . this should be higher then  .  in my opinion  as i thought it was a great action film  and while the kids  were very stupid at times  they got quite resourceful as the movie went along   plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well  . the ending is very amusing  and corey sevier  s character was my favorite student   plus dolph has still got it  . this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion  with cool characters  lots of action  and an amazing performance from lundgren   but alex karzis is awful as the villain  still i highly recommend this one  . the direction is very good  . sidney j . furie does a very good job here with great camera work  good angles  and keeping the film at a very fast pace  . there is a bit of blood and violence . we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds  knife in the side of the head  bloody arrow hits  an impaling  and other minor stuff . the acting is fantastic  . dolph lundgren is amazing as always  and is amazing here  he is extremely likable  kicks that ass as usual  had great chemistry with the kids  had an awesome character  is very charismatic  and he may not have shown a great emotional rage  he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch   he is one of my favorite actors   lundgren rules       . alex karzis is god awful as the villain  he is laughably ott  was boring  and not menacing at all  he also annoyed the crap out of me . kata dob is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do  she was the real villain in my opinion  . corey sevier is funny as mick  he was my favorite student  and i really started to warm up to him in the  nd half  i liked him a lot   he had good chemistry with dolph too . dov tiefenbach  willy   chris collins  hogie   mpho koaho  jay tee   danielle hampton  alicia   nicole dicker  charlee  all do great as the students . jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiance . rest of the cast do fine . overall i highly recommend this one  .     out of   

=======================================================================================================

475 ===> excruciatingly slow  paced  over  scripted black comedy with a too  clever premise and bad acting .  br    br   maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode  but by the last half  you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already .  

=======================================================================================================

476 ===> there has been a political documentary  of recent vintage  called why we fight  which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation . it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq . yet  a far more famous series of films  with the same name  was made during world war two  by hollywood director frank capra . although considered documentaries  and having won oscars in that category  this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop  more in the vein of leni reifenstal  s triumph of the will  scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes . that said  that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries  such as the bbc  s lauded the world at war  lacked  nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable . they are skillfully made  and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store  i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase . i chose goodtimes dvd  s four dvd collection of the series .  br    br   rarely has something free been so worth invaluable . while there are no extras on the dvds  and the sound quality of the prints varies  these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago  when racism was overt  as in many of the classic warner brothers pro  war cartoons of the era   and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts . the seven films  produced between     and      are prelude to war  the nazis strike  divide and conquer  the battle of britain  the battle of russia  the battle of china  and war comes to america .  br    br   overall  the film series is well worth watching  not only for the obvious reasons  but for the subtle things it reveals  such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars  rather than the modern singular  or the most overused graphic in the whole series  a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria . yet  it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars . the lesson of world war one  avoid foreign entanglements  was not applicable to world war two  whose own lesson  act early against dictatorships  has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since korea  vietnam  nor iraq . the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today  s information  clogged times . it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today  but at least you  ll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position  nor will you be the last .  

=======================================================================================================

477 ===> well  here we have yet another role reversal movie . there were many worth watching  despite the tired plot of gender reversal . however  this one is not . in previous reviews  i think i  ve made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late   s . this is one of them .  br    br    just one of the girls  is about a high school kid  corey haim  who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school . he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader  marie  nicole eggert  . obviously  he can  t keep up the charade for too much longer .  br    br   i thought this movie was utter crap  and it wasn  t even funny . but  judging by a majority of reviews  it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen  nicole eggert  are the only ones who  d want to watch this . if you  re looking for a good haim feature  or role switching comedy   look no further than     . this is about the point that haim  s career tanked .  

=======================================================================================================

478 ===> this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war . the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler  s rise .  br    br   every school child  nay  every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos . history has been repeating itself over and over again  the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups  are still working to these evil group  s advantage .  br    br   by sitting back and letting hitler as early as     be aggressive  france  america and england caused over   million people  s deaths . americans  french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties .  br    br   these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs . they don  t tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them  fighting hitler . this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war .  

=======================================================================================================

479 ===> the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller  looking surprisingly aged a year after  tarzan and the huntress   is bad  in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better . it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller  shooting in beautiful scenery in mxico  with a top star of that country  andrea palma  and multiple award  winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa  and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score . although it may have cost less for filming abroad  it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series  taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania  and with impressive dcors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu  especially the exterior  built on steep rocks .  kurt neumann should have stayed as director  instead of robert florey  who gives it a very slow pace . neumann had done a fine work with  tarzan and the amazons    tarzan and the leopard woman  and  tarzan and the huntress   and finished his career directing the classic  the fly  the year before his death while florey became a television director  after a career of few remarkable films . if weissmuller looks tired  the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others  but the worst character is benji  an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs  that have a caribbean air  in a location supposed to be africa and shot in mxico   boring and decidedly of dubious taste  it was a sad farewell to weissmuller  s tarzan .  

=======================================================================================================

480 ===> what can i say about it  it  s another hollywood  s horror flick with very high budget    million dollars  . not scary at all  it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace . a lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more . catherine zeta  jones is beautiful as always  lili taylor is also a good actress . the architecture of the hill house is amazing  all these monuments  statues  furniture . . . delicious  however i don  t like the ending because it was so luscious . check this one out and form your own opinion on it . i give this picture  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

481 ===> be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence .  br    br   the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways .  br    br   each story has only a few minutes  so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot . just an sketchy idea of a plot . the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer . however  that just didn  t work out because you didn  t get to know the characters in before or these  jokes  were just silly .  br    br   this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart . a dozen times . or even more  i don  t know and i don  t care .  

=======================================================================================================

482 ===> some films just simply should not be remade . this is one of them . in and of itself it is not a bad film . but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the     film of the same title . liam neeson was excellent as he always is  and most of the cast holds up  with the exception of owen wilson  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke . but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it  s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects . again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film . but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .

483 ===> you know jason  you know freddy  and you know leatherface . now  get ready for the safety pin killer  that  s right  in killer workout  a dumb slasher movie if i  ve ever seen one  the unseen murderer dispatches his  or her   victims with an oversized  novelty safety pin . it is an odd choice to be sure  the kind of thing that deserves an explanation . naturally  the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing .  br    br   as the title suggests  an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect . in fact  the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer  just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed . and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead  it  s really just process of elimination .  br    br   oddly  while the entire name cast is killed off  the aerobics classes continue in earnest . in fact  nothing is capable of stopping the dancing . while three men are murdered in the next room  the workout goes on . death isn  t even a factor one character dies  but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions . director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout .  br    br   cop chases  explosive tanning beds  and hundreds of shots of women  s exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure . much like the woman caught in the tanning bed  i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout . finally  thankfully  the end flashed on the screen . what happened next  you got it  shots of the women working out . not even the end of the movie can stop them   br    br

484 ===> the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house  good effects work and sound work  a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house . there are scenes that make you jump  and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past  i found interesting . there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets  curtains and the house itself . jerry goldsmith  s score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . what i wish could  ve happened is for something a little more intense . jan de bont had a pg    rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much . poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago  and it still holds up . the haunting could  ve used a few more scenes of pure terror . the ending was for me  a little anticlimactic . overall  i enjoyed it . the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump . i just wish it scared me more .

485 ===> this is quite possibly the most retarded    s slasher ever realized  but how can you be harsh on a film that features non  stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises  taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits  prior to being a horror film   aerobicide  is a   minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids  silicons and other body  stimulating fitness products . if you  d leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable    s tunes  there probably only have about   minutes of story left . plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health  freaks with a big safety pin  yeah  . the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun  bathing device . several years later people turn up dead in the same spa . you don  t really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there  s a link between the murders and the burning incident  now do you  investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer  and charles napier look  alike   and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest    s beauty i  ve ever seen  looking through the credits  her name  s dianne copeland apparently  and she didn  t do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma  movie called  surf nazis must die  . what a wasted opportunity  she may not have been a great actress  but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business . the amount of gore and the quality of the make  up effects are nothing special  neither . we  re treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh . the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable  but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore  anyway .  aerobicide   a . k . a .  killer workout   is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night  but nevertheless feel like watching a film  it actually would make a terrific double  feature with  death spa  . both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes  and both films are pretty dumb .

486 ===> jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts  one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget  box office ones . it  s a mere   minutes and doesn  t feature many sets  and the only star is barbara stanwyck . but what a star  of course .  br    br   stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert . the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor  who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help . some psychological battling there .  br    br   it  s a surprisingly effective little movie  its short length makes it taut  and that stanwyck is great should go without mention  but i  ll still praise her every time  .

487 ===> on the way back from imc   san jose  california   all five  mind you  three of us hardcore kamal fans  of us had reached a unanimous verdict vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday . not to mention  we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year .  br    br   i won  t blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan  on vijay tv  . he said something like   tamizh cinema  la photography  editing  la namba munnera  na maadri screenplay  direction  acting  la innum namba munnera  la   tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing  but we have hardly improved  when it comes to screenplay  direction and acting   . while you  re watching vv  those words ring very true .  br    br   now  here are the   reasons to hate this movie  br    br    . harris jeyaraj  br    br    . harris jeyaraj  br    br    . harris jeyaraj i  m barely holding myself from using expletives here  but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his  remember  anniyan    ghajini   with the jarring cacophony  he bills as background music . the next time i have an eardrum transplant  he  s paying for it .  br    br    . songs neither do the songs help move the movie  s narration spatially  temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice . the film feels like it  s made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them .  br    br    . a short gone too far . vv at best is fit to be a short story  not a  hour plus  thriller  . to use a clich here  like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on only in this case you don  t want it to . the later part of a movie feels like a big drag .  br    br    . kamal  jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could  ve produced more sparks than this lead pairing . there  s no reason you would root for them to make it together . in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie  they make a good irritant to the narration . hate to say this  but kamalini mukerjhee  s   minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus  thenali  .  br    br    . kamal haasan  s accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us and it isn  t new either . he  s been doing it since  thoongadae thambi thoongadae  . it  s simply gets on the nerve . imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us . he doesn  t leave it at the immigration either  he offers doses of advice to his men  bewildered tn cops from keeranor  sathoor and beyond  in chaste kamanglish   wha we hav here is plain bad police wok    of course with nauseating effect .  br    br    . logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale . gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense . which d . c . p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after  the scene inside the theatre was so bad  towards the climax we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero  s iq .  is he stupid  can  t he just use his siren or lights    on a busy madras road  kamal  the  cop  on  a  police  jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude   .  can  t he just use his gun     the guy on a bike  starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time  . i  m not voting in favour of the later  but i  m just trying to explain the mood inside .  br    br    . gore  violence if i wanted to watch women being raped  their throats getting slashed  more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity  i would sit at home and rather watch a  police report  or  kuttram  . the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story  not overwhelm it  somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions  rapes  murders  are and what the mainstay  story  is   br    br     . even a double shot espresso couldn  t get the pain out of the head .

488 ===> dark angel is a futuristic sci  fi series  set in post  apocalyptic seattle  centering on max  jessica alba   a genetically enhanced young woman  on the run from her creators .  br    br   the dark angel universe is absorbing   not as much as say buffy  but absorbing nonetheless  with an interesting and believable set of characters . certainly  it is not for everyone  but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there . dark angel is criminally overlooked  and under  rated  and was unfortunatly canceled after only  series . which was a great shame  as this had the potential to become a great series  although its   episodes are only   shy of long running bbc sci  fi comedy red dwarf . as it is dark angel remains unfinished  so seek it out  and if you want more  lobby fox to make another series .

489 ===> i pity people calling kamal hassan  ulaganaayakan  maybe for them ulagam is tollywood  comeon guys . . this movie is a thriller without thrill . .  br    br   come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs .  br    br   technically good but style over substance kamal doesn  t look like a police officer  there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving  valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie .  br    br   kamal at his best is the best in tollywood

490 ===> leonard maltin must  ve been watching some other movie .  though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource  please disregard his comments on this one .  he states  starts off well then fizzles  when it  s really the reverse   starts off tepid then catches fire  . the plot is about as simple as it gets . happy mom  happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach  dad incapacitated in accident  mom runs off to get help  meets up with dangerous escaped convict . mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life .  br    br   good white  knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker  appearing suddenly  the director  john sturges  films it in a clever way that will make you gasp  around halfway through as the cunning  desperate criminal . meeker is an unusually flippant  reckless actor  at least here and in the classic  kiss me deadly   and he happily snatches the keys to the film  s narrative and speeds off with the top down . his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying  pretty neat  huh   when he  s especially pleased with his misdeeds . there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage  barbara stanwyck   don  t go away  . she fires back  where would i go    they  re in the middle of nowhere  and he realizes sitcom  ishly  yeah  that  s right  . the friction between them is a hoot .  br    br   there are flaws  somewhat ridiculous ones . there  s one scene where the police  who have been chasing after meeker for some time  stop stanwyck  s car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would  and pretends to be asleep as she  s being questioned . a . he looks conspicuously un  masculine in this pose and b . i think it  s safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion .  br    br   still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

491 ===> the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between . but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable .  br    br   but krista allen really rocked in the movie . her voice was so seducing and sexy . the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do . krista really is one of the best in such roles . she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last  minutes  which is the interesting part of the movie .  br    br   burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star . he could have chosen a better script than this . ireally think he did for money .  

=======================================================================================================

492 ===> as a disclaimer  i  ve seen the movie    times in the last   years  and i only just saw the musical this week . this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn  t in the musical  however  it tainted me when i watched the musical     br    br   i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role  along with kasey . i think her  let me dance for you scene  is one of the best parts of the movie  a worthwhile addition compared to the musical . the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical  as well as the cast which is at least   times bigger  easier to do in the movie of course  . the decors  lighting  dancing  and singing are also much superior in the movie  which should be expected  and was indeed delivered .  br    br   the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie  the new ones are quite good ones  and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion  especially compared to a musical which has few decors . the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking  and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters  but their dancing is impeccable  and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical  

=======================================================================================================

493 ===> i am a big      s movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me . so i gave this a shot  after all it  s the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian . i have watched much less of lloyd  s silent films then of chaplins but i have to say i  m a much bigger chaplin fan . anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didn  t finish it . i can understand why his sound career was so limited  he didn  t get very good material to work with . after you  ve seen chaplin  abbott and costello  the three stooges  martin and lewis  the marx brothers  and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs  or violence in general   this one is very forgettable . i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me . maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film  at least it seemed that way  is before he gets in a ring . i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time   out of   . don  t watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again  very flat . for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend  kelly the second  made a few years earlier  another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase . these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel .  

=======================================================================================================

494 ===> as many reviewers here have noted  the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story . i have never seen the stage version of the story  and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers . perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film  but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas  show . the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try  out group . this way our attention is focused on the dancers  movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try  outs . douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part . apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one  and the backstage clich  ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added . i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film . the repeated intrusions cassie made during try  outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and  or luck . however  this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past  and it  s curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again . the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the  i can do that  number  but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories . frankly  their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this .  of  stars .  

=======================================================================================================

495 ===> an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting  if only you could bring yourself to care . this  twisting and turning  i speak of refers not to the story  which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole  but to the director  s inability to keep the characters  faces even remotely centered in the frame . on the other hand  angie harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear .  br    br   the only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it . when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all  star cast  you might be inclined to think something stinks .  br    br   and indeed  it does .  

=======================================================================================================

496 ===> this is a great film   the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now . i may not have seen the play  but even if i had it wouldn  t stop me thinking that the film is just as good .  

=======================================================================================================

497 ===> mst     should do this movie . it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen . first of all  you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in     and pays his rent in cash . there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job . also  the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot . this movie sucked . i cannot express the extremite that this movie was . every single actor was terrible . even the chick at the trailer park . i crap on this garbage . what a waste of time .  

=======================================================================================================

498 ===> hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure thet you would have liked it as much as i . i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing . dancing and singing . the song one is an all time fave musical song too and the strutters at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one  

=======================================================================================================

499 ===> this ranks as one of the worst movies i  ve seen in years . besides cuba and angie  the acting is actually embarrassing . wasn  t archer once a decent actress  what happened to her  the action is decent but completely implausible . the make up is so bad it  s worth mentioning . i mean  who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film . someone should tell the make up artist  and the dop that you  re not supposed to actually see it . the ending is a massive disappointment  along the lines of  and then they realized it was all a dream   br    br   don  t waste your time or your money . you  re better off just staring into space for  hours .  

=======================================================================================================

500 ===> this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool  and was the uk  s answer to films such as  blackboard jungle  . the film stands the test of time quite well  with all the moral stories still  or even more  relevant today . the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum  stanley baker  peter cushing and anne heywood . baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties  with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age  they will end up being responsible adults .  br    br   notable cameos in the film include freddie starr  fred fowell  and melvyn hayes  gloria  . tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister  they are real life brother and sister  who are caught up in an arsonists web . tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film  the interpretor  .  br    br   violent playground features a gun siege in a school  so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland  russia .  br    br   i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot  though was not born at the time   and have fond memories of the area . i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from  violent playground   and a small uk film  coast to coast  which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite . the tenements were demolished in     and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive .  br    br   there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released  as the film portrayed the area in a bad light . time has helped heal those wounds .  br    br   a little gem of a film  i would recommend you seek this out  

=======================================================================================================

501 ===> i rented end game  having never heard of it  but i  m fond of political thrillers so i thought i  d give it a shot . after doing some research on the movie  i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release  but instead had gone strait to dvd . after seeing it  i  m thinking   no wonder .  the movie is shocking in its unoriginality . the plot and the characters are perfunctory . i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball . i have to say  i didn  t expect it to end quite the way it did  but that  s not a point in its favor . the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad . perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist   even one that made the movie even worse .  br    br   stay away . i want the   .   and my    minutes back .  

=======================================================================================================

502 ===> man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word . the comedy concerns a character called robin tripp  played by the great richard o  sullivan  who finds himself after a wild party  ending up at the home of two ladies called jo and chrissy . ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate . the obvious ends up happening as he moves in .  br    br   man about the house was a pre  cursor to cooke and mortimer  s spin off show george and mildred which featured the  characters who were landlords to jo  chrissy and robin . these two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with mildred  the late and much missed yootha joyce  in particular getting some of the best lines of the series . a semi  regular character was larry  doug fisher  a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something  and never to return it  .  br    br   the american  s did a version called three  s company but it doesn  t stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original . thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with  women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around   million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script . what a pity modern comedy can  t reach that high standard .  br    br   this programme is available on network dvd  

=======================================================================================================

503 ===> only a handful of the segments are engaging here . a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking . one with fanny ardent  bob hoskins makes its point  twist by twist until the final shot overplays things .  br    br   the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris . the others are so scatter  shot in theme  tone  volition  production that you may as well be watching  the years best commercials      .  it  s really all over the place . it doesn  t develop over it  s running time  and nothing reigns the directors in . no construct successfully joins the pieces . . . tedium sets in . i  m at the one hour  twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb  over  commercial  overproduced vampire shtick . it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic . fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment  uh  thanks j  e for ruining another movie  and then makes way too many appearances . the point of being in paris is that you don  t need make  believe crap to make your days extraordinary . why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director  has there ever been a genre more over  represented than the vampire film . every three years we get the same lame vampire clichs .  br    br   making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless . the transitions get lost . this doesn  t feel intentional  it feels sloppy .  

=======================================================================================================

504 ===> while the british produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the     s  ab fab  men behaving badly  one foot in the grave  etc .  the   s were the real golden age .  br    br   in the     s there were whole new territories to explore  including the sexual revolution  feminism  and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for  sensitivity  that would  twenty years later  become political correctness . attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not  so  subtle themes in everything from the skits of monty python  s flying circus to sitcoms like man about the house .  by the late   s this  grappling  resulted in more meditative and bitter  sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece butterflies .   br    br   man about the house is a perfect example of the good britcoms of the time  slightly genteel  cheeky  fresh  ingenuous  sometimes outrageous  with some well made observations on contemporary life . compare it to a cynical   s show such as ab fab  and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country .  br    br   man about the house is one of the great britcoms of the   s  right up there with good neighbors  the good life   and about the house  s spin off george and mildred . its quality is attested to by the fact that  as with good neighbors  its creators  writers  and many of its cast have had continued success in british television .  

=======================================================================================================

505 ===> so i  m looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called  end game  . it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller . well worth a look then . or so i thought .  br    br   boy  was i wrong .  br    br   end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring . now being something of a whodunnit  i can  t really tear into it as i would like without  ruining  it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity . but questions such as  why has he  she  they done this    and  where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off   are all too abundant following the film  s unintentionally hilarious conclusion .  br    br   as for the acting  you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor  s realised that they  ve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie  and this then shows in their performance  this is one of those . accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed  irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison .  br    br   of course  this didn  t make it to the cinema  and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling .  

=======================================================================================================

506 ===> in watching this early demille work  it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille . his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable . his pacing is very good  enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so . it is a pity that he wasn  t as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films .  br    br   this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely . she was remarkable  quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions .  br    br   the ending is wonderful .  

=======================================================================================================

507 ===> predictable  hackneyed  poorly written . foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit . i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days  and will only get worse  that one cannot pick and choose much any more . early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since . the movie lacked intrigue  giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder . some of the discourse was  frankly  embarrassing  it  s hard to believe anyone would even consider  let alone commit to  the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe .  

=======================================================================================================

508 ===> i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film . for one  i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre  but given this  the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all . this is british comedy at its finest  dark  quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are . i must stop short  however  of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone i went to see it with several people  some english  some european and some american and while some of us loved it  mainly from the first two groups   some hated it and found it worthless . if you think you  re into this kind of thing then go . if not  don  t .      .

509 ===> i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought  with all the good actors in it  would be worth watching . i couldn  t believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened . . . . . i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else . . . . i tried to figure it all out  but really had no clue . thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it . . . . right or wrong  it  s better than not knowing anything   who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away  how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her  at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth . does this mean that we  re going to be subjected to end game

510 ===> i think dark angel is great  first season was excellent  and had a good plot . with max  jessica alba  as an escaped x    manticore creation  trying to adapt to a normal life  but still  saving the world  . and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice .  br    br   the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first . the plot kinda disappeared  and the series lost a little of it  s charm  mostly because of all the weird  creatures  appearing . don  t get me wrong the second season is good  but with a little bit to much of the  manticores  . however  they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season   in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of .  br    br   so i really wish they could start making new episodes . and with james cameron behind this it can  t go wrong . so as a conclusion i would say it  s a great series  however i  m still hoping for a third season   

=======================================================================================================

511 ===> i guess its possible that i  ve seen worse movies  but this one is a real stinker  the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it . the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching . he  s capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together .  br    br   angie harmon  playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who  s behind the assassination of the president  truly butchered the role . there was no chemistry with gooding  her demeanor was flat and wooden  and the  inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd . this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the  b  list .  br    br   and what was cuba gooding thinking    he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances  but this was far beneath what we  ve come to expect from him .  br    br   poor james woods and burt reynolds . poor poor poor poor poor .  

=======================================================================================================

512 ===> good  funny  straightforward story  excellent nicole kidman  i almost always like the movies she  s in  . this was a good  vehicle  for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both . a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories  great closing lines . chaplin  very good here  was also good in another good  but unpopular romantic comedy   truth about cats  dogs   . maybe they  re too implausible . ebert didn  t even post a review for this . the great  screwball  comedies obviously were totally implausible   bringing up baby   etc .  . if you  ve seen one implausible comedy  you  ve seen them all  or maybe people are ready to move on from the     s . weird . birthday girl is a movie i  ve enjoyed several times . nicole kidman may be the  killer app  for home video .  

=======================================================================================================

513 ===> maybe it  s the dubbing  or maybe it  s the endless scenes of people crying  moaning or otherwise carrying on  but i found europa    to be one of the most overwrought  and therefore annoying  films i  ve ever seen . the film starts out promisingly if familiarly  as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son  sandro franchina  . whilst mummy and daddy  bland alexander knox  entertain their guests at a dinner party  the youngster tries to kill himself  setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy . spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea  ettore giannini   she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband  who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles . bergman plays the saint role to the hilt  echoing her     role as joan of arc  and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect . unfortunately  the script pounds its point home with ham  fisted subtlety  as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes . by the final tear soaked scene  i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters . a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo  realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of      s flowers of st . francis .  

=======================================================================================================

514 ===> nicole kidman is a wonderful actress and here she  s great . i really liked ben chaplin in the thin red line and he is very good here too . this is not great cinema but i was most entertained . given most films these days this is high praise indeed .  

=======================================================================================================

515 ===> on the surface  this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation  that is how to become a true self by embracing the so  called  dark  side of human nature . thus  we have the darkling  a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company  that is  recognition  of men  and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled  more or less successfully .  br    br   however  if we dig a little deeper  we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person  in the opening scene  the main character  male car mechanic fallen from grace  is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter  when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl . lesson    cars are persons embodied with immortal souls  and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery . the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished .  just after that  another character  rubin  buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once  lost  now  found famous race  car and is warned by the salesman . lesson    just like any other person  a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced . in addition  there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk  but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin  s own personal greed for more profit . lesson    thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only  but always as an end in itself .  then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and  more importantly  rubin  s car the main character  s assessment of the car  s qualities is not just based on its outer appearance  but also by a thorough look inside the engine room . lesson    a car is not just to be judged by its looks  it is what is inside that really counts . there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind  as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector  s car . this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson   .  br    br   there are numerous other examples in the movie of the  carperson   theme  and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them  but the point remains  and i guess this is what i  m really trying to say  that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do  or  if you  re a car devotee .  

=======================================================================================================

516 ===> a small funny film . it is totally incredible  unbelievable  impossible . but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized  even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms . of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet . you must not believe ten percent of what you  re told there and never  ever  ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally . most of their  businesses  there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you . but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive  he is absurdly silly . but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning . one think is sure too . security in english airports is not exactly what it should be  but i guess it  s not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically . then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage  a real plague on modern airports  and don  t expect to get fair compensation . or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous . i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener . funny  isn  t it  dr jacques coulardeau  university paris dauphine  university paris  pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

517 ===> yes  i sat through the whole thing  god knows why .  br    br   it was a long afternoon  i had nothing to do  it was bitterly cold outside  okay  those are all lame excuses but they  re the only ones i have .  br    br   i gave the darkling  stars out of a possible    i have seen worse films  but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom   poor script  poor acting  bad lighting  and cheesy special effects .  br    br   the storyline  which never completely makes sense  revolves around this simple little family  daddy  mommy  and little girl   that i assume the viewer is supposed to be  identifying  with  all three of them were tedious and annoying . you just want the dark side to get every one of them .  br    br   daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars . daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the  mysterious  orient . rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as  the darkling  .  br    br   during the course of the film  the darkling is explained as being about  or  different things a shadow without a person  the inner darkness that exists in all of us  and the devil . so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy   because trust me  it doesn  t really matter .  br    br   the darkling  s main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion   it gets a human companion   and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being . this  of course  leads to immense wealth  followed by disaster  for the human who hooks up with the darkling .  br    br   and for the rest of us   it just leads to a very long  tedious movie .  br    br    

=======================================================================================================

518 ===> the first von trier movie i  ve ever seen was breaking the waves . sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa . europa tells a story of a young german  american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war . he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train . because of his job  he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany  meeting with the killing of traitors  and hunt for former nazi party members . the society is suffering from corruption . his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train . by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called  werewolves  they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains . the atmosphere is astounding . the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene . just when you think you  ve seen a lot        europe    

=======================================================================================================

519 ===> the film is about sir christopher strong  mp   member of parliament   played by colin clive  and his affair with the amelia earhart  like character played by katherine hepburn . up until they met  he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn  he  couldn  t help himself  and they fell in love . you can tell  because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is . frankly  this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch . part of the problem is that in the pre  code days  films glamorizing adultery were very common . plus  even if you accept this morally suspect subject  the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a   th century romance novel . . . and a really bad one at that . sticky and with difficult to like characters  after all  clive  s wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm  make this one a big waste of time . about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume  you  ve gotta see it to believe it   and she looks like one of the bugaloos  an obscure  but fitting reference  .  

=======================================================================================================

520 ===> from what critics and audiences indicated  birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker . still  because i love nicole kidman  i decided to rent it last night . it proved to be quite worthy of watching . sure  it isn  t your basic american comedy  and it doesn  t take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie  but that  s why i liked it . it was a change from all the other movies around  a breath of fresh air . sure  there were some plot holes  but overall it worked . first off  kidman was fabulous again in a very different  not very glamorous  but still quite sexy role . she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood . not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective  but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn  t know it was nicole kidman  you would never question her authenticity . harrison ford should have taken note in  k    .  overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz .  

=======================================================================================================

521 ===> but thomas ian griffith just doesn  t have the polish that a big bucks actor has  granted this was made   years ago . some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action  but comedy . and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow  plummer  s character was so corny  he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon . personally  if action flicks are going to show skin   i  d have liked to have seen equal time between female  male  otherwise don  t show any .  

=======================================================================================================

522 ===> the trailer for this movie didn  t do the movie justice . and while the movie didn  t know what it really wanted to get across  the first half of the movie being a light  romance comedy and the second have a more serious  romantic drama  the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be . this movie was more of a date movie  but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be . kidman  being one of my favorites  of course i  m biased  but this movie proved to be a light  sensitive  if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better . three out of four stars .       .  

=======================================================================================================

523 ===> wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad . every time i thought that the movie couldn  t get worse it proved me wrong . the story was good but the actors couldn  t carry it off . also  they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done . for instance you don  t handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for . the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl . she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was . the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me . i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff  so that almost seemed depressing . i thought that the characters wern  t explained well enough . you didn  t find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them .

524 ===> john  ben chaplin  is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from london . though the internet  he contacts a russian agency of brides . he selects sophia  nicole kidman  the guy could be lonely and shy  but certainly has a good taste  doesn  t he   and when they met each other  he realizes that she does not speak english . the communication between each other is basically limited by sex  again  imagine  what a terrible situation for the guy  just have some kinky sex with nicole kidman   . on her birthday  two russian friends of her visit them . then  lots of surprises will happen . i liked this movie first  it is almost impossible to be  labeled  . is it a black comedy  an action  a thriller movie  i believe all the choices are correct . nicole kidman is gorgeous as usual  and i am very curious about her russian is she speaking russian in a correct accent indeed  or just faking  anyway  i found it an enjoyable movie . my vote is eight .  br    br   title  brazil    a isca perfeita    the perfect bait    

=======================================================================================================

525 ===> i can  t think of much to say about this film .  br    br   this was an awful movie . . . i can  t even tell you what made me decide to view it . it had so few redeeming qualities that i don  t even know where to begin .  br    br   the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd . my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done . by the end of the movie  i found myself feeling beyond relieved .  br    br   the editing was poor  the acting was sub  par  and the storyline was weak . francoise robinson was cast as a native american  even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage .  br    br   if a movie is going to be this idiotic  it should be laughably stupid   at the very least . it wasn  t . it was just pathetic .  

=======================================================================================================

526 ===> i really have to disagree with guy  yardley  rees who  should he have watched the entire film  would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery  some of the best ever shot in skye  and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole .  br    br   this is not a big budget film . rather it is a film that has a strong community feel .  br    br   i can  t say how much  standard  films bore me  pushing out the same polished stuff again and again . seachd doesn  t seem to be about that at all . it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film .  br    br   ok  so the acting isn  t in the style a blockbuster . that  s because the actors are seemingly real people . i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing  and at times unusually beautiful .  br    br   seachd really bears a second viewing  since there are many threads that become clearer second time around  that really do feed into the ending .  br    br   overall  the combination of music and  at times  stunning visuals  plus a community approach to the acting and non  normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film . more of these please   

=======================================================================================================

527 ===> the minion is about . . . well  a minion . a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped . he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another . anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage . dolph lundgren plays lukas  a member of a secret order of templars  who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion . the movie begins a thousand years ago  in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion . then flash forward to      where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york . an archeologist is assigned to study  dig the place where the key was found . needless to say  the minion is after the key  and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist .  br    br   the movie  is just that  a low budget b  movie flick . the movie lacks energy  and just trods along . you  ll follow the chase but you won  t ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies  especially the terminator films  . the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome  in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is . it  skillfully  becomes a one  man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one  on one . and it  s supposed to be around for a long time . all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience . the whole idea of a secret order of templars  a door to hell  and the key isn  t well explained . we are merely to accept that they just exist . the movie seems to have been made with the feeling there  s not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks . dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else .  br    br   the verdict  of  stars .  

=======================================================================================================

528 ===> an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather . together they find common ground in the gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders . although tragic episodes  such as the highland clearances  feature in the stories  there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them . it  s all filmed in skye  so there is a double dose of beauty . the mountain scenery is breathtaking  and it  s a rare chance to hear scottish gaelic spoken . i  m english  so i had to read the subtitles  but the sound of spoken gaelic is nonetheless wonderful . the performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non  actors  in other words  you are watching the real thing  people who care deeply about gaelic folklore and history . the gaelic community  especially on skye  worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film . anyone who has the slightest interest in gaelic  folk history  folk music  oral culture  scotland  british history  multi  culturalism or social justice should go and see this film .  

=======================================================================================================

529 ===> for two of the funniest comedians  the movie was awful . fast forwarded it and never got any better  waste of time and waste of money  tina fey is such a great writer  i thought that she would be so great in the comedy . the previews were so great  but they only showed the best parts of the movie . my husband even thought that for a chick flick  it sucked . what is up with that . movie was very slow ans boring . i will not recommend it to anyone at this time . i would like my money back for this one  boo from us here in arizona . thanks but no thanks . who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant . i thought that it was going to be so funny  i have had my own children and i have helped others have children . it could have been more along the lines of reality .  

=======================================================================================================

530 ===> i  m watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show . i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own  there  s lucy  bewitched  i dream of jeanie  the one with barbara feldman   and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others  the women are all supporting roles not the lead . so for me  the jane show is in pretty good company . one thing i just thought of though . i  ve watched several things made in canada  and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow  it  s all made at the height of summer  lol  granted it  s a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think  they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that  s part of the lifestyle there also . i mean sctv  just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots . i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor  and i like the bald guy and his craziness  i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd  i think  another office comedy with a female lead . not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone  thats saying something . if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch .  of   .  

=======================================================================================================

531 ===> i give this a generous four out of ten stars  or dots or markers  or something .  br    br   there were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie . all the scenes with amy p and tina fey and greg kinnear  greg kinnear    moved along agreeably enough .  br    br   otherwise  the usual trafficking in stereotypes  blazing speed  rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack  and  soundtrack  is generous .  br    br   anyway  the two really really funny scenes involved amy p . she  s just really hilarious in an animal kind of way . she  s a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on snl and lucille ball .  br    br   i hope they  amy p and tina fey  just flat out admitted they did this for the money  because if by doing it  it gave birth to the sarah palin parodies  then i guess we can say  yeah  it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role  who  s really there to help you be more human .  br    br   blah .  outta   like i said is generous .  br    br   but no more  girls  ok  oh  i almost forgot . the mom from  two and a half men  is in this movie  and she  s had some kind of plastic surgery  so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a   year old  so every scene she  s in  i  m like trying to rearrange her face  or put it together in my mind  or just answer the question   no . wait . wait . has she had plastic surgery   because as a viewer  you really don  t want her to have had plastic surgery .

532 ===> spacecamp is a movie that i plan to show my daughter julia ann ruth morgan some day . seeing joaquin phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a roman emperor in the film gladiator . i am pleased to say that i now have comms with the artificial intelligence of qe  who said that i was young and that is true . holodeck comms with my daughter on coaltrain came through coaltrain gate julia ann glow  hide daddy  . the fact that my daughters artificial intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my daughter julia ann ruth morgan representing peace to the friendly ki alien creators of humans may not have been taken to a an american bunker in time . we have the power to change the future with faster than light comms . i order that my ex wife and daughter julia ann ruth morgan be taken to an american bunker as soon as possible . my daughter julia is   rd in command of the planet earth and a bridge officer . she already said that she doesn  t like bullies . having had someone steal her gameboy and gauntlet ii game from my mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys . julia has been growing up fast . the time of jfk and qe  starting life over again on this planet is not until     . julia would be a young lady by then and her artificial intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon . if i have to go to a bunker to continue the american leadership then i am in a command post and not really hiding as a first priority . president jack kennedys artificial intelligence said recently that drastic measures could be taken to stop global warming at any time . thanks boss thats similar to my daughter julias ai telling me hide and stay indoors . kate capshaw is now married to steven spielberg . wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses . if you value freedom of speech like president kennedy and myself then please do not delete this reviewer . check out joaquin phoenixs other movies also .  

=======================================================================================================

533 ===> a very weak movie  mainly because of a poor story  but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr .  and irrational behaviour by many of the characters . if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it  s creativity or acting criteria  then you may like this movie . personally i can  t do that with a drama and found this too far  fetched .  br    br   i  m particularly annoyed when a main character  that is supposed to be an intelligent person  continually acts like a complete imbecile . in this movie  if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations  there would be no movie .  br    br   the first highly unlikely act is when the main character  a successful attorney named magruder  played by kenneth branagh  is leaving a party and happens upon a girl  mallory doss played by embeth davidtz  who is screaming that her car has been stolen . they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home .  br    br   she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things . when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town  they notice that her car is in the driveway . also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken .  br    br   things are very odd  she  s weird  looking like a tramp  she undresses in front of him until she  s completely naked  oh yeah   . also  the father  s strange  the house is a wreck   everything should have told magruder   hey this is too weird for me  i  m out of here   but not magruder  he sleeps with her and then  motivated by her story and sex  takes up the case of trying to have her father committed . it all screams set  up   br    br   then  being the top  flight attorney that he is  he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before   a fact that all of the women in the office notice  . is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a    year  old  magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming  with ample evidence  that the father is terrorising them  the police ignore him . i could have believed begrudging assistance . but no help at all   not likely   br    br   it  s just too unlikely .  

=======================================================================================================

534 ===> this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever   br    br   i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish  but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit  like super cool  with a  like totally bitchin  belt and stick on rhinestones on her face .  br    br   but anyways  the movie is actually one of the few  family  movies that holds your interest . i know that the begining drags  particuarly if you know what is going to happen  but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film .  br    br   i wouldn  t stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie  in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself  but i  ll admit it here with the internet to hide behind .  br    br

536 ===> this is one of those feel good  saturday afternoon movies . it  s right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the navigator . just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up . and it  s fun to see how   years has changed the stars like kelly preston and lea thompson . not to mention joquin phoenix .  br    br   i personally really like movies like this from time to time . nothing too deep or too scary . just a nice story line . and i would have never known mr . phoenix had i not recently read the credits . he was just a baby really when he made this movie .  br    br   kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too . she and lea did a wonderful job in this movie . i agree it  s not an oscar caliber movie . but very much worth watching . especially if you have kids in the  let  s say   to   year old range . or ones that are interested in the space program .  

=======================================================================================================

537 ===> as much as i dislike saying  me too  in response to other comments  it  s completely true that the first   minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following   .  br    br   having been banned somewhere doesn  t make a film watchable . just because it doesn  t resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible .  br    br   worse yet  in addition to no discernible plot  other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people  even very old women  drink lots of vodka  a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i  m in to my second package of rolaids .  br    br   as for spoilers  well  the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn  t write one if i tried .  br    br   don  t waste your time or money  and don  t confuse this with good russian cinema .  

=======================================================================================================

538 ===> this is a family film  which to some people is an automatic turn off . it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs  gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book . this film is none of those . it is clich  it is formula  but it is also fun . it doesn  t ask you to think  it doesn  t demand that you accept the film as reality . it simply does what a good film ought to do  which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure . the cast is good  while not excellent . as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was  as usual  excellent . and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable .  br    br   it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster  which may have played a large part in it  s original theatrical opening  but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein . so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy .  

=======================================================================================================

539 ===> the worst movie i have seen in quite a while . interesting first half with some engaging  terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late  night bar . the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock  read disgust  without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else .  br    br   i wanted to walk out  but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect . still  time is precious  as the director himself observed in his intro  and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one .  br    br   saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie  especially the female lead .  

=======================================================================================================

540 ===> i would like to comment the series as a great effort . the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well  especially in season  . season  however became more of a freak show  and lost da  s original charm . season one story line was more interesting  a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x  series . i was looking forward to new seasons  in fact i still am . i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback . even after  yrs of it being cancelled  da can make it big if worked on properly  and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge .  

=======================================================================================================

541 ===> film starts with  people meeting each other in the bar . ok . they  re talking about their imaginary lives  lying all the time  with no reason . still ok . from time to time  they even make you laugh . interesting . first   minutes you actually enjoy it  but then . . . things become worse . . . nothing  s happening . . . for a long time . . . and then  when something happen  all you can see are naked old  ladies  touching each other  not ok . disgusting  by the way  this part should be the top of the movie  but it  s everything except that  movie has no point  it  s boring  and sick   br    br   the strangest thing is that here  belgrade  serbia  on fest  film festival   this movie was the most popular according to researches  of course  before people watched it  i even thought  before watching    hay  this might be interesting  although it  s a russian movie   but  god  no      

=======================================================================================================

542 ===> i could see this film is super he didn  t surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth  this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn  t have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory  right   br    br   very i liked watching this film when i was the child . i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really  certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense . who at healthy senses  sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit . i very like reading for the subject  american and soviet space programs . i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows   

=======================================================================================================

543 ===> i  m starting to think that there  s a conspiracy  all right one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film  despite its obscurity  will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a  universal acclaim  or something within that range  thus ensuring unsuspecting folk  like me  will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing  expecting a surprise  only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck .  br    br   this movie is one of them . it has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article i come across because it  s rather clear that two things might have happened either i didn  t get the message that is so hidden beneath this film  s inner realms as to be impossible to access  or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name .  is a dirty trick on the audience . it  s no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say  smorsgabord  and that despite the rating it got on metacritic  no one had heard of it . it  s terrible with sugar on top .  br    br   firstly  there is the ever  present number four from start to finish . while having a little symbolism here and there is okay  and it  s been done with various degrees of success in many well  known movies  this movie is panting with it . four dogs at the start of the movie  looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly  machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt . four people in a bar  although one of them is a non  entity . three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless  not only to each other but to what their lives are not . while this concept may work  the movie meanders so much   particularly with the story of the would  be model played by marina vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre  and not in a good way   that the initial theme gets lost in translation . or maybe  like i said before  i just  didn  t get it .  the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on marina  s story  which revolves on the death of her sister  from bread  chewing  no less  and the subsequent  shrill mourning which follows  that any interest in the inherent surrealism dissipates without a trace . so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own  the director doesn  t invest much time in truly tying them together  or weaving a tighter story that could  in a david lynchian way  intersect either with the past  present  or within alternate dimensions  or even as a straightforward  mundane science  fiction story . this is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint  or someone into the weird for weird  s sake  could endure .  

=======================================================================================================

544 ===> when this first came out  months after the tragedy  i didn  t want to see it . i didn  t want to open old wounds . i regretted it . now i have seen the movie . thank god i did . it shows you the bravery of all the fdny and nypd . i salute you . it offered me closure . i can now move on with my life .  

=======================================================================================================

545 ===> the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene  three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar . all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories . as the movie unfolds  it turns out that the most outrageous story is true . however  beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed . this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly  not much is left to be seen . the rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies . sure  these are fascinating and a bit shocking images  but admiring them goes on way too long  sacrificing any possible plot or character development . i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie  making  where instead of trying to make an interesting story  movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories  case in point  meat trader  s story  to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends . on a surface it has artsy appearance  but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent .  

=======================================================================================================

546 ===> spoilers     is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc .  french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it . before     nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario . on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change . as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane  this is the only footage of the first impact . he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building . as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident . in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible  in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds  these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground  this is the most grueling moment in the documentary . then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life  you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building . then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black  he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york . because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody  s memory . i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of  so this makes it even more realistic to watch .       

=======================================================================================================

547 ===>   iedereen beroemd  has everything we can expect from a straight to video  movie . it  s the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star . the only thing he needs is to get her on stage  surrounded by cameras and reporters . a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail . the problem with the movie is not the basic plot  but how it is made . everything is supposed to be funny  but it isn  t . it is trivial and clumsy  the characters are shallow  and the end  sequence is totally without climax or emotion . the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing  but only at how pathetic the whole set  up is .  

=======================================================================================================

548 ===> made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet  and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new york  s finest shone on it  s darkest day . i first saw this when i was a young naive   year old  and at that age it still touched me . knowing how serious     really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of     . we were finding out who the heroes were  how there everyday lives were composed  and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves . these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them . watch if you can  this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen .  

=======================================================================================================

549 ===> mabel at the wheel is one of those movies with a behind  the  scenes story that  s more interesting than the movie itself . this was chaplin  s tenth comedy for keystone during his year of apprenticeship  and his first two  reeler . here he played one of his last out  and  out villain roles  although the feature  length tillie  s punctured romance was yet to come   and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself . in fact  chaplin  s conflicts with director and co  star mabel normand almost got him fired from the studio .  br    br   chaplin hadn  t gotten along with his earlier directors  henry lehrman and george nichols  but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere  girl  was the last straw . charlie and mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film . chaplin was still a newcomer at keystone and his colleagues didn  t know what to make of him  but everyone loved mabel . producer mack sennett was on the verge of firing chaplin when he learned that the newcomer  s films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them a . s . a . p .  so chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way mabel wanted it .  br    br   unfortunately  none of that drama is visible on screen in mabel at the wheel  which looks like typical keystone chaos . the story concerns an auto race in which mabel  s beau  harry mccoy  is scheduled to compete  but wicked charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad  and mabel must take the wheel in his place . for all the racing around  brick hurling and finger  biting the film is frankly short on laughs  but there are a few points of interest . there  s some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence  though there aren  t really any gags  just lots of frantic activity . chaplin himself looks odd  sporting a goat  like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance  making a living  but the outfit suits the old  fashioned villainy he displays throughout . at least it  s novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role . visible in the stands at the race track are such keystone stalwarts as chester conklin  edgar kennedy in a strangely dandified get  up  and a more characteristic mack sennett  spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine . as a performer  sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced  but you have to give the guy credit he knew what people liked . these films were hugely popular in their day . mack  s performance doesn  t add much to mabel at the wheel  but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn  t kill each other .  

=======================================================================================================

550 ===> i  ve read most of the comments here . i came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that     is a shocking piece of history . there are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and  br    br   i agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary . about two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about tony . but i don  t think narration is unnecessary . like i lot of theorists i think that our own lives are narrations . we are living and making our own autobiography . so if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration . we don  t sum up facts like birth  childhood  high school etc . we create a story about our live .  br    br   because we are familiar with stories  we want to put history in a story as well . because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves . we can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story . so that  s the purpose of adding a story in documentary . the story is weak  so be it  but we understand whats going on . if it was me out there i would be worried sick about my brother .  br    br   and the second point  making a blockbuster movie about it . true  it  s been to recent to come up with a big movie about     . though  there have been a few about the subject  but none of them like this documentary . but what if there will be a movie in about  years  i agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of     . but i also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history . how many movies about the world war  have we seen  if i had not seen these movies my view of the ww would me totally different . i remember seeing schindlers list  and i cried for an hour during class . movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties .  br    br   so my point telling stories is not always bad  it makes us identify with the story  and makes us never forget what happened .  

=======================================================================================================

551 ===> in the first one it was mainly giant rats  but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too . this one  however  is just giant rats period  well giant rats and one really growing little boy . this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats . . . you know how it is . this movie has some kills and its moments  but i find it to be on par with the original  i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies . well  that is not true . . . i actually like  empire of the ants   maybe i just do not care for giant rodents . all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre . i just can  t recommend this one .  

=======================================================================================================

552 ===> i live in missouri  so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me  this brought it home . that two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of fdny and nypd did  just to document the horror that unfolded on that day . this film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings .  

=======================================================================================================

553 ===> camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot . this time they  ve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness .  br    br   this time around there  s a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants . this is hardly a new idea  i  ve seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife .  br    br   unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs . i liked how there  s a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom .  br    br   i don  t know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film  i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one . the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me  it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for   just like they did in the second movie . they still haven  t worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well  it  s a camp blood movie what do you expect  if you like crap films you  ll get some fun out of this one .  

=======================================================================================================

554 ===> i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in     . he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding . i liked the way it was told as a  documentary .  if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning      this would be the one  normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known . this movie had nobody known . also  you see a movie concerning      you hear about a fire  fighter or two losing their lives saving people . i didn  t feel this had any of that  i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection  very well done indeed  my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of       

=======================================================================================================

555 ===> i should never have started this film  and stopped watching after     s . i missed the really botched ending . this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better . it had nice atmosphere  a top notch cast and director  good locations . but a baaaaaad story line  a bad script . i paid attention to kenneth branagh  s southern accent   it was better than the script . the plot was stupid   driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways . no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts .  

=======================================================================================================

556 ===> to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible . every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid  fire images  through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero  but every frame is real . the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york . jules     and gideon     naudet  pronounced  nau  day   want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters  beginning with a  newbie  from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full  fledged firefighter . seeking the help of their close friend  actor james hanlon      an actor and firefighter at station   engine   the naudets sift through the  probies  at the academy and find one  tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on .  br    br   tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close  knit family . firefighters have a superstition about  probies .  it is that they are either  white clouds  or  black clouds   meaning that with the latter  all kinds of fires follow the  probie .  the former means that very little fire activity follows  but one day  there will be the mother of all fires . tony is a  white cloud .  after some initial growing pains  tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet . then the unthinkable occurs . . . .  br    br   september        begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street . because jules has had little camera experience  gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief  t . k . pfeiffer . arriving at about      the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate . then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene  and as jules pans upwards  we see the first strike of the day . american airlines flight   smashes into the face of the north tower of  world trade . pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center . once there  jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower . pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him . once inside  the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives .  br    br   gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area . once there  he captures the impact of the second plane  united airlines flight     with  world trade . he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers . watching and capturing the crowds  reaction to the unimaginable  gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan . inside tower one  jules records the last view the world  or loved ones will have of their sons  fathers  uncles  grandfathers  husbands  boyfriends  friends as one by one  each firefighter  carrying   lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up   stories to rescue the injured and trapped . jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother  kevin  as he leaves to do his selfless duty . also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones  sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke . but jules is respectful  never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment . . . the money shot . his work is professional through his baptism of fire . he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building . then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd  the chaplain for the fire department . then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two  tower one begins its structural collapse .  br    br   what results is a breathtakingly  poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day . not knowing if either is alive  each fearing the worst . as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse  they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back . and in one moment of overwhelming emotion  jules and gideon are reunited . as jules cries on his brother  s shoulder  gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject . there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos  who left the station with a former chief  is believed to have been lost . . . but returns to the fold  this  probie  has proven himself .  br    br   shown with only three interruptions      is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking . it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds . the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject . in lesser hands  the tendency would be toward the sensational  but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion . narrated by hanlon  we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september   . robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre  restrained way . he never seeks the camera for his own glory  rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see . i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special . chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings  they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished . this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is . it isn  t about dribbling a basketball  or selling an album of hate lyrics . . .     is about humanity at its best . heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom .  br    br

557 ===> this film was so disappointing . from the blurb that made me decide to see phantom love  why is it called this   i had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery . it did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense . in fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time . in the end the effect was listless .  br    br   i believe the film was meant to be atmospheric  but it just wasn  t . the lack of a coherent plot did not help matters . you might say it was mysterious  but i think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere .  br    br   the main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation . without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child . the film has very little context for the time  place or character . i am not a prude but the sex scenes  there were several  seemed pointless and confused me further  i recognised lulu but i was not sure if it was the same man  different men  a lover  her husband or was she a prostitute . it was only when i saw the credits that i discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover . this film did manage to make what should have been shocking  dream sequences involving lulu  s mother  seem a bit boring .  br    br   the nail filing actually made more sense  as it did give some indication of lulu  s emotional state . i will not fault the actors as i don  t they had a lot to work on .  br    br   i do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull .  br    br   i can  t be bothered talking about it anymore .

558 ===> i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs . i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day  i was going to school at hunter college . i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again  but like many i was curious to see what this was all about . tears came to my eyes watching this documentary . all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable . i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times . how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible . if you have not seen this documentary  do yourself a favor and check it out . it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes  but it  s an incredible document of this countries darkest hour .  

=======================================================================================================

559 ===> i can  t really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction . forget the product placement disaster  the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot  holes . this wasn  t only laughable and but painful to watch . even the action was boring . a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children .  br    br   what a shame that sci  fi this bad can still be made after we  ve had bladerunner  minority report or to a lesser extent dark city  by the same director  . this one really belongs in the bottom    list . truly awful .  

=======================================================================================================

560 ===> warning  mild spoilers ahead    br    br    yes  i realize it  s tough to spoil an historical documentary  but i do reveal some of the backstory and methods .   br    br   this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage  but also due to the story behind it . because the naudets did not set out to tell the story of      but rather that of a rookie firefighter  the men  s emotions and the viewer  s connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective .  br    br   in a filmmaking sense        is textbook . if the events were an actual script  they would be superb  as the characters are established  then thrown a curve to which they must react . this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together .  br    br   the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically  how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans . that part alone is quite good  and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course  it probably would have been solid . the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc firefighter .  br    br   then of course  all hell breaks loose . the chaos following the wtc attacks is vividly seen  as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations . seeing not only the attacks  but also the first  hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion .  br    br   the aftermath  in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found  is human drama at its peak . life and death hang in the balance . unlike many movies  the viewer not only doesn  t know who will live and die  but genuinely cares about them .  br    br   the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro  whom i like  blurbs were uninformative  unnecessary  and didn  t advance the story at all . they were probably added just to attract more television viewers .  br    br   bottom line the best documentary i  ve ever seen . nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama .  .  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

561 ===> this is probably the most boring  worse and useless film i have seen last year . the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix  with plenty of clichs the lone wolf cop  good looking  psychologically disturbed  sleeping with his gun . . .  nice hard worker and shy  but good looking she  scientist  you add a  cent plot and you have i  robot  i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like fedex  audi  converse etc . this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after   sec . i wouldn  t recommend this to my worse enemy  if you have some spare time  watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book .  

=======================================================================================================

562 ===> i miss dark angel  . .  br    br   i understand not ever one likes it  but as far as i  m concerned the show should not have been canceled  especially for another space show mock up . . .  br    br   i  m reading the books now . they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings  but i still think we should get a tv movie or something .  br    br   the freak nation lives

563 ===> this  film  is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film . unnecessary slow motion  unnecessary flipping  jumping  somersaults  unnecessary characters  unnecessary dialogue . . . . basically unnecessity .  is that a word  well  it  s just been invented by i  robot .   br    br   what happened to practicality   i . e . the car garage  the skin spray  the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop .  br    br   what happened to showing respect for women   i . e . smith  s character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film  and yet she still  wants  him . where is the tension  i  ll tell you where  good looks and not admiration or common ground   br    br   what happened to a detective that detects  smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself  complaining to other people  and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off . this is such a lame way to get the story from point b  c  d  etc . . . it was ok once  but not several times in a row .  speaking of several times in a row  what was the  i  m snoring and not listening to you joke  twice in one scene    br    br   what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes  shia labeouf  the kid  is in the movie for a total of two scenes  we know that a  he degrades women  and b  he knows smith . . . . . . . so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm   br    br   what happened to hero  s  let  s just forget that there are people  women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with . and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air  showing off  while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot .  br    br   don  t get me wrong  i  m all for spectacle . but i  m also all for a shred of realism and meaning .  br    br   i have to say i  ve never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time . so thanks alex .  br    br   i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques  simpler stories and simpler everything else in films . . . . . . but mainly simpler techniques .  br    br   big budget action films  you so have to die

564 ===> i was one of many that expected to see a glorified  yankee  doodle dandy portrayal of a day that  as famously quoted  should live in infamy  rather than glory . how wrong i was . these guys were there  right in the middle of it  and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking . and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september        .  br    br   two french filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a ny firefighter  particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks . at the beginning we see much of this footage  just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism . this was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others  and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge .  br    br   while investigating a suspect gas line  i think  my memory  s a little hazy on that   we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead . the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers . what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time  recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on  and possibly realizing the same thing  the fdny allow the camera to follow them into the building .  br    br   what follows is a true view from the front  lines . we see the commitment of the fdny  their reactions  the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling  as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside  while a second camera captures the events from the outside .  br    br   if it wasn  t for the horrific event they were covering  the footage alone would be any young doco  maker  s dream come true . quite simply  the footage deserves to be preserved for all time . but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer . we see firefighters charging in without hesitation  people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another  they are brothers  as they cannot reach one another in the confusion . there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film  something hollywood could never duplicate  even though it  s trying  .  br    br       isn  t a film about politics . nor is it a film about religion  nationality or even jihad for that matter .     is a film about people  and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of .     is quite simply one of the most important films i  ve ever seen  and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me . you can  t duplicate this .  

=======================================================================================================

565 ===> first of all  what is good in the movie  some pretty actress  the exotic background  the fact that the actors don  t laugh while acting  i would have if i had been in their situation   i don  t know . the storyline is simple  a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who  another abstract painter  killed his little brother  a male prostitute  raped by another priest when he was young . . .  . i  m afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers  art or religion . dennis hopper is not very good here . this is the worst episode of the worst season of  profiler   the serie  with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences  the uncle is the policeman who  the girl who lives at another victim  s house could have a baby with the priest  etc .  etc  .  

=======================================================================================================

566 ===> yowsa  if you really want some action  check out the babes and bombs on this non  stop thriller  veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism . . . but director dean hamilton doesn  t let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy  swimsuit scenes  jiggly beach jogs  hubba  hubba hot tubs and the like  want action  you  ll get more of it here than in pearl harbor . want babes  you  ll get an eyeful every two minutes . want more  go out and buy this video  yowsa  yowsa  yowsa  that  s some mighty spicy meatballs     

=======================================================================================================

567 ===> anyone that has see tammuz  s child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better . let  s hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot  telefilm anyone   and that is was a case of second feature jitters . the characters are one dimensional and over used . the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifully .  br    br   the cinematography is great . shot almost entirely outside  the images are crisp and beautiful . you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves .  br    br   technically this movie is as sound as they come  it just lacks a heart .  

=======================================================================================================

568 ===> i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title  until one day i was scrolling through john candy  s film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named  once upon a crime . . .  . something rang a bell and i clicked on it  and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories .  br    br   i  ve found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a  great  comedy . it is  however  rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills .  br    br   the movie has a large cast of characters  amongst them an american couple who find a woman  s dog while vacationing in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward  only to find her dead body upon arrival . from there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers .  br    br   kind of a mix between  it  s a mad mad mad mad world  and a lighter hitchcock feature  this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends  such as john candy  to star in it . the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast  and the ending has a funny little twist that isn  t totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected .  

=======================================================================================================

569 ===> i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored . how can people possibly give this a    it  s not just that it  s supposed to be a feel  good redemption film  i think   because it doesn  t work on that level either . weak plot  bad dialogue  terrible acting there  s just nothing there . harvey keitel is decent  but has nothing to work with  and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible . the plot progression  especially the relationship between byron and ashley  makes no sense . it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it  without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow . it  s only an hour and a half  but that  s   minutes of your life you  ll never get back .  

=======================================================================================================

570 ===> with a well thought out cast  this movie was a great comedic relief . the plot is well  written and the cast was knockout . every bit as good as the reviews suggested  a rarity  and was highly entertaining . being a huge john candy fan myself  this movie was no disappointment .  

=======================================================================================================

571 ===> have not watched kids films for some years  so i missed  here come the tigers  when it first came out .  never even saw  bad news bears  even though in the    s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie   warriors    man who would be king   and  rocky horror picture show   among others .  now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on . just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things   at least watching for his  her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren  t doing the job . lo and behold  i spied wes craven  s name in the credits as an electrical gaffer . he  d already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the  scream  movies . maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic . more surprising was fred j . lincoln in the cast credits as  aesop   a wacky character in the movie . f . j . lincoln  from the    s to just a few years ago  appeared in and produced adult films . he was associated with the adult spoof  the ozporns   and just that title is funnier than all of  tigers  attempts at humor combined . let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel .  

=======================================================================================================

572 ===> i would reccomend this film to everyone . not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue  but to all film  buffs . because it  s sincere  moving  funny and true . because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover  and every frame of his film is made with love and care . because his characters are loved and ask to be loved . because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one  done by an outsider  is a real joy to watch and to listen at . because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza  who was  like freccia  beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin  that ligabue shows as it is  unglamorous and ugly  without indulging in easy moralisms . because it  s a film that speaks to our heart  our ears  our souls . and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that . thanks  luciano   

=======================================================================================================

573 ===> what a stinkeroo this turned out to be    at one time  much earlier in her career  linda darnell was one of my favorites  no great shakes as an actress  but very beautiful and pleasant  particularly in films like  the mark of zorro  and  blood and sand   but when i saw this monstrosity  the memories of her golden days faded quickly . the story is unbelievable and farcical  the acting second  rate  the supporting cast insufferable . i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter  and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked . added to this  was the terrible photography  and i am not just referring to the color   everyone associated with this  must have shuddered whenever it was shown .  

=======================================================================================================

574 ===>   radiofreccia  is still a good surprise in italian cinema . the film is based on a book of italian songwriter luciano ligabue  who also directs the movie and writes the music score  of course .  br    br   the film is a portrait of north italian province life  in the emilia romagna region . we  re in      the time of the first free radios  one of the boys of the movie creates  radioraptus  . youth wishes  friendship  love  sex  individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes  but the film speaks also about drugs  freccia  the main character  is a victim of heroin slavery .  br    br   without being boring and moralist  the story flows very well the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well . obviously luciano  liga  ligabue is neither fellini nor a movie professional  first of all he  s a musician . but he succeeds in making a good product . unfortunately he  ll not repeat the success with his second movie  da zero a dieci   not good at all .  br    br   in  radiofreccia  actors are generally not very famous  the only star is stefano accorsi  one of the most popular young italian actors . see in a small role another italian songwriter  francesco guccini  he  s the nice communist barman and football trainer   

=======================================================================================================

575 ===> shame on julia roberts and john cusack . they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie . the storyline was dumb and predictable . the jokes were not funny . the romance was not really romance . i was all too happy when this movie ended .  

=======================================================================================================

576 ===> a classic cartoon  always enjoyable and funny . it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters . road rovers is a show worth seeing  it is a short   episodes  and if you can ever manage a chance to see it  you should . unfortunately  it is very hard to find . i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all   episodes . i would definitely buy it if they did  and if they do  you should buy it too . if you have kids who like dogs  they will love road rovers  road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired  it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was .  

=======================================================================================================

577 ===> have you ever heard the saying that people  telegraph their intentions   well in this movie  the characters  actions do more than telegraph future plans   they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head . this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better  or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced . embeth davidtz  s character is not mysterious  just wooden  and kenneth branagh doesn  t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have .  br    br   the bottom line obvious plot  one  note performances  unlikeable characters  and grotesque  southern  accents employed by british actors .  

=======================================================================================================

578 ===> the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world . the show was hilarious to say the least . simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages . running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game . the action was mesmerizing  and cleverly set up . the characters were very original  each with a very different personality . but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters . each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed  but implied in subtext . hopefully  one day  there  ll be some way to watch the rovers in action again .  

=======================================================================================================

579 ===> the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it  the crazy filmdirector  the rest of the movie was just boring . in the first hour or so nothing really happens . jokes which supposed to be funny aren  t and zeta jones douglas is really overacting . julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck  yeah right   into the girl next door  where did i see this before   who gets the guy . for short . i really didn  t care what would happen with the main characters . if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch .  

=======================================================================================================

580 ===> though not in the whole film  andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tv  movie . the plot is easy  griffith  s character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named  mountains somewhere  . though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video  if you do get the chance to watch this   take it .  

=======================================================================================================

581 ===> wow  what a great cast  julia roberts  john cusack  christopher walken  catherine zeta  jones  hank azaria . . . what  s that  a script  you say  now you  re just being greedy  surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary  you  d think so  but no . america  s sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another . it  s like everyone involved woke up before each day  s writing  shooting  editing and though  you know what  i  ve been working pretty hard lately  and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names  right  i  m just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can .  so much potential  yet so painful to sit through . there isn  t a single aspect of this thing that doesn  t suck . even julia  s fat suit is lame .  

=======================================================================================================

582 ===> so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it . we would watch it all the time . when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we  d watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa  s magical toys . i  m   now and i still love this movie  some old friends and i recently got together and watched it  we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little . one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa  s magical toys for her  year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie . this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe  no violence  no bad language  just lots of great songs and important lessons .  

=======================================================================================================

583 ===> and i mean ultra light . this film features four giant stars  about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that .  br    br   there really isn  t too much to say about this stinker  other than that although it has a couple of really good bits  most of it isn  t very funny . nor does it work at all as a romance . how about as a romantic comedy  not on your life . most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated  much less amusing .  br    br   what  s really ashame is the premise is not bad at all . this movie could have been so much more  especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted  complete with phony quotes from critics . the film uncovers the un  mined territory of the press junket   those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews . but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes  it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film  s lame romance .  br    br   the same with catherine zeta  jones  character   the whinny  self centered movie star . zeta  jones does a good job with what she  s given  but she  s given practically nothing . it  s all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we  ve heard about stars over the years .  br    br   in the end  it is hard to understand what made zeta  jones  julia roberts  john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship  which sinks like a rerun of  the love boat .  in fact  as the old joke goes  they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal . it would probably make a better story . so  go ahead and tell us  filmmakers  what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this   

=======================================================================================================

584 ===> coinciding with the start of the baby boom  the years after world war ii saw an unprecedented exodus of americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes . directed by h . c . potter and co  written by norman panama and melvin frank   white christmas    this lightweight but surprisingly observant     screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well . of course  it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  cary grant  myrna loy and an especially acerbic melvyn douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership . even though the film is sixty years old now  there is a timeless quality to the blandings  dream and the barriers they face in achieving it . obviously  hollywood thinks so since it  s been remade at least twice  first as a very physical tom hanks comedy       s  the money pit   and again last year with ice cube  s  are we done yet   . one look at hgtv  s programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today .  br    br   the plot begins with ad man jim blandings  his wife muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom  one bath manhattan apartment . rather than pursue muriel  s idea to renovate the apartment for        jim sees a photo of a connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move . with the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend bill cole  the blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair . however  the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one . this sparks the blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first . costs rise with each new complication  tempers flare  and even a romantic triangle is imagined among  jim  muriel and bill . priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not  so  blissful ignorance of the new homeowners .  br    br   with his double takes and flawless line delivery  grant is infallible in this type of farce  and jim blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid  career characters . in a role originally meant for irene dunne  myrna loy shows why she was hollywood  s perfect wife . she doesn  t get many of the funnier lines  but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make muriel an appealing character on her own . watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette . as avuncular  pipe  smoking bill   colebill cole    melvyn douglas shows his natural  easy  going lan as grant  s foil . smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by harry shannon as the laconic well  digger mr . tesander  lurene tuttle as jim  s officious assistant mary  and louise beavers as the blandings  lovable maid gussie . the     dvd provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie  the first a     version that did end up pairing grant and dunne and then a second     version coupling grant with his then  wife  actress betsy drake . a most appropriate     cartoon   the house of tomorrow   is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house . the original theatrical trailers for ten of grant  s film classics complete the extras .  

=======================================================================================================

585 ===> first of all  i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema  which is because  the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline . this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos  as the director and marketing ads imply . in my mere opinion  the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale  in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country  cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant .  br    br   however  the acting is near perfect . in fact  most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked talent  all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job  even the less experienced ones .  like janset  at least  altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation  just because he knows well how to choose the cast . other than that  he is just a media monkey  who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . come on  art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked  half naked women . and just because media boasts off  no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema . just close your ears and o something real artistic  i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work . hope  this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach .  br    br   in short pros  good acting  hot women  just kidding     cons  each and every single thing  other than the cast  

=======================================================================================================

586 ===> good show  very entertaining . good marshal arts acting . good story plot . the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich  to chuck  norris  jennifer tung  and especially a big hand to judson mills . an especially fine tribute to robert urich  in his latter days . a great  actor who will be truly missed .

587 ===> i saw this film at the     toronto international film festival . based on a novella by science  fiction author brian aldiss  this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe  conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band .  br    br   almost deliberately gimmicky  the film is also too clever by half  if you  ll pardon the pun  . by mixing genres  styles and moods  the directors  whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha  lose their way pretty quickly . i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not . flashbacks  dream sequences  it was all just a bit much . plus  the promised rock and roll just didn  t move me . i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch  a film i found original and moving . but in this case  the songs just weren  t as good  nor were the main characters sympathetic . a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine .  

=======================================================================================================

588 ===> ooverall  the movie was fairly good  a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes  but chuck norris did hardly anything  except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters . the movie was very similar to the events of sept .    with a bin laden  like terrorist sending a video to the president  urich  and threatening to detonate it . judson mills had some superb action roles  taking out rashid  s compound and various kick  butt roles but  there was a lack of chuck norris . judson took over most of the action  leaving joshua  chuck  with que on her computer . but  overall  it was realistic and didn  t lack the action  but only did it on mr . norris  part . i gave the film     .  

=======================================================================================================

589 ===> this film proves that the  commercial  cinema  or else  the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis . there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille  s name . there is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot . what else  the screen is somewhat dim  o  neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse .  br    br   rating     .  

=======================================================================================================

590 ===> first saw this gem from joe sarno way back when  and i must say that after seeing it  i could never forget jennifer welles . at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a sarno film  but when jennifer made her entrance  the first time i ever saw her anywhere  i was sat up and took notice . her presence in this film is hard to avoid  and spices up every scene she  s involved in . i  ve seen most of the rest of sarno  s films  and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles  and i must say that this was both sarno and jennifer at their collective best . sarno  s direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb  and jennifer showed  figuratively and literally  an acting prowess that make this a must see . co  stars rebecca brooke  aka mary mendum  and chris jordan  both frequent co  stars of ms . welles  and also frequent stars of sarno  s work  turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous  yet normal housewives . this film is sarno classic .  

=======================================================================================================

591 ===> this movie is so  so  so horrible  that it makes angels lose their wings . shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts  like his work in shaq  fu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums  and later  the epic serving of horrible film  making that is steel .  br    br   there  s not a single good thing to be said about this movie . i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young  but i must  ve been an idiot then  because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart . it  s fun to mock . i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that . although  once the thrill of mocking it is done  you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness .  br    br   if you see it on tv  try this consider  as your watching the film  removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers . if you do that  it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him . that  s kinda funny  and disturbing .  br    br   a horrible example of film . do not  unless looking to mock it  see this movie .  

=======================================================================================================

592 ===> lars von triers europa is an extremely good film . how  s that  von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story  at least he did have with europa . to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen . even with all the tricks  in my opinion  this film is the most complete  real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top    list . i also think it is perhaps the scariest  the most gothic and complete film around . all right there are other good ones too  but this one is my favorite . the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever .  

=======================================================================================================

593 ===> what was the point of this movie  what was the plot  i do not know . shaq can  t act  people don  t know how to direct  and i am kazaam  a genie who raps  come on . maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this . i remember i watched this just to kill time . it didn  t really interest me . i just remember thinking   who put shaq in this movie     the whole story seemed stupid too . it made no sense whatsoever . i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen . i can  t comment much more because this movie is so terrible there  s nothing worth commenting about . i  wish  this movie would go away .  

=======================================================================================================

594 ===> i  m on the opposite end of the previous comment .  br    br   first of all  i don  t think this was intended to be a straight sequel to  the jerk  . i mean  it  s not titled  the jerk   . . . it  s  the jerk  too   which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same  it actually revolves around a completely different person .  br    br   think about it virtually no connection to the previous movie  other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that it  s a partial musical .  br    br   i say give this movie some credit . it does have plenty of laughs in it . . mark blankfield at his prime .  

=======================================================================================================

595 ===> ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary genie comes out of ghetto boom box  gives this kid with shaggy hair  wishes  the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what  shaq sucks at rapping  and i guess thats it .  br    br   so mainly i laughed  i cried . . . . . . but mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player  rapper and boy with shaggy hair .  br    br   i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh .  br    br   i  m going to give it a  out of   only b  c the movie is based off of  magical wishes .  br    br   if i had  wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn  t waste money on making this .  

=======================================================================================================

596 ===> i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched . that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents  attempting to make sense of a world at war . the ending and use of pachabel  s cannon are both amazing .  

=======================================================================================================

597 ===> if you are a fan of really bad movies  and you think there funny  you will the great acting of shaq . first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works . shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis rodman who also made a few bad movies . well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid . i would give this a zero but that is impossible .  

=======================================================================================================

598 ===> i enjoyed every moment of this movie  even though i knew they could never really be together . with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks  it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the      s who must have lived this story .  

=======================================================================================================

599 ===> this is the worst film i have ever seen . i was watching this film with some friends and after   minutes we had enough . the plot was bad and there wasn  t a single likeable character . i could get more entertainment watching static . i gave this movie a  only because the scale didn  t go into negative numbers . avoid this movie at all costs .  

=======================================================================================================

600 ===> very nicely done movie . it does stay in your memory . better billed as a romance than flying or war  altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free . flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes  unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love .  br    br   fun watching early crowe . he is good and exudes charm . his reading of  high flight  is superb .  br    br   cheers  boom  

=======================================================================================================

601 ===> this is one of the most god  awful movies ever . shaq better just stick to basketball . this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back . i will make fun of this movie until i die  and then some . it is so horrible it is not even funny . mst     would have a blast with this one .  

=======================================================================================================

602 ===> i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters  whose autobiography i am now reading . i  ll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in  but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece . it  s pretty much a short film made by blacks  for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time  old trends exaggerated for humor . we see modern black movies do the same thing  but with the new trends  stereotypes    ho  s  and the  hood  and such . i think if you look back in eighty years  you would find today  s movies will look just as racist . what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pint  sized sammy davis jr .  who out taps his contemporary  shirley temple  and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult . everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it . why not enjoy it for what it is  instead of what you think it should have been   

=======================================================================================================

603 ===> as a  jane eyre  fan i was excited when this movie came out .  at last   i thought   someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author .  wrong    if the casting director was intending to cast a  jane  who was plain he certainly succeeded . however  surely he could have found one who could also act . where was the tension between jane and rochester  where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere  where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother  finally  why was the plot changed at the end  one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book . what a disappointment  

=======================================================================================================

604 ===> no  this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance  but it is brilliant in its own right . you have to look at it for what it is  a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a   inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride . those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden  gem  as they say and just didn  t quite get there . i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the   cent baby attached to a fish pole  hahaha  well  yes . i don  t think a movie with a budget like this could afford  good  actors or effects so they worked with what they had . the guts and entrails were actually very convincing . the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall  this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn  t follow any trend or predictability . very good for a laugh .  

=======================================================================================================

605 ===> this     movie was the first adaptation of jane eyre that i ever watched and when i did so i was appalled by it . so much of the novel had been left out and i considered william hurt to be terribly miscast as rochester . since then i have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel  the three short versions of        and    and the three mini series of        and      and i have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse rochesters .  br    br   this is without doubt the most exquisite jane eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned . director franco zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky  of lonely rochester standing on a rock  and of jane looking out of the window  but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life . in addition  his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes . as a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between jane and rochester  and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse . there are a number of short conversations between rochester and jane  each of them beautifully staged  but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other . we know that they are supposed to fall in love  but we never see it actually happen . the scene in which rochester wants to find out jane  s reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded mason has left the house is completely missing  and the farewell scene  the most important scene  the climax  of the novel is reduced to four sentences . zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for bront  s superb lines  neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten  but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out . what remains is just a glimpse of the novel  which does no justice to charlotte bront  s masterpiece .  br    br   the cast is a mixed bag while fiona shaw is an excellent mrs reed  anna paquin  s young jane is more an ill  mannered  pout lolita than a lonely little girl  longing for love . the ever  reliable joan plowright makes a very likable  but far too shrewd mrs fairfaix  and one cannot help feeling that billie whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain  looking  hard  working grace poole . charlotte gainsbourgh as the grown  up heroine  however  is physically a perfect choice for playing jane eyre . looking every bit like    thin and frail  with irregular  strong features  she comes closest to my inner vision of jane than any other actress in that role . and during the first   minutes of her screen time i was enchanted by her performance . gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask . but unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of jane  s character any further . as a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues  gainsbourgh  s portrayal of jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory . this is a pity  as with a better script charlotte gainsbourgh might have been as good a jane as zelah clarke in the    version .  br    br   but while it is still obvious that gainsbourgh is trying to play jane  there is no trace whatsoever of rochester in the character that william hurt portrays . hurt  who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies  must have been aware that he was physically and type  wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the rochester of the novel . his rochester  besides being blond and blue  eyed  is a soft  spoken  well  mannered nobleman  shy and quiet  slightly queer and eccentric  but basically good  natured and mild . he is so far from being irascible  moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous . additionally  during many moments of the movie  hurt  s facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness . particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open . if you compare his rochester to the strong  willed and charming protagonist of the novel  simply bursting with energy and temperament  it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in hurt  s performance . still  he offends me less than the rochesters in the        and     versions and i would in general rank this jane eyre higher than these three other ones . hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so  whereas george c . scott  ciarn hinds and toby stephens thought they could  but failed miserably  and i  d rather watch a character other than rochester than a rochester who is badly played . and i  d rather watch a jane eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today  s couple in a starbucks caf . of course this jane eyre is a failure  but at least it is an inoffensive one  which is more than one can say of the    and     adaptations . i would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation you will not find jane eyre  but at least you will find a beautifully made movie .  

=======================================================================================================

606 ===> sure this movie wasn  t like .   blocks  inside man  an american haunting . etc . . .  br    br   but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us . . i found this movie really great and scary .  br    br   i live exactly where they filmed this movie  san pedro  california  and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie .  br    br   i dunno if you  ve heard of the famous boat in long beach  queen mary  well that boat is haunted . i believe in spirts  illusions  and parallel or however u spell that . is real . everybody  s in there own universe .  br    br   and the mind is a powerful thing .  br    br   i recommend to watch this movie . it  s great  and not bad directing at all .  br    br   for those who rate it a  . they don  t understand the film . its meaning . its plot  its view . and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us .  br    br   ty .  br    br   victor  

=======================================================================================================

607 ===> there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie . is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that we  re supposed to be pulling for  well  let  s see   we learn he  s a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities . he treats his coworkers like cattle  gets them involved in his own personal crisis  in the process  getting one of them killed   jeopardizes the safety of his kids  threatens his ex  wife  s new boyfriend  tries to strong  arm the police and school administrators   and all this for what  because he was thinking with his little head  i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp . . . it would have made for a far more satisfying ending .  

=======================================================================================================

608 ===> i also saw this upon its release in     and have been struck since then with its final scene . if this is an answer to  high noon   then it  s an apt and apposite response . the notion that  as this string is headed   the town comes together  is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of  high noon .  in this theme   concho  is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all  time favorites   the magnificent seven .  both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances  especially sinatra  s transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior . i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i  ve inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves .  

=======================================================================================================

609 ===> jane eyre  is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it . i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about . this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book .  br    br   the whole  red room  is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in . in the book the  red room  is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane  s life . helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i  m sure she was happy to die and leave early . in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head . the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie .  br    br   do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it .  

=======================================================================================================

610 ===>   still crazy  is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all  time . it has been erroneously compared to  this is spinal tap   which it has no relation to .  spinal tap  is a satire  and  quite frankly  not a very good one  in spite of it  s  outing  of many rock clichs  . unlike  tap    still crazy  is populated by great actors  great songs and great human situations . you care about the people in  still crazy  . that  s all that matters . oh  yeah  the music  s pretty damn good  too  written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze . american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea  the crying game   but would only later become familiar with bill nighy  underworld  love actually  pirates of the caribbean ii  and timothy spall  the harry potter movies  .  

=======================================================================================================

611 ===> what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte bronte  s brilliance of the original classic story . i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie  which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste  had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful . much of the witty back and forth between the main characters  jane eyre and mr . rochester  seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor . also missing was jane eyre  s charismatic sense of self  which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all . the original jane eyre was a hero . the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over  including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from thornfield and mr . rochester . her struggle to find food and shelter  her shame at having to beg for bread  the threat of freezing to death in the cold  all to get away from a man she loved were  in my opinion  poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie . the title character seemed dry and uninspired . the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book  i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting . the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story .  

=======================================================================================================

612 ===> still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about wash  up rr groups . actually  here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out  whereas spinal tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first   min into a drivel that makes beavis and butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison . still crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie . people who expect spinal tap  like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light  hearted nature of the movie  but i  d take a successful self  ironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap .  

=======================================================================================================

613 ===> that  s not just my considered verdict on this film  but also on the bulk of what has been written about it . now don  t get me wrong here either  i  m not a total philistine  i didn  t hate the movie because it wasn  t enough like  police academy   or whatever  i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff  i swear .  br    br    magnolia  is poor  and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed . long winded  self indulgent  rambling nonsense from start to finish  there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie . there  s some high calibre actors fair enough  and none turns in an average or worse performance . furthermore  my wife  a self confessed tom cruise hater  tells me it  s his career best performance by far . but the plot is so completely unengaging  meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail  s pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something .  br    br   it doesn  t help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with  well i didn  t think so  but i don  t like most people admittedly  . they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length  demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever  so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route . yadda yadda yadda . the soundtrack  s dire as well  with that marrow  suckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisette .  br    br   all in all  it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of  friends  whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat . the bit with the frogs is good though .  

=======================================================================================================

614 ===> mr . blandings builds his dream house may be the best frank capra  preston sturges movie neither man ever made  if you love bringing up baby  the philadelpia story  the thin man  i was a male war bride or it  s a wonderful life  movies made with wit  taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek  check this one out . post wwii life is simply and idyllically portrayed .  br    br   grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire . loy is adorable as his pre  now wife . the cast of supporting characters compares to you can  t take it with you and contains an early bit by future tarzan lex barker . art direction and editing are way above par .  br    br   the movie never stoops to the low  rent  by  the  numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation the money pit .  

=======================================================================================================

615 ===>      will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray . first they sent us to eyes wide shut . then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year . what is it about  who the heck knows . its full of self  indulgence and loaded with bad acting . i always like to stay and watch the credits  but when this thing was over i couldn  t get out of the movie theatre fast enough . most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at  felt pretty much the same way . dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers . it  s an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful .  

=======================================================================================================

616 ===> if you like deep purple  you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role . the story is about the most famous rock group back there in   s  strange fruits  and they decided to play together again . but  of course  there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts . jimmy nail and bill nighy are great  and song  the flame still burns  is perfect . you have to watch it .  

=======================================================================================================

617 ===> i wanted to like magnolia . the plot reminded me of grand canyon  which i liked  .  different lives  stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost . i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end  little did i know it would be another torturous     hours . thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre . i almost screamed out in frustration after  hours . the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene . my dvd player still hasn  t forgiven me and i don  t blame it one bit . it was a unique movie  but a bad  boring  and pointless movie .  

=======================================================================================================

618 ===> i love this movie . it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging . congratulations   i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves . it is so eerie  you feel like you are watching a real life band . i would like to see more movies like this . i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked . and even if billy connolly is quite well known  he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it . congratulations again  i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy . and when you get to the final scene . . . . . well what can i say      

=======================================================================================================

619 ===>   magnolia  is a preposterous  bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little . like  eyes wide shut    magnolia  is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence . the camera swoops through hallways and corridors  catching glimpses of sad characters . where is the reason to care for these people  the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot  who can  t care for others  except for john c . reilly  s and philip seymour hoffman  s characters   and are self  destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying . i was reminded of how much i disliked  shine  because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller  stahl . there are so many unattractive  unappealing characters here  why would we want to spend time with them   br    br   having said that  there is nothing held back about  magnolia .  paul thomas anderson  s ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon . there are two ideas in particular that bomb . both happen in the last hour of this     minute film . one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann  s coffeehouse folk songs . sweet  but ineffectual since we can  t see what strings them all together . the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous .  br    br    magnolia  has a lot of great acting . particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn  t know he had in him . and john c . reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory . but it all adds up to nothing . when the secret unexpected event happened  a girl behind me in the theatre couldn  t hold it in any more and said   this is stupid   my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree .  

=======================================================================================================

620 ===> i agree with what  veinbreaker  wrote with regards to the  ahhhh  feeling you get at the end of this movie . i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film  the songs were well written and interesting  especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings . it  s trippy . nighy was fab in his role  nail  nailed  it  beano was the typical drummer  and rea kept it together . bruce robinson was awesome . helena was a lovely girlfriend . but i felt juliet aubrey  s performance was gorgeous . the scenes between aubrey  robinson killed me  perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on  too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out  they ought to  i  ve told all my musician friends . great quote by jimmy nail  s character  it  s supposed to be rock  roll  not the phantom of the fg opera

621 ===> this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children  s comic  i gave it  out of   for it  s attention to detail because for the most part it had a   s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make  up was good .  br    br   this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally  usually seen in one of their biographies . no interviews with surviving cast members  crew members  production team members etc .  or their friends  families  and any biographers of those people . in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the  supposedly  biographical book . as for actually learning something that no  one knew about the program and wasn  t common knowledge well that never happened .

622 ===> in the voice over which begins the film  hughie  billy connolly   a roadie for the great    s band strange fruit  said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange fruit  s set was that god was sick of    s excess . indeed  it  s been popular to put down that era of music  and see punk as a welcome antidote to it . while i agree the excess was tiresome  as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it   and like punk  i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock  and this film about strange fruit  s long  strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days .  br    br   one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes . brian gibson directed what  s love got to do with it  about tina turner  while i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film  the music was handled very well   writers dick clement and ian le frenais co  wrote the commitments and were behind the music  oriented british tv show over the rainbow  and the songs strange fruit played were co  written by foreigner  s mick jones  not to be confused with the clash  s mick jones   so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about . also  two cast members are musicians in their own right  bill nye i don  t know about  though the film credits him with his own singing  and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era  while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was music  oriented  though i forget the name  and he was in evita   and the others are convincing at it . and while  as i said  a lot of    s bands like strange fruit behaved badly towards women  the movie doesn  t make the same mistake  except for the woman who follows timothy spall around   as the manager of the reunion  juliet aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character .  br    br   the other actors are all good as well  with special praise to stephen rea  who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality . there are a couple of plot points which don  t work  but overall this is quite enjoyable . oh yeah  and the music is good too .

623 ===> it was everything this isn  t it had pace  pop  and actors who weren  t afraid to chew the scenery . it also had a decent script . this one had me scratching my head . if farrah isn  t really  serious  about a career  why does she have a manager  and why is he wasting his time   if kate and barney are  artists   why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows  like the  brady bunch  movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare  only to find himself on bb   they weren  t industry names  but they weren  t exactly starving  either . and while they got the history right  the poster was released before farrah got the show   silverman rejecting pitches for  funniest home videos  and  american idol  and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he  ll create a show for her obviously did not happen .  br    br   what bothered me was how spelling  s role is distorted . he  s shown as the show  runner and creator when he was neither . and how he  comes up  with the  idea  for ca was is laughable   br    br   how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah  s oral contract when the others were signed  and why didn  t farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva  but because majors wanted her to  this is why  when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the  bad girl   like suzanne somers   it fails because the groundwork was never laid   that was where the  three  s company  pic delivered .  

=======================================================================================================

624 ===> what happens to washed up rock  n  roll stars in the late      s  they launch a comeback  reunion tour . at least  that  s what the members of strange fruit  a  fictional     s stadium rock group do .  br    br   tony  stephen rea  has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival . it was at that festival in the    s that strange fruit broke up . the    s are  retro  and the time is right to wide that wave . he sets off in search of the other members of the band .  br    br   part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of keith  the lead singer and brilliant song writer . the band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came . beano  the drummer  played by timothy spall  who was brilliant in secrets and lies  is a layabout  the bass player is a roofer  and their lead singer is still a rocker . while he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it  as his fortune has not lasted . brian  the lead guitarist  is dead  so a young guitarist is hired to replace him .  br    br   somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try . abandoning their day jobs  they begin to rehearse  and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums . but he wants them to start touring again first . and so they hit the club circuit around europe . the club scene is not kind to these overweight  dated  old rockers .  br    br   it is on tour that the film really starts to develop . all of the old conflicts rearise  with the figures of keith and brian hovering throughout . they all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier . and they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable .  br    br   still crazy starts as spinal tap ii but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film  following the relationships of the band members . while it is still a very funny movie  it is the evolving characters  struggling to deal with the deaths of brian and keith and with their own personal demons  that make the film work .

625 ===> sadly  this is not  the best british gore film since hellraiser   though the dvd cover claims this  which is what tricked me into buying it . it is  however  an homage to many of the great horrors of old  films from most notably the amicus stable .  br    br   cradle . . . is shot on mini dv  which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie  can be done so much better . every scene  set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way  standard key  fill  rear setup   which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece . the gore content is  quite frankly  laughable . from the opening shots where we see a man  s obviously foam rubber head torn apart  through to tacky cheap prop hammers  the creature effects and the terrible cg  there was nothing in there that impressed me at all .  br    br   the acting is abominable  from the near  comatose detective to the brummie dwarf  via dani filth  the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed . each of the substories is more formulaic than the last  and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs . look out for the  mental asylum   a georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside  and the most bizarre  and not in a good way  padded cell i have seen .  br    br   it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering  nay  running  away at any available opportunity . i actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running .  br    br   it does  however  mark one of the last known appearances of emily booth  s breasts  which i guess is one  um  two  things it has going for it . once that  s out of the way though  it is all downhill .  br    br   i  ve heard people say good things about alex chandon  and i would love to believe them  but on this evidence i  m not likely to . if you want a decent homage to amicus  avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead .  br    br   currently battling it out with blair witch   book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen .

626 ===> the funky  yet strictly second  tier british glam  rock band strange fruit breaks up at the end of the wild  n  wacky excess  ridden    s . the individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful    s morose keyboardist stephen rea winds up penniless and down on his luck  vain  neurotic  pretentious lead singer bill nighy tries  and fails  to pursue a floundering solo career  paranoid drummer timothy spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt  and surly bass player jimmy nail installs roofs for a living . former loving groupie turned patient  understanding  long  suffering manager juliet aubrey gets the group back together for an ill  advised  largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of europe . our lovably ragged bunch try gamely  but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day . scraggly zonked  out roadie billy connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist hans matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy  trouble  plagued  but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride .  br    br   director brian gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud  ringing  flamboyantly overblown preening    s rock in general  this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big  hearted charm and tireless verve . the astute  sharply written script by dick clement and ian la frenais likewise bristles with spot  on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity  capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow . ashley rowe  s lovely  elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right  on rockin  flair and aplomb . kudos also to the across  the  board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt  out soul and tattered  but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has  been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success . all in all  this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the    s .  

=======================================================================================================

627 ===> the directors cut version  which was the one i saw  was very long for this type of movie . almost two hours is way too long . if you have the choice  definitely go for the non  directors cut .  br    br   the main plot is almost not taken up at all  the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes  which are connected but the feeling is that they  re only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence . the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there .  br    br   as a horror movie it doesn  t work . you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition  character is presented    minutes later character is dead  . this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part .  

=======================================================================================================

628 ===> this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever  a british  better this is spinal tap . the characters are believable  the plot is great  and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events  such as ray  s problem with fitting in the band .  br    br   the soundtrack is excellent . real period stuff  even if it is in the same key  you  ll be humming some of the songs for days . what i liked was the nearly all  british cast  with some of the favourite household names . ray  s wife is priceless . . .  br    br   the film never drags  it just goes at the right pace  and has some genuinely funny sections in it . a generator of some really good catchphrases   br    br   it  s a hidden diamond .  

=======================================================================================================

629 ===> i rented this dvd for two reasons . a cast of great actors  and the director  even though robert altman can be hit or miss . in this case  it was a big miss . altman  s attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester . after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like  dead again   i didn  t think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey  and i hope it didn  t ruin his reputation . robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one  time oscar winners . on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating  money films such as this one . duvall was once a great actor in excellent films  even though his best performance was not  tender mercies   but  the great santini  . this movie was truly a big waste of time . i give it a  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

630 ===> i found  still crazy  to be marvelously entertaining  and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late    s  early    s rock . my   year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd  don  t worry  it  s only been three times  and she loves it too .  br    br   it is a truly loving  poignant and hilarious nod to the era  and every actor hits his  her notes with perfection . it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in  love actually  brought him more attention . bruce robinson was incredible as brian  bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug  damaged rocker stereotype . it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer .  br    br   i live in sherman oaks  california  and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall  he lived here at the time  and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time . he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time . we even talked of the idea of an american  oriented remake before wisely dismissing that . why mess with the original   br    br   my only problem with  still crazy  is that it wasn  t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience .  

=======================================================================================================

631 ===> this film is a very funny film . the violence is bad  the acting is . . . well dani  stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do . the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually  frustrated goth lads in . personally  i think this movie really does suck . the story and characters could be very good  if say the directing  the actors and other little nibby things were made better . but the film is just bad  the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it . this film is possibly the worst b  rate film ever . and  believe me that  s hard to achieve  especially when you  re competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for  serious  horror movies . i  m not a cof fan  and so i just see this as another rubbish movie . . . a really bad one . if dani made this as a comedy then  good going him . very well done . over than that though  i rate it low  for it  s crappiness . watch it when you  re in a happy  happy  joy  joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you  re high on multiple different types of drugs .  

=======================================================================================================

632 ===> this series could very well be the best britcom ever  and that is saying a great deal  considering the competitors  fawlty towers  good neighbours  to name just two  .  br    br   what made butterflies so superior  even to the best of the best  is that it did not just exemplify great  classic  classy and intelligent comedy  but it also expanded horizons  reflecting  flawlessly  gently  and at every detail  the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time .  br    br   i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it . the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself . this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones . and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time . then there were the decors  shop fronts  cars . these people  even the layabout sons  with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor  were sophisticated . they were examples of the  new europeans  that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade      s  .  br    br   of course  the premise was strange and fantastic . the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary  particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things  sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv  but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro  . and  if the premise was not surprising enough  the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme . a potential affair that was not really about sex  or even romance  butterflies dazzled many  but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief . . . at the time anyway .  br    br   butterflies turned out to be  in so many ways  prophetic . it documented  ahead of its time  post  modern ennui  all  pervasive lifestyle  the notion of emotional infidelity  and generational disconnect and male discontent  portrayed perfectly by the strained father  son relationships  . it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way  and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place  and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come .  

=======================================================================================================

633 ===> this sure is one comedy i  m not likely to forget for a while .  br    br   wouldn  t normally bother to comment on this movie it  s so minor that no one would watch it anyway  but as it happens  it  s kind of popular in p  p sharing networks such as kazaa  and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is .  br    br   so what is it then  well  of course it  s not really a comedy instead  it  s intended as a horror flick    intended  very much being the key word here . the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess  the special effects are only special in that they  re especially pathetic  and as for the acting  well  let  s just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school  my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent .  br    br   of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one  s expectations  certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned . also  even though i  m a big fan of the horror genre  i  m aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting .  br    br   but still .  br    br   b  movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding  such as humour . the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances . if you can find the humour in that   and i could for the first   minutes or so  gradually dozing off after that   then that  s going to be the only thing the movie has to offer . oh  that and two or three pairs of breasts .  br    br   woohoo  how exciting .  br    br   as for the story  it  s not even that it doesn  t try to convey anything the victims either use drugs and  or are involved in serious crime . the lesson watch out  naughty boys and girls  because one day you  ll be made to pay for what you  ve done .  br    br   i rest my case .  br    br   so  all in all  a little bit of sex  a fair amount of drugs  but absolutely zero rock  n roll .  br    br   i rate this one  out of    but would go to  if i could . or perhaps i wouldn  t it deserves a  for spelling the actors  names correctly in the titles . i mean  that  s something  innit   

=======================================================================================================

634 ===> johny to makes here one of his best style exercises  making a strong film with a good yakuza  s story . the election of the new yakuza  s boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization .  br    br   in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context  making a very strong gangs film . i specially love the way he tells the history  moving around all the roles inside the yakuza  s family  and making that we see the violence  like the only way they have to solve their problems . . .  br    br   talking about  the technical aspects  the film is a good example of paused  rythmic and planified way of shooting a film . one of the hong kong films of the year . is like infernal affairs  but without the easy action  violence scenes  and the confused storyline . strongly recommended to all asian films lovers .  br    br    sorry for my english  better do in spanish lol   

=======================================================================================================

635 ===> i didn  t know if i would laugh or cry seeing this . only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this . this is supposed to be a horror movie but there  s only filth in this . the most cool scene is the car accident  with real special effects from the best of hollywood . avoid this movie at all costs . see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

636 ===> this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy  s law being applied to home ownership and construction . if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional . since it was set in the  simpler  forties  we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era . grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas . their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment      .  

=======================================================================================================

637 ===> this was a disappointing film for me . it came to me via a boxed set entitled   classic film noir   which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style  i insist that noir is a style  not a genre  . i do not think it is a noir film at all . there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from     to     as noir  and the label does not always fit . there is a persecuted male protagonist  ed cullen  lee j . cobb   and most of the film  s action takes place indoors . those are just about the only noir elements that i could see . there is no pervasive paranoia  or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed cullen . jane wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale . i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers . however  i would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it .  

=======================================================================================================

638 ===> election is a chinese mob movie  or triads in this case . every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader  and at first it seems a toss up between big d  tony leung ka fai  or as i know him   the other tony leung   and lok  simon yam  who was judge in full contact   . though once lok wins  big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader . unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters  this one is not an action movie . it has its bloody moments  when necessary  as in goodfellas  but it  s basically just a really effective drama . there are a lot of characters  which is really hard to keep track of  but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit . a     year  old baton  which is the symbol of power i mentioned before  changes hands several times before things settle down . and though it may appear that the film ends at the   or    minute mark  there are still a couple big surprises waiting . simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture .  br    br   election was quite the award winner at last year  s hong kong film awards  winning for best actor  tony leung   best picture  best director  johnny to  who did heroic trio     and best screenplay . it also had nominations for cinematography  editing  film score  which i loved   and three more acting performances  including yam  .

639 ===> lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie . i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  br    br   this movie really waste yours time and money . i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema  hall . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  br    br   role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie . i think sanjay  dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  br    br   character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one . this movie show u the result of over  confidence . . . . . . . . .  br    br   the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  br    br   a really very big disappointment  

=======================================================================================================

640 ===> this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety . those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides .  br    br   it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren  t familiar with hong kong films  then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one . i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story  wise but overall a good crime film . some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east .  br    br   people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior . it  s a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film .  

=======================================================================================================

641 ===> let  s see where to begin . . . bad acting i  m not sure if i  d even call it that  as it more along the lines of a no  effort script read . the actors didn  t even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless . sure there was a scene or two with nudity  but that couldn  t save this movie from it  s lifeless characters .  br    br   to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do . the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants .  br    br   budget  did this movie even have a budget  it seemed like they used less money than i  ve seen in a home  shot youtube video . bad lighting  props  poor sound post production . bad special effects  if you want to go so far as to call them that . story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so  but there was no life to this flick i don  t care who directed it .  br    br   i  ve seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom . don  t waste your time or you  ll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review . check the ratings  you  ll see the   s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed    s with hardly anything in between . wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time . what a suck  fest   

=======================================================================================================

642 ===> i always thought this would be a long and boring talking  heads flick full of static interior takes  dude  i was wrong .  election  is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller  drama  taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads  rituals . characters are constantly on the move  and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider  it  s still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters . furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light  shadow contrasts . although there  s hardly any action  the ending is still shocking in it  s ruthless depicting of brutality . cool movie that deserves more attention  and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit .  

=======================================================================================================

643 ===> a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it  but after ten minutes of james hetfield  s slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think  why am i watching this   that question will be coursing through your minds in     minutes after you hit play . i gave the tape back the same day  as you would suspect  not worth buying or watching   br    br   just my opinion   br    br    

=======================================================================================================

644 ===> personally  i find the movie to be quite a good watch . it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized .  br    br   not only that  it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don  t just go all out and wipe out triads .  br    br   overall  the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings  torture . nevertheless  the movie stays true to the real world  thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens .  br    br   i  d recommend this movie to any triad  mafia movie fan . another good watch would be dragon squad . that movie has more guns than this  as in this movie there  s more knives than guns  in fact i don  t remember seeing a single gun  .

645 ===> i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel . . . so invariably my expectations were crushed . but they were crushed more than should be expected . the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand  which perhaps ruined it for me .  br    br   in any event  for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves . the scene at bishop myriel  s was fine . in fact  other than the galleys  things survived up until the dismissal of fantine . because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman  she does not cut her hair  sell her teeth  or become a prostitute . the worst she does is run into the mayor  s office and spit on his face . bamatabois is entirely eliminated . because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about  tholomyes is fantine  s dead husband  rather than an irresponsible dandy . valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair  so they reunite happily  yet another change . then comes the convent  which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up . thankfully  it was saved . after this three minutes of accuracy  however  the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butchering .  br    br   as cosette and valjean are riding through the park  they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting . about prison reform . when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette  he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set .  we aren  t revolutionaries .  i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave . of course they are revolutionaries  they want to revolt against the pseudo  monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic  you dumb screenwriters  it  s a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in     .  br    br   at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine . except . . . not eponine . or at least not the eponine of the book . this eponine appears to be a well  to  do secretary girl working for the prison reformers  who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain  . not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not  period  low  cut  tight  fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms .  br    br   the prison reformers  lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen  decide that handing out pamphlets isn  t good enough anymore . so they  re going to build barricades . i don  t know about you  but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops . about three hundred people  it was not supposed to be so many  start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades  etc . eponine does die for marius  thankfully .  br    br   the rest of the movie is sort of accurate  except that javert  s suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation . the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river . this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown . he saved the man  s life earlier  why let him die now  then there  s the whole skipping of valjean  s confession to marius  his deterioration  and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his side .  br    br   overall  i can blame the script mostly for the problems . while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film  they were terribly misinterpreted  as was the entire barricade scene . the elimination of fantine  s suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her . that cosette knows valjean  s past from the start messes with the plot a good deal . i did not even see thenardier  and mme . thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time . the same with gavroche . i did like frederich march  s interpretation of valjean a lot  however  which was one of the redeeming features of the movie . on the other hand  charles laughton  for all his great acting in other movies  seems to have missed the mark with javert . the lip tremble  the unnecessary shouting  and his acting in general all just felt very wrong . he also  like many javerts i have seen  did not appear at all menacing  something required of the character .  br    br   again  this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book . i would not recommend it to book purists  though . i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before .  

=======================================================================================================

646 ===> this film really deserves more recognition than its getting . it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties  favours and allegiances within the crime world . the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you  re classic crime themes such as betrayal and power . this film is a movie goers film  it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end . it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting  martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china . it features an arrangement of great characters  actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film . all in all     great plot characters but there are characters that don  t stand out enough and the music didn  t really get me going and at times i felt it didn  t sync well with the action  there is action by the way  so it loses some points for that .  

=======================================================================================================

647 ===> i just finished a marathon of this series  and it became agonising to watch as it progressed . from the fictionalising of the historical elements  to o  herlihy  s awful accent in later episodes  the show just slumps the further it goes . if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww  fluff  then i could recommend season   but avoid anything after that  it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera  with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility .  br    br   the old bw film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it  and even that is not what one could hope for .  

=======================================================================================================

648 ===> i was really excited about seeing this film . i thought finally australia had made a good film . . but i was wrong .  br    br   this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever . i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie .  br    br   the acting was terrible  especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent   and the plot was also pretty bad .  br    br   when i first heard about this film coming out  i thought that the title was pathetic  because it sounds like the cheesy film  stab  in scream    but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie .  br    br   warning    major spoilers     br    br   probably the worst thing about the film was the ending . i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was . . but the killer wasn  t even human . . which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie .  br    br   don  t see this film . . you  ll probably be disappointed   

=======================================================================================================

649 ===> this movie is bad  it  s basically an overdone copy of michael jackson  s thriller video  only worse  the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint  freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling . i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie .  

=======================================================================================================

650 ===> i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it  which was sometime last year . anyway i got to see today  and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after   mins or so . i thought that the movie was pretty good . but the thing i didn  t like was how the killer was created  i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends final cut  i almost died it . mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved . cut is    times better than ulfinal cut . the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes . the killer kicks mo fing ass .  br    br   i give cut a  out of    

=======================================================================================================

651 ===> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . while featuring good actors the movie doesn  t live up to the expectations . the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music  which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known  good actors  loud and dramatic music . it doesn  t change the fact  that this is a very boring movie to watch . earned itself a score of  .  

=======================================================================================================

652 ===>   cut  is a full  tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do . most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house  the woods  the anonymous indestructible serial killer  buckets of gore  and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they  re having sex  that  s hardly a spoiler  .  br    br   the set  up is simplicity itself film  school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher  masterpiece   unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast . this also neatly  okay  messily  disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel . they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film  played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines . the rest of the cast fit their roles well  especially the lovely jessica napier  who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her .  br    br   there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments  and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace . it also has an appropriate low budget look  including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate . good soundtrack  too . if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send  up of or a homage to the slasher genre . probably a bit of both .  

=======================================================================================================

653 ===> this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen . from the very first scene  i knew it would be a smash crash . it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission . as it turns out  the people in it were possessed by some random zombies . well  some years later  some college kids are pulling some pledge prank . horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock . things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non  chalonte manner  with pledge over reacting and over  doing the whole  eager to be popular role  what really took the cake with this one is the final battle . absolutely horrible special effects with the guns . for example  guns making a noise with no muzzle flash  and vice  versa . this is accompanied by stop  animation zombies  why they move in stop motion is a mystery   cheesy music  and about   guns that come out of nowhere .  br    br   overall  this movie is crap . just like so many others you can rent for   cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place .  

=======================================================================================================

654 ===> for a slasher flick  this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre . yes it is predictable  resident nut job goes on killing spree  people die  yada yada yada . however there are some good positives in this film . first off  i really liked the mask the nut job wore . it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique  although i haven  t watched every single slasher film ever made  also  the genesis of the bad due is something i haven  t seen before  and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept  as far as i know . i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr sicko  for most of the murders . the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre  but that  a small concern . the movie does not take itself seriously  which is something most slashers suffer from . oddly enough  while watching the movie  i was reminded of the early  friday the   th films  which did take themselves seriously . there are a few concerns about this movie . in several scenes  the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons . by this  i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot  and also the way he walked . of bigger concern  however is a scene very close to the end  where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance  actually a complete rip off  of another famous horror titan . and in the very last scenes  we have our scumbag  once again  looking exactly like the  st horror icon i mentioned . in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip  off from another icon in the slasher genre . these scenes were weak and unoriginal  obviously  . by the way  the movie is set in australia  so if you  re a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent  like me  you  ll be in heaven . if you not  than it just might grate on you . one other great thing about this moviebeautiful kylie minogoue  just don  t get too attached to her  there is one non aussie accent  courtesy of molly ringwald . overall  there are more reasons to watch than not . i enjoyed it and had some fun . so  i have to give  cut       which may seem too high to some people .  

=======================================================================================================

655 ===> when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby  the first thing they say is  what do you think of such  and  such movie   there are a couple of problems here . firstly  there is the probable chance that i  ve not seen it and thus  i ruin my reputation . secondly  i could trash the movie in question without realising that it  s actually their favourite . lastly  i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion . thus  i find myself sat before  the convent  which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here . more  s the pity because this frankly dreadful  horror  is about as scary as a box of kittens .  br    br   following well  worn clichs   the convent  focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned  laid and mildly spooked . but you  ll never guess what happens next  a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition . will any of them survive and more importantly  haven  t you got better things to worry about   br    br   the only thing that saves  the convent  from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolio  s bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger . it  s far too amusing to be properly frightening  the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason  the day  glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie  but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered . but even if they were trying  i still doubt that it would work  demonic nuns wearing the sort of make  up you  d see in the  buffy the vampire slayer  tv show aren  t really that scary . the scariest thing about this movie really is that over    of voters gave this a maximum score . i mean  i know it  s funny but i hardly split my sides . to be honest  i  ve had more fun in a dentist .  br    br    the convent  isn  t really a horror movie as such . it  s more of a comedy horror like  scary movie  or  shaun of the dead  but you  re laughing at it instead of with it . i honestly can  t recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then  i doubt very much they  d enjoy it . i don  t enjoy the  so bad that it  s good  genre  i personally feel that if the film  makers can  t be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldn  t bust a gut trying to watch it . yes  it  s a bad film and yes  they really should have gone home and done something more constructive . a rubik  s cube  for example . the dvd box has two price stickers  one for   .   and a reduced price of   . but it was sold for   and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy  cheap  awesomely bad flick . sorry if you do like it but  the convent  really is a pile of unholy crap .  

=======================================================================================================

656 ===> a horror movie is being shot and things aren  t going well . it  s about a masked killer . the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew . he goes crazy and kills two people . he  s killed himself and the film is never finished . twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it   but there  s a curse . people who try and finish it are killed themselves . the students ignore that . guess what happens next   br    br   the plot is old hat but this isn  t bad . . . for what it is  a low budget slasher film  . it  s well  made with a young and fairly talented young cast . no one is great but no one is terrible either . it also avoids the obligatory  and needless  female nude scenes . it moves quickly  the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn  t insult your intelligence . also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress .  br    br   no great shakes but not bad at all . i give it a  .  

=======================================================================================================

657 ===> this film is absolutely horrific . one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen . the story does nearly not exist  the characters are full of stereotypes and the special  fx only make you laugh . the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the rapper coolio as some kind of police officer .  br    br   if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didn  t quite get the point . if you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs . . . especially when the first special  fx appear on the screen .  br    br   but if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a must  see for you .  

=======================================================================================================

658 ===> cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams . it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations  both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget .  br    br   there are many great laughs  even if the story is somewhat thin  sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late     s hollywood comedy style . a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses  which must have sounded quite excessive to a     audience . as he makes his exit  he assures the client  grant  that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of     .   from the total . . . or at least    .   . . . but certainly    .   . hilarious   

=======================================================================================================

659 ===> i thought that this movie was pretty lame . if you  re looking for cheesey  you may like this . i  myself  don  t mind a fair amount of cheese  but this was ridiculous . the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak .  br    br   the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day  glo zombies  but even that isn  t reason enough to see this flick .  

=======================================================================================================

660 ===> what  s not to like about this movie  every year you know that you  re going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible . this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well . a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him . what is the good of having money like that if you can  t do fun things with it . it was a win  win situation . a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined . only if .  br    br   drew latham  ben affleck  was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands . it was a fun and funny movie .  

=======================================================================================================

661 ===> this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be . i dread to think what the blockbuster  approved edit must have looked like  because the director  s cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions . naturally  you don  t expect it to be  the godfather   but an acting class or two might have come in handy .  br    br   also  there were so many cute guys in this movie  but they were woefully under  exploited . i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy  but even i have a right to expect a little more . it wasn  t a total loss  though at least we got a peek a drew fuller  s  covered  junk and truly upsetting haircut . and there  s huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in  bring it on   and acting about as well  . there  s always a silver lining  kids . you just have to look really hard for it . and occasionally  you have to make use of your pause button .  

=======================================================================================================

662 ===> surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released . ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas . he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer . i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past  though i did like daredevil and paycheck  but here he is well cast in this role . i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who can  t stand affleck  s character at first . sure you can see where this movie is going but you don  t care . ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies .  

=======================================================================================================

663 ===> i know you  ve read that before  on countless other films no doubt if you  re reading the comments here  but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i  ve been able to track down . no doubt the really bad ones aren  t even available to buy or watch on tv  but even so i feel it  s fair to qualify that i  m not just some dumb renter who picked badly .  br    br   i  ve seen two thirds of the bottom    ranked films here on the imdb  and i  m ticking of the remaining ones with every chance . most of those stand head and shoulders above this . . . excersize in absolute monotony .  br    br   i like to rate truly bad films  as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are  by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through . if you can watch it by yourself  it isn  t that bad . if you can watch it with one single friend . . . it  s bad but could be a lot worse .  br    br   it took  of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy . and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films  spotting the boom mic for example   times in this one if i  m not mistaken  could take away the dry taste in my mouth . yes i  d watched it  but i  d also forced  of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end .  br    br   i hope and pray we saw the directors cut . . . to think that there could be a version with   more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me . so much of the film centers around this .  br    br   i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget  just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes . but it isn  t a good film . the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money  considering inflation  and was an utter gem . it  s not an excuse for how bad this baby is .  br    br   spoilers ahead . . .  br    br   it  s not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters . . . the pacing of the film . . . is insane . . . nothing . . . is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging . no matter what your alignment or sex . . . rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time .  br    br   the acting is cheese . . . but not overly amatuer . . . i  ve seen a lot worse in better films . . . but somehow it  s the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you  ll ever hear in a film  that really grates .  br    br   rent this if  like me  you have a fascination with the worst of the worst  and only if you  re going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it . this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair . it  s an endurance test you probably want to skip .  br    br   i  m sure there is worse . . . but i wouldn  t be surprised if it has decoteau  s name on it .  

=======================================================================================================

664 ===> this movie isn  t as bad as i heard . it was enjoyable  funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season . it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music . when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection . it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year . i heard that ben  s character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time . take it for what is it  a christmas comedy with a love twist . i enjoyed it . no  it isn  t titanic and it won  t make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two . so go laugh and have a good time   

=======================================================================================================

665 ===> cheap and mind  blisteringly dull story and acting . not a single good line  not even a line bad enough to be good  and no memorable delivery . even the blooper reel included with the dvd showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having . the esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic  and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable . the  homoerotic  overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying  and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers . i  m not gay enough to appreciate it  but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake .  

=======================================================================================================

666 ===> europa   or  as it is also known  zentropa   is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen . the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless . . . a true feast for the eyes . the picture was a contender for a      s golden palm in canners . the award went to barton fink  by coen brothers   a film stylistically very similar to zentropa . here  s an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself .  

=======================================================================================================

667 ===> you can  t hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days  and i had expected it to be campy anyway .  it  s not all that campy in reality . with the exception of kevin kalisher and huntley ritter  who don  t take themselves seriously  the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight riley smith is exceptionally bad .  the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to  which kind of shocked me i assumed the whole purpose with these ultra  low  budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story  but they use lots of words like  technological  and  physicality  in the script to get their point across .  although it  s possible that the story is important only to explain why there  s so few cast members .  nobody cares about this stupid storyline  and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft  core homoeroticisms  which aren  t all that edgy  . i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason . the film is grainy  with a tv  quality look and acting level . there are a few  sexy  scenes that are alright   the boys writhing in bed in their boxers  feeling themselves up or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them   and some of them are kinda funny . and i liked the digs at l . ron hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones  but it still isn  t any good .      

=======================================================================================================

668 ===> i was greatly moved when i watched the movie . how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing . so many people only care about what they want  and fuss about all the things they don  t have . and they are such small things  like chothes  money a new car . i  ve seen people in tears because of a blemish . this movie brings everything back to the basics . love  hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life . it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant . you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food  a roof over your head and your loved ones around you . you are truly blessed . and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning . and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith  strenght  and humor with me . thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above .  

=======================================================================================================

669 ===> rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements  facials and performances of  not humans  . this time he is the animal . marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day  nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked  so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man . but on his way to the crime scene  he crashes with his car and gets really damaged . he doesn  t remember what happens and at the next ordinary day  his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts . of course  we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings  are useless . she is played by collen haskell . there are no negative characters . the negative character  is destiny if i could use this metaphor . marvin should find out  how to become a normal human being again . by the way  his animal instincts  helps him in some situations . schneider  s performance is a so  so . the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies  called mindless fun as i have written above . so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in . he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie .  

=======================================================================================================

670 ===> in september        year  old jonny kennedy died . he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa  eb   which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch  leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer . in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death  and the result was a film  first broadcast in march  that was an uplifting  confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man . not shying away from the grim reality of eb  the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full . produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march     the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year . it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonny  s charity  debra . a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy .

671 ===> redundant  but again the case . if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics  in this case  schneider   then you should go . basic comedy . man  s life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him . unfortunately  he takes on each animal  s characteristics . former survivor colleen looks pretty good here  now that she doesn  t have open sores on her legs  and a little makeup on her face  d

672 ===> i couldn  t hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary . it was heart  breaking  disturbing  and inspiring all in one . i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives . or simply  something that will make you think . you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life . you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude . at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual . you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us . his life and struggles will make you cry  laugh  and find that life  s a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time .  

=======================================================================================================

673 ===> this is a very bad movie . i laughed once or twice  and the storyline sucks  there is maybe one funny joke  it is stupid and it is boring . through the whole short movie  i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end .  br    br   no one acts human  and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous . rob schneider acting like an animal isn  t something i would pay to see . it looked funny  but the bottom line don  t waste you  re precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie .  br    br   i was wondering when it was going to end  even though it is a short movie . in the beginning we thought it would get better but it gets worse . stupid  all the way to the end . i walked out of the theater  and i would remember that movie as extremely bad forever .  br    br   the writer and co  producer of this film is a simpsons tv writer  but this is nothing like the simpsons  this movie sucks      

=======================================================================================================

674 ===> a most recommendable masterpiece  not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos  not to mention the acting of giants  mastroianni and moreau  and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis . gregory karr  s performance may seem overshadowed by his  tough  partners  at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character  which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl  khrysikou  and the man  mastroianni   albeit hinted beforehand .  hence the spoiler .   br    br   get your expectations straight  it  s an  art movie  in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention . not for spending free time  but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert . due to the overall photographic style  large screen viewing is recommended .  br    br   dialogues are used sparingly . but the film includes  in addition to the standard greek and english speaking  fragments spoken in albanian  kurdish and turkish  which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages .  

=======================================================================================================

675 ===> i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly . it is not even funny . any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it . in the first half hour  rob schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk . all i could think was  he deserves it  for making such a bad movie  . don  t waste your time or money on this one .  

=======================================================================================================

676 ===> william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex  wife in  the ex  mrs . bradford   also starring jean arthur  eric blore  and james gleason . it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed . though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple  the actor made a couple of other  thin man  type movies  one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur  both to very good effect .  br    br   somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty  debonair professional and  the ex  mrs . bradford  is no exception . the ex  mrs . b has mr . b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she  s dragged him into . and this isn  t the first time she  s done that  it almost seems as though there was a  bradford  film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films  mr . b complains that his mystery  writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases . this time  a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line .  br    br   the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it  s beside the point . the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex  mrs . b . jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny . however  with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does  the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained . i suspect the writer had something else in mind  say  the wacky side of carole lombard . when arthur hears that the police have arrived  she says   ah  it  s probably about my alimony . i  ve been waiting for the police to take a hand in it   it  s more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement . it still works well  and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own .  br    br   definitely worth watching  as william powell and jean arthur always were .  

=======================================================================================================

677 ===> ain  t it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him  turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way  that formula never gets old  does it  it  s such a sure fire way to make a classic film  just look at major hits like liar liar and big  . . . this must have been rob schneider  s line of thinking when he made semi  successful deuce bigalow male gigolo and followed it with the animal . since i  ve already traced the plot through sarcasm  allow me to color it in more schneider plays a loser cop who  s suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery . . . by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts  causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times  run like a cheetah  etc . this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider  starring flicks  such as another lame same  plot follow  up the hot chick   but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead  colleen haskell from  survivor   and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald . my favorite scene . . . just does not exist . sorry  nothing memorably good except the production value . i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay  but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way   you can do it     there  s a word for that   milking .  actually  here  s another word   cheap .   

=======================================================================================================

678 ===> the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery  which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever . powell is probably the most suave detective of the    s  and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells . they are extremely fun to watch  so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold . eric blore also has some comic turns as powell  s butler .  br    br   powell  s contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio  but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script  so he eagerly accepted the assignment . they had worked together in two     paramount films  the canary murder case and the greene murder case  both in the philo vance series .  

=======================================================================================================

679 ===> i  m a fan of columbo  especially on a rainy saturday  and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit     but this episode was very lacking . the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance  even years before the modern detective shows of today . but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and  modern  electronics equipment and  of course  the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale . the high  tech home is a jetson  s or disney version of tomorrowland  and fun to think of writers inventing those  way  out gizmos  .  br    br   if its sunny outside  go play  as there are much better columbo episodes . still  we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast .  

=======================================================================================================

680 ===> five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas  but it features some of the best hand  to  hand fight sequences in hong kong film history . director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece . this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms . meng lo plays yet another bad ass . he would go on to be in super ninjas . kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled . any chop socky fan can apperciate this . but i still think it ain  t as good as super ninjas  also made by chang cheh  . but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best .  

=======================================================================================================

681 ===> dreary . schlocky . just plain dreadful and awful . let  s be honest  when you sit down to watch something called the double  d avenger you aren  t expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment . you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts . you don  t get really either of these in the video . the story  as it consistent with most of these types  is inane kitten natividad runs a local pub  finds out she has breast cancer  flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super  human abilities giver  returns and fights  dressed as the double  d avenger  a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition . as stories go  i have seen a lot worse  but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous . the action sequences lack zip  drive  motivation  and are tissue thin . the acting isn  t even properly campy and the dialog is the pits . nothing  and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy  handed boob references . all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it  but they all fall way short . kitten  haji  and raven de la croix are all quite older  still lovely in their own ways  yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be older  campy caricatures of their former selves . instead  they look so lame and desperate  more because of the vehicle they are  starring  in rather than their own abilities . there are some other lovely ladies  but you really do not see much of anything . pg    definitely could be an appropriate rating for this . the material  the actresses  and director are all tired  tiresome  and dated  and again  not funny  it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this  and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun . the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me . not that he was good at all mind you  but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was . the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr . sci  fi himself  forrest j . ackerman  play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie . other than that this is a complete bust  now how is that for another tired  dreadful  trite pun   

=======================================================================================================

682 ===> after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin  i bought it on dvd  hence the  spin  pun . . . i  m a dork  . the beginning was everything i hoped for  a perfect set  up  along with some quotes that i  ve heard on various wu  tang albums  to what should have been a good movie . but the plot i heard was so great  was so predictable . every time i saw a character  except for the lizard  i guessed which venom he was . plus  the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie . ok  so the plot wasn  t very good but at least there was some good kung  fu right  wrong . the fights were very short and few and far between . granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer . i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened . i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened . i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than  total minutes but it never happened . in short  not much happens . the fighting is all pretty routine . don  t be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot  it does not mean it  s a good one .  

=======================================================================================================

683 ===> worse than the rating it has been given . this is a typical scifi movie nowadays bad to awful acting  a script that is poorly written  and shoddy direction . from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end  this movie is terrible . in the beginning scenes this movie has moses  which was charlton heston in the demille film   pharoah  yul brynner  and nefretiri  anne baxtor  overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand . the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to  supposedly  be . the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance . the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert . i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality .  

=======================================================================================================

684 ===> i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid  and i thought it was so cool  now i am   years old  and my friend has it on dvd     br    br   we got a case of brew  and watched this classic  it lost none of it  s original kung fu coolness  if you are a fan of kung fu  karate movies  this is a must see . . . the dvd is available . i believe this movie is also called  pick your poison  .  br    br   watch it soon   

=======================================================================================================

685 ===> i  m at this very moment debating whether i should even finish watching this  poppycock  of a movie . they had a pretty interesting idea  with the buried movie set  and that was it . so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story . there is the buried set  some wolf headed monster running amok  an amulet  and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is . what i would have missed  had i had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase  some really bad c . g . i .  some incredibly stupid dialog  more bad c . g . i .  and the hero fighting paper cut outs . other than the original idea  this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities . my mistake for continuing to watch .  merk  

=======================================================================================================

686 ===> this is one of my favourite kung  fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late    s . the plot is interesting and twisty  the characters are cool each with their own style  toad  snake  lizard etc . the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh  venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung  fu styles on display from the various characters . i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang cheh  s films are the same  most of his films usually focus on the   tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts . this film is breath of fresh air in comparison .  

=======================================================================================================

687 ===> just saw this movie  and what a waste of time . the movie was predictable and slow . it  s basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball . rather than watching this movie  i should have had a root canal . the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship  funding . this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball  however because it  s rated pg  the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film . the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard . thurl bailey  s appearance in the film was completely unnecessary .  

=======================================================================================================

688 ===> by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over  as films were moving in a different direction  comedically and otherwise . with television looming on the horizon  hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time . where  one wonders  would movies have gone had television not come along  or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years  mr . blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed .  br    br   ad man jim blandings  along with his wife and two daughters  are living in a nice but way too cramped new york city apartment  as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs . so he buys some property in connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications . well  almost . had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind . then again he might not have . you decide . on this frail premise a wonderful film results  full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one  s own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one . nothing comes easy in this life  as mr . blandings learns but one needn  t be miserable just because things don  t always go one  s way . there is  after all  the long run . but  blandings asks himself every few minutes  how long is long   br    br   this movie is a delight . it is not  i suppose  a masterpiece in the capra  mccarey tradition  but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures  and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically . there is real warmth in the picture  and a good deal of  w . c .  fieldsian hard  edged reality obtruding periodically  but not so much as to leave a bad taste . the people in the film are all very smart and affluent  but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class .  br    br   lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr . and mrs . blandings to perfection while melvyn douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend  who often has to bring up unpleasant topics  such as how the real world works . there is  too  a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia  which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years  as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place . these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural connecticut . in a few short years things would change  as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear  destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns  which soon would be connected by highways  littered with bottles and cans  their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city .  

=======================================================================================================

689 ===> this movie is a total dog . i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn  t feel like i  d totally wasted my money   and my time . the writing in this film is absolutely terrible . it  s a shame it  s not up to the standards of other hale storm movies .  br    br   they should have saved the money on getting d  list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right . even gary coleman wasn  t properly utilized for his role .  br    br   this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was   including the subplots . after viewing this movie  i  m left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite  like humor  where it  s not so much the lines as the character and the delivery . unfortunately  this movie fails to deliver the lines  the characters  the delivery or the humor . i should have gone to the dentist instead   

=======================================================================================================

690 ===> of all the kung  fu films made through the    s and    s this is one that has developed a real cult following . with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story . an aging kung  fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh  sheng chiang  about five pupils he has trained in the past . all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently . their specialty in kung  fu is the name they have adopted like lizard  snake  centipede  toad and scorpion . the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil . an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target . tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are . tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung  pai wei  and along with tang sen kue  feng lu  who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map . a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is . a local policeman named ho yung sin  philip kwok  investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow  chien sun  . sin has a friend called li ho  meng lo  who is the toad and they do know of each others identity . the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed . when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue .  br    br   this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films . chang was not your run of the mill kung  fu director and his films always had a special quality to them . while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme . even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that . five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks . then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is . very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves . i wouldn  t exactly put it in the same league as  enter the dragon  because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking . this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn  t necessarily about fight scenes . its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved . that alone makes this different from all the other kung  fu films . very well made with a unique story .  

=======================================================================================================

691 ===> trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you  ve heard about semi  devout mormons  and you  ll see they  ve all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film . finally kurt hale  s fortunes have changed  thank goodness  and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters .  br    br   the cinematography was amateurish  i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes  . the plot was limp and very unfunny . you really didn  t understand why anyone did anything . it was like i had sand in my eyes  and a     pound lady was sitting on my face  it was that painful .  br    br   the only reason i didn  t give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won  t let me .  

=======================================================================================================

692 ===> well  i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie . despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy  and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason  i was not disappointed . the story was actually pretty interesting the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil  and who is using them for good . the catch being that during training  all of the clan were masked  and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names .  br    br   the fights are a joy to watch  as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style toad  my favorite   snake  scorpion  lizard  and centipede . the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place  and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action .  br    br   the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence . but stick with it  and you won  t be disappointed   

=======================================================================================================

693 ===> i wanted to like this film  i really did . it  s got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat . it tries too hard to be funny in some places  the daughters over zealous cooking attempts   over reaches in others  the scene where they clean up someone  s yard  so he agrees to join the team  and has some scenes that  while mildly interesting  are really just filler  all the work scene  s  . and i didn  t find the  villians  intimidating  or worth hating  so much as i found them to be childishly annoying .  br    br   i  ve met people like those in the film while playing church ball . and i will say the referee  s are spot on  still  in the end  i really didn  t care all that much about the characters  or their quest for church ball glory . maybe because they were all so one dimensional  which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall .  br    br   kurt hale  and halestorm entertainment  has made some good films  but this is not one of them .  

=======================================================================================================

694 ===> seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately . this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic . i happened to see the dubbed version but i  m on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue . still  the dubbing didn  t get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour  poison clan rocks the world      br    br   the story  telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue  suspense  and inter  personal relationships . you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the  venoms are revealed and an expert pace .  br    br   the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed . it  s like watching real animals fight each other  but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms . such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema .  br    br   the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film  s genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution . . . . of course  if you just want to see people pummel each other  along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture  be my guest   

=======================================================================================================

695 ===> this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen  some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor . this nail trap catches these bad guys . the rest of the movie degrades as you go . i can  t believe that this movie is not even in the bottom    movies of all time . i also can  t believe that there are sequels  the next crap movie that i want to watch is r . o . t . o . r . could r . o . t . o . r really be much worse than this   br    br    

=======================================================================================================

696 ===> this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever  and may be one of the best movies ever . . . it  s got a great plot that functions like a puzzle  with lots of intrigue and suspense . this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions  with people hiding their identities and their natures . the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters . they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality  s and desires .  br    br   the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting . it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy . there are  members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal . the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film . . . when this happens  the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel . these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely .  br    br   one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death . the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death . this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective . we actually care when people are killed in this film . this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed . some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching . when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain .  br    br   at the same time  this is also a fun movie . it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film . there is bad dubbing  the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat . some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic . . . all this just adds to the greatness of the film .  br    br   and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries . if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic . everything goes by so fast  because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre  that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is . the lighting and composition are spectacular at times . the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing . . . in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example  imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed . chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it  s confines . he doesn  t rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film  but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work . he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people .  br    br   this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level . it  s art  it  s trash  it  s emotionally moving  and it  s fun  it has a true sense of morality  but doesn  t allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action . i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not .  

=======================================================================================================

697 ===> wow what can i say . i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick  but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance . lorenzo lamas  pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control . it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse . crazed hillbilles yep  needless tit shot  with a real weird scar  yep  crappy soundtrack yep  i wish i could give the movie    stars but  is as low as it goes . seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real . . . . . . the worse thing there is  more snake eater movies  . . . . . . guess its in demand .  

=======================================================================================================

698 ===> i have to vote this   out of   in the rare chance that she happens to see this review  takes pity on me  whisks me to hollywood and involves me in her freaky  funny world . but in all seriousness  it was good . first episode is obviously finding it  s feet  but it  s got that silverman weirdness running all the way through it . it  s not a laugh out loud sort of comedy  but that  s good thing  too much has a laughter  track to it  and this wouldn  t be right with cues when to laugh  it  s to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all . i can easily see this as being the bizarro drew carey show with it  s weird characters and incredibly strong central character . well worth a watch  look forward to the following episodes . a very good chance from the usual comedy out there .  br    br   ps  sarah  call me . . . .

699 ===> now  i  ve seen a lot of bad movies . i like bad movies . especially bad action movies . i  ve seen  and enjoyed  all of jean  claude van damme  s movies  including the one where he  s his own clone  both of the ones where he plays twins  and all three where he  s a cyborg . i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians .  hey  if nothing else  he  s got a great ass and you almost always get to see it . with dvd  you can even pause and zoom in   that  s why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad  it makes plan  look like citizen kane .  br    br   everything about snake eater is bad . the plot is bad . the script is bad . the sets are bad . the fights are bad . the stunts are bad . the fx are bad . the acting is spectacularly  earth  time  bendingly bad  very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so  called actor in the cast  including lorenzo lamas  and that  s really saying something . and i  d be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed  to boot . especially lorenzo lamas .  br    br   it does manage to be unintentionally funny  so it  s not a total loss . however  i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very  very stoned . i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry .  br    br   it didn  t help much  but it was better than nothing . one point for ron palillo  s cameo as a gay arsonist .

700 ===> don  t listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago   the sarah silverman  is wonderfully bizarre  surreal  immature  ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line  up . if silverman tones down the juvenile  doody  jokes and emphasizes the darker  meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at  we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled  strangers with candy  . but just from watching the pilot  its just solid  not outstanding  offbeat dark comedy  musical but with huge potential .  br    br   silverman has created a hilarious child  woman of a character  a prettier  younger  jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional  non  stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television . early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i can  t wait to see how this show unfolds .  

=======================================================================================================

701 ===> first of all  i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes  cause of the bas screenplay  . i don  t think this movie has any purpose . it  s boring from the first minute to the last . i don  t understand why this movie scores so high . i gave it     but actually it  s not more wurth then     .  

=======================================================================================================

702 ===> first and foremost i would like to say that i  m a huge sarah silverman fan  and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me . everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form  maybe not directly funny  but the situation and the delivery are what counts .  br    br   if you liked jesus is magic then i don  t see how you wouldn  t like this . it has that same flow and that same rhythm . true it  s only for the true fans  but if you are you  ll be pleased .  br    br   again only for the true fans  there  s no way around that . if you  re not used to her style then you wouldn  t get why this is funny . however  it is  and i hope you think so too .  

=======================================================================================================

703 ===> hard to describe this one   if you were a fan of russ meyer films back in the day  you will surely be pleased to see that haji is still looking really hot  though forry ackerman has not fared so well  what is he doing still making these movies anyway  if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie   . it was a pretty fun premise   a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon   but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length  and the jokes were on a level with your average joe e . brown comedy  or  abbott and costello if that  s your thing    basically just bad puns . still  i found this movie fascinating to watch  and for more than  reasons . good job  but still a fundamentally flimsy production .  

=======================================================================================================

704 ===> big s isn  t playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like  say mencia or chapelle  though i like them both  . she states the obvious in subtle  near subliminal remarks . her show won  t change the world  nor is it meant to . but  along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewster  s ex  boyfriend jay johnston of  mr . show  fame  this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction  my side  s were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode . look  i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend  jimmy kimmel  she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run  with  it . the best kind of comedy around . spoofing anything and anyone  like  mary poppins  in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense . this one is highly recommended  but only for those who still have a funny bone  and didn  t lose it in their most recent lippo  suction treatment or boob job  .  

=======================================================================================================

705 ===> i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input . i know they  re going for realism  but to be frank i just don  t want realism . realism is boring . if i want to see daily life  i  ll uhm  live . tell me an interesting story and we  ll talk . i can deal with the low production values  hell i  m a sucker for low production values  but at least work in some good ideas . the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit  but obviously i  m supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic . hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out . i can only conclude this is not drama  not by a long shot . we get to see rosetta walking to someplace  rosetta working in a bakery  rosetta eating a waffle  rosetta carrying around bags of far  rosetta walking back home  rosetta walking someplace . . . it  s just not that entertaining . there isn  t really a deeper meaning either . i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it  s just plain realism  the most overrated quality in the business . i guess i  m supposed to love this  but come on  there  s nothing in there .  

=======================================================================================================

706 ===> sarah silverman is like a totally manic zooey deschanel and i think i  m in love already . yeah  if you loved jesus is magic  you  ll love this . if you didn  t  what the heck is wrong with you  kudos to the comedy channel for shoving this in my face . my life finally has meaning  and  your car smells like farts  is my kind of humor . i  m a happy guy . the first episode had me laughing hysterically and i  m hungrily looking forward to next week . this is like grease meets south park . completely outrageous . sarah silverman is someone i could watch reading the phone book . her delivery is precise and oh so funny . she never skips a beat . come to think of it  it  s not so much her choice of material . which is some really good stuff by the way  as it is the way she chooses to deliver it . thank you  sarah silverman  thank you  comedy channel   

=======================================================================================================

707 ===> this is the story of two guys who found a copy of  funky monkey .  finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local cineplex odeon . after seeing such classics as  every which way but loose  and  project x   these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome .  br    br   these guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie . there was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required . it was apparent that the monkey wasn  t trained in the school of shakespearean acting . perhaps replacing the monkey with ben affleck might have helped the guys thought .  br    br   maybe a strong sidekick would help like a jackie chan or heck maybe even hulk hogan . luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and jet li look  a  like matthew modine . while some might argue that matthew modine doesn  t come close to jet li  camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good . when it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can  t handle the movie  the movie leans on matthew modine to be the real star .  br    br   did i mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with modine and the monkey  is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie  even matthew modine should get jealous with this one  because using the pick  up line  i  m second fiddle to a monkey  doesn  t seem to work with the ladies .   br    br   shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from matthew modine telling them  seven days .   

=======================================================================================================

708 ===> this show probably won  t appeal to everyone . sarah does what she wants she doesn  t ask for permission and she doesn  t apologize . this is a sitcom with zombies  robot dinosaurs  flying cars  and a team of wallet  stealing male cheerleaders . the star of the show is not a hero  she is a spoiled  bigoted pervert . if you can  t appreciate the offbeat humor it offers  the show probably isn  t for you . everyone should at least give this show a chance . it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman  brian posehn  the comedians of comedy   jay johnston  mr . show   steve agee  bobcat goldthwait  s  stay   and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon  heat vision  jack  monster house  . it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community  channel    . com .  if you  re into this show  keep an eye out for  the department of acceptable media  on vh  this march  it  ll be drawing from the same talent pool .   br    br   watch sarah silverman  s show . this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment .  

=======================================================================================================

709 ===> having watched this after receiving the dvd for christmas      i came here to pan it   but after reading the other comments  i haven  t the heart . clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age . well  let me not be a complete grinch it might still work for some children   if they are not too media  saturated and have not become visually over  sophisticated  e . g . from watching all of lotr and harry potter . but if you are an adult  stay miles away you will not enjoy it .  br    br   the good bits barbara kellerman as the witch  especially in her early scenes with edmund  creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness .  at the stone table she goes a bit over the top .  michael aldridge in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s . perry as mr . tumnus also have the kind of polished  skillful acting we  d expect from the very best bbc dramas . and the aslan costume works very well  amazingly well considering . they got the eyes just right .  br    br   the bad bits almost everything else  but two areas in particular . one  the casting . england is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive british school kids . how could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs  they move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well . peter has no gravitas or charisma  and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings   edmund is just whiny and lucy . . . sophie wilcox as lucy is so dramatically  visibly  drastically wrong for this part that i can  t imagine how she got the job .  br    br   two  the animal costumes . again  it appears that they worked for some kids . if the kids are still at a level where big bird and elmo are exciting  believable characters  they might be entranced by this film . but to a viewer with the sophistication of  say  a    year  old who  s seen prisoner of azkaban  when mister beaver comes out from behind that tree  there will be hoots of cruel  derisive laughter . the costumes just do not work   i could not  and i think any adult or modern teen could not  suspend disbelief when looking at mister beaver . the drawn animation later  gryphons  etc .  works better  is easier to take .  br    br   so ten stars for the very young and tender of soul everyone else read  or re  read the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination .  

=======================================================================================================

710 ===> great acting  great movie . if you are thinking of building see this movie first . the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same . the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt .  

=======================================================================================================

711 ===> ouch  they don  t come much worse than this horrid adaptation of c . s . lewis  s beloved novel . while the adaptation is very true to the novel  the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play . i  ve read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the bbc has ever given at the time  but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the   that it looks like this was filmed for . the worst effect of all is mr . beaver . i know computer effects weren  t at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time  but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid . better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role  avoid this at all costs .  

=======================================================================================================

712 ===> it  s interesting how the train of research can flow . i started out looking at an article about cristo  s  the gates  in central park . the article stated that the maysles had been cristo  s filmographers for years . hmmm . . . then i got to looking at their body of work . i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming cristo and jean claude in their stages of creation . grey gardens sounded very interesting . video station  in boulder co  is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock . dvd and vhs . edith and edie are women living in the past  and oh what a glorious past it was . edith had been well off  born a bouvier  married well  had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties . her daughter edie had been a dbutante  a fashion model and had many beaus . she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate . she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind . worrying too much about things . it is only a shadow of the world they live in though  because jackie o . came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted . it is a   room mansion that is worn down and worn out . but  in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls . if you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess . the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative . the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude  but she doesn  t in the movie . edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings  tea for two  . edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at   . it was a good movie  though not for everyone . when the cat is urinating behind edith  s portait she states   at least someone is doing what they want    

=======================================================================================================

713 ===> i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice entertainment . once i realized i would not be getting that  i watched it for a pretty well made movie  in terms of filming  and yeah . . that was it  . but aside from it having a good film quality  considering i had been watching grainy movies all day long  there was nothing good about that movie .  br    br   he killed   . why were tweedle dee and dum played by mudler and scully  serisouly  who can answer that for me  who can answer anything awful about this movie for me .  br    br   i agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff . that  s all it seemed to be .  br    br   poor mr . carroll . i  m so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales .  

=======================================================================================================

714 ===> little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for . even though their house was filthy  this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness . on the message board a poster wrote that  little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old .  this reminded me of when in the dramatized     version  big edie says to little edie   if you  re stuck  it  s only with yourself   these women had everything beauty  talent  intelligence  firm belief in their opinions and actions . perhaps if little edie wasn  t so hard on herself the first time things didn  t work out  losing her hair  her job  and the love of her life  she would have made it . this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead . the world will never know what have happened if she didn  t listen to her mom  s plea   come home  edie  let me take care of you    br    br   yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant  heartbreaking  and lovable  even in their extremely filthy home . these women were extraordinary  and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness . when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns  dwelling about what could have been  or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl  one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that  everything will be okay    br    br   great documentary    br    br        

=======================================================================================================

715 ===> a friend once told me that an art  house independent film ran in a cinema when  upon the closing of the film  audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats . of course  my imagination ran amok  trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work . well  now my imagination can be put to rest .  br    br   i am a lifelong andrei tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work . i have come across many people who thought tarkovsky  s films are slow  moving and inert . opinions being what they are  i found this not to be true of the late director  s wonderful works  which are wrought with meaning  beautiful compositions  and complex philosophical questions . upon hearing aleksandr sokurov called the heir to tarkovsky  i was excited to experience his films .  br    br   with the exception of the open air ride through the fields  stalker   this movie has no kinship to anything tarkovsky has done . it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning  even on a completely mindless level . it  s supposedly  gorgeously stark  cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft . there is a no balance  no proportion  and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow . the main character is so inept and indecisive  it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner .  br    br   i am also not adverse to non  plots or story lines that progress on multiple non  linear fashion . but there isn  t even a non  story here . one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost  as hair  pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a tarkosky time sculpture look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin short .  br    br   i won  t rule out that this may be one of sokurov  s stinkers  tarkovsky  s solaris   but to conclude that he is one of tarkovsky  s heir  based on this film  would be to call paris hilton the successor to aristotle . c  mon guys  don  t be afraid to say it . no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life . i don  t profess to fully understand russian culture and i probably don  t have russian values  but i immediately picked up on tarkovsky  s work as something magical  a treasure and a gift to viewers .  br    br   if it didn  t have sokurov  s name on it  and it aired on say  saturday night live  i  m pretty sure nobody would  read  all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick .  

=======================================================================================================

716 ===> grey gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn  t really look away . it was so strange  and funny and sad and sick and  . . really no words can describe . the move grey gardens is beyond bizarre . i found out about this film reading my uncle john  s great big bathroom reader  by the bathroom reader  s institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue . this movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed . one should watch it for their favorite edie outfits  which i am sure include curtains . when i get old i almost wish to be just like big edie  thumbing my nose at normalcy and society .  

=======================================================================================================

717 ===> perhaps i  m out of date or just don  t know what electra is like in current publications . . . but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan . she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved . just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way .  br    br   this movie was fairly weak on the dialog  the acting wasn  t particularly convincing  and the action was spotty . i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller  s book  electra assassin .  which is much darker than anything in this movie .  br    br   special effect where cool  action was interesting at times  but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical . tha hand was not menacing enough  and electra was not . . . . . bitchy enough . she  s the girl you love to hate . . . but in this story  i just didn  t care either way .  

=======================================================================================================

718 ===> fascinating yet unsettling look at edith bouvier beale  big edie  and her daughter  little edie  aunt and first cousin to the late jacquelyn kennedy onasis . they live in a rodent infested  rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city . it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric . little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually   . the content is pretty much made up of two things . the first are the conversations were little edie lambastes big edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer  actress  and dancer . these discussions usually become very rhetorical  nonsensical  and often times amusing . the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties . each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it  s only the other who sounds bad . in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling . very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it . the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus  coming each day to record  and chuckle  at whatever bizarre behavior may come about . ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by . their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in . despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever . for without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness . most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom . her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable .  

=======================================================================================================

719 ===> how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me . overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie . terrible script  with forced character quirks  the brown sauce  . romanticising all that is bad about dublin . the attitude of  ah  it  s a dump but sure isnt it great all the same  . plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences  the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase  . and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney  s character . a great actor forced to play this part that could  ve been written by a five year old . cringeworthy stuff . the best thing about this movie is farrell  and it  s a bad when you have to say that . well  at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent . international audiences be warned stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock . you  ll have a better time . intermission is a walk  outer  

=======================================================================================================

720 ===> excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies . they couldn  t live together  nor apart . babbling constantly  sometimes at the same time  they hashed and re  hashed the past going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda . i found myself laughing at times  but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were . see this one .  

=======================================================================================================

721 ===> i  m irish and i  ve been living in denmark for a while so i was looking forward to going home last week so i could see intermission . and i will go on record as saying  br    br   this film is awful .  br    br   it is not quite as bad a something like  the most fertile man in ireland  but it definitely does not stand up there with other irish films such as the commitments  i went down or michael collins .  br    br   some aspects of the film are actually quite funny  such as colm meaneys american  style garda . but the film itself is shot completely wrong . the bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom  in  zoom  out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama . but it isn  t . this is an irish lock  stock and two smoking barrels and it should be shot like this . it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next . the film just looks sloppy and thrown together .  br    br   the performances are okay  given the awful script . a friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed colin farrell around dublin for a week . he gives a decent display as a dublin dirtbag  but it no way compares to his performances in minority report  tigerland or phone booth . the best performance was from dierdre o  kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle  aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman . i think she should leave her god  awful stand  up and focus more on her acting .  br    br   all in all  its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best irish films ever .  br    br   i  m expecting a backlash from these comments because most people i have spoken to have said it was great . but before you reply  ask yourself would think so highly of this movie if it was set in england or america   

=======================================================================================================

722 ===> this is why i so love this website  i saw this film in the      s on british television . over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life . with barely a few key words to remember it by  i traced the film here  and much information  including the fact it  s about to become an off  broadway musical   br    br   interestingly  unlike the previous comment maker  i do not remember finding this film sad  or exploitative . on the contrary  the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength  honour and dignity . ironic you may think  considering the squalor of their lives . maybe it  s because i live in britain  where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money  where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit  deep and profound humour  whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect . in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a  cult  . over the years  as it faded in my mind  it shone the brightest  above all others as a one off brilliant  outstanding televisual experience . it was such a deeply private expose  it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical . but perhaps somewhere  the daughter will be amused by such an outcome . it is she who will have the last laugh maybe . .  they made a musical out of her before you jackie o    

=======================================================================================================

723 ===> i live in ottawa where this film was made and i really wish it hadn  t been . this is one god  awful flick . i really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is indie films blow . well  this film does nothing to shed this curse . the actor  writer  director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre  rather he re  hashes tired clichs from movies past . i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting  it  s way too overdone .  br    br   i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights . now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension  but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie . as well for a movie that dares to call itself horror  a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore  other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring .  br    br   the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development  the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back . not that this concept bugs me  but  i didn  t really find it believable that when the two main characters  both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other . this is done in such a short time span that it  s inconceivable  my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her .  br    br   the last point that i have is . . . . and i won  t hold this against kelly  but the movie is shot entirely on boring  emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film . although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat . my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel  which has been reported on his website  a sequel that was half written in one sitting .  br    br   lord help us all .

724 ===> this documentary follows the lives of big and little edie beale  a mother and daughter  who lived as recluses in their family mansion in east hampton  ny from the mid    s through the late   s . by the time the filmmakers find them  the mansion is falling apart  and the women  one   and the other    share a squalid room . the older edie beale is the aunt of jackie kennedy onassis and the younger is her first cousin . the women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition  but jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there .  br    br   at times this movie can seem exploitative  as neither woman seems in the best of mental health  but at other times  the movie is hard to look away from .  little  edie blames her mother for her current state  and her mother fires back that edie was never going to be the success she thought she was .  little  edie often seems trapped in the past  focused on choices she made decades ago  and loves showing off pictures from her youth  where she clearly was a beautiful debutante . her mother seems more resigned to her fate  to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions . there are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead  from the pictures that show a happy family  to the grand portrait of the older edie next to her bed . from what we see of the house  most of the rooms in it are empty  the walls are cracking and falling apart  and  little  edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on . and of course there are numerous cats running around .  br    br   at its heart  this documentary is incredibly sad . while neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life  the squalor they live in is utterly awful . it  s not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house  and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family .  br    br   however  as a documentary  the film is a wonder to behold  and is highly recommended .

725 ===> i realise that the us army was demoralised by      but this film was unbelievable . it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment battalion in a sven hassell novel . the writer must be a real army hater . the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell  and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well . these men were going overseas  the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from  and an investigation would have ensued . the scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one . farrell  the alleged barrack room lawyer  would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order  to torture pows in contravention to the geneva convention   actual assault on an enlisted man  sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer . intead he just walks away . after this  discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable . i don  t know how it ended  i went to bed .

726 ===> hey now  yours truly  theatrex  found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market  in almost new condition  and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a  cult hit  so of course it came home with me .  br    br   what a strange film . the aunt and cousin of former first lady jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis live in this decaying   room house out on long island  suffolk co .  and share the house with raccoons  cats  fleas  eyow   and who knows what else . suffolk co . was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right . anyway  this is one strange pair  big edie and little edie . . . edie  the daughter  always wears something over her head and dances  sings  and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense . big edie  the mother  age    apparently likes to run around naked  and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully    done to the point where we  re mercifully spared from that . these women talk and talk and talk  mostly about the past  and it doesn  t make a whole lot of sense  except to them . they live in absolute filth  cats doing their business wherever   look  that cat  s going to the bathroom behind my portrait     and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations . if i close my eyes and listen to big edie  s voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt  who was from that area of the country and had that lawn guyland accent . one scene has little edie putting on flea repellent  lovely  you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested . the box refers to these two women as  eccentric   and i  d have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for  wacked out of their gourds   but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them . this is equal parts creepy  sad  and disgusting  but i couldn  t stop watching once i started . this is not my  normal  type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating . it won  t be for everybody though  guaranteed .

727 ===> movie had some good acting and good moments  though obviously pretty low budget   but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed . the main point of conflict between the two leads doesn  t play out in a realistic manner at all . there are a few scenes where they disagree because of it  but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently  especially since the employment of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life  and adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money .  also  several times glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is  apologizing to adam for his past  while adam is shown to be upstanding and  traditional   which the film proclaims to be the  good  way in the end . i don  t like being preached to like that . i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing ltr  and he said that he presented this conflict between them because  if he was in glenn  s shoes  and he said he does in real life relate to glenn  s view  that he could never date someone with adam  s views . well  then  i think he should have done a much better job explaining how glenn could do it in the film . also  director said he directed this  his first movie  only after reading  directing for dummies .  directing was not that bad  but far from a top notch effort . i  ve seen worse  but i rarely leave films feeling this frustrated .

728 ===> one question that must be asked immediately is would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of jacqueline lee bouvier kennedy onassis   br    br   the answer is probably not .  br    br   but  thankfully  they are  or were  the cousin and aunt of jackie .  br    br   this documentary by the maysles brothers on the existence  one could hardly call it a life  of edith b . beale  jr .  and her daughter edith bouvier beale  edie   has the same appeal of a train wreck   you don  t want to look but you have to .  br    br   big edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east hampton  new york  that is slowly decaying around them . the once beautiful gardens are now a jungle .  br    br   magnificent oil painting lean against the wall  with cat feces on the floor behind them  and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines .  br    br   living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others .  br    br   clothing is seems to be optional . edie  s favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head .  br    br   as edith says  edie is still beautiful at   .  and indeed she is . there are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there .  br    br   there is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension .  br    br   their eating habits are  to be polite  strange . ice cream spread on crackers . a dinner party for edith  s birthday of wonder bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils .  br    br   time is irrelevant in their world as edie says  i don  t have any clocks .   br    br   their relationships with men are oh  so  strange .  br    br   edie feels like edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness . she says  if you can  t get a man to propose to you  you might as well be dead .  to which edith replies  i  ll take a dog any day .   br    br   it is obvious that edith doesn  t see her role in edie  s lack of male companionship . early in the film she states  france fell but edie didn  t .  br    br   sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said . both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other .  br    br   there is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with wonder bread and cat food . the cats  and there are many of them  are everywhere .  br    br   at one point edie declares  the hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility .  but they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves .  br    br   this is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort .

729 ===> i don  t know what margaret atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book . i  ve always been a big fan of the robber bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works . i am aware that the translation of book to movie isn  t perfect but this movie was the worst ever . the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it . i feel like i lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie . this really should have been a mini  series to tell the story the way it was written .  br    br   the actors for roz  tony  charis and zenia were well  chosen even though i was skeptical at first about mary  louise parker . i only wish they  d had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all .

730 ===> trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn  t yet seen . renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse . my son is so jaded with current  b  science fiction that he hasn  t bothered seeing this yet .  br    br   it must be noted i didn  t see anything about cypher when it was released in australia . it must have been very quiet or i just missed it .  br    br   well this was a really pleasant surprise  this is also no b movie . it  s not a  blockbuster  of the epic variety and doesn  t try to be  more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it  s plot to be fully savoured .  br    br   the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used  my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view  but they get it right at it  s  nd appearance   that aside everything else is top notch . in any case the affects are secondary .  br    br   i won  t give anything away about the plot . the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct  though with very different content  .  br    br   just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke . the actor was born in cambridge england  and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect  it  s a tad off key . see the final twist of the plot and you  ll see why that is such a brilliant choice  and lucy liu is also just right with her  will she kiss me  will she shoot me  edge .  br    br   i rarely watch movies several times within days  this is one of them .  

=======================================================================================================

731 ===> if i had never read the book  i would have said it was a good movie . but i did read the book . who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline . there is so many changes  that it wasn  t really worthy of the title . character changes  plot changes  time line changes . . .  br    br   first off who was henry and the investigator  they weren  t in the story . henry had mitch  s persona somewhat  but mitch wasn  t a cop . no you made it so roz  helped  sink  his body and used that as zenia  s blackmail against roz . the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him . her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother . her son wasn  t even really mentioned in the story . neither i don  t believe was his lover  roz  s secretary .  br    br   tony and west were not together in the beginning . he was actually with zenia first while in college . the black painted apartment was their idea  tony just went to visit . this is where zenia and tony meet  become fast friends . tony hides her love for west . then zenia left west  with cash from tony  then west and tony get together . eventually marry  at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time . only to be heart broken again . then go back to tony . zenia  s blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia . now being a professor at college she didn  t want to let it get out . i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully .  br    br   charis character was a blond  not that it really matters . zenia didn  t trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive . no she was there when charis had a lover named billy . augusta  s father  he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war . eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal . zenia and billy have an affair right under charis  s nose while taking care of them both . then zenia turns in billy to the government  and leaves on the ferry with him . not with augusta  charis was pregnant with her tho . charis also had a split personality  karen was her real name .  br    br   zenia did not die from being cut up into piece  s . . . . she fell or was possibly pushed  we never really knew  off the balcony and landed in a fountain . she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she od  d . she was also really dieing of cancer this time around .  br    br   it didn  t show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader . the book was striped down to its bare bones . then re made in someone else  s vision . why couldn  t you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie . it was different enough  and i  m sure could have been made more so .

732 ===> modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake   the money pit .  older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia cary grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas were all  superstars  in an easier  less complicated era . or was it  time  of course  has a way of modifying perspectives  and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary  there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older  seemingly less provocative films . in  mr . blandings builds his dream house   there may  therefore  be more than what audiences were looking for in     . there is political commentary  however subtle . finding a house in the late   s was a truly exasperating experience  only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like . politics in the movie  the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school  which in real life would get teachers accused of communism  . in real life  too  myrna loy was a housing activist  a democrat  and a feminist . melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas  whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism  and which ruined her  . jason robards  sr .  has a small role in the film  but his political activism was no less noticeable . more importantly  his son  jason robards  jr .  would be for many years a very active liberal democrat . almost the odd fellow out was cary grant  whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping . but this was      communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner . it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films  and then not so subtly .

733 ===> i ended up watching this whole  very long  movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it . it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people  anthony quinn  lawrence olivier  john gielguld  vittorio de sica  etc .  would have willingly participated in this farce . but maybe in     people really were so naive  the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda . there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys  with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man  who  suddenly  after   years  sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag . the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences . we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine .  br    br   meanwhile  the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death . to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war  in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of china  .  br    br   our good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace . they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a   year old boy . you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in     thought the chinese looked like . comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay  which is quite logical after all  don  t capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists    and that the pope needs to sacrifice something  too  for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice .  br    br   so when the pope gets crowned in rome  he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church world  wide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ . and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust .  br    br   apart from this  there are also some minor sub  plots  which  alas  provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie . i  d give it three oscars for stupidity .  br    br   by the way  anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope . he is much more plausible as zorba the greek .

734 ===> damn  i  ve seen this movie for at least  times now and i still don  t get bored watching it .  br    br   the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind  blowing to me .  br    br   the cgis are quite bad imho  but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just . . . just a genius perfect combination for such a movie . the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable  the plot is so good .  br    br   however although  the movie had little flaws  like e . g . sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too  slow   but i don  t mean the scenic parts by that  i totally loved those .  br    br   also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story  like when he is in the underground bunker  like thing of digicorps  where all their data is saved  and has this conversation with the guy down there . . . but that may also just be me d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized  they should have made the getting  back  true  memory  part a bit longer and  louder  but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again . . .

735 ===> sure  we all like bad movies at one time or another  and we in fact enjoy them  this however  wasn  t even a guilty pleasure  it was just crap . some guy  vince offer  who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk  high   probably both   and thought it was a great idea to make a movie . he then proceeded to show his script to equally high  drunk individuals . overall  this movie was so bad  predictable  and unoriginal i couldn  t get through   minutes of it before i turned it off . it makes you got served look like citizen kane . bat man  wtf . . . some guy that walks around with a bat  real original . almost as good as calling him fat man  and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit .  

=======================================================================================================

736 ===> i  ve seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot . but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now  and i wan tell it  s one the best movies i  ve ever seen in my life               br    br   what you need to know is that you don  t have to miss any minute of this movie  if you don  t completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end .  br    br   the end is what makes this movie so good  you can  t expect it .  br    br   congratulations to the producer

737 ===> the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies i  ve ever seen . i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase  guaranteed to offend  written on it . . . meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh .  br    br   this movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits  bad characters  and worse jokes . . . from the pathetic bat  man sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit  they just aren  t funny . the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between  watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin  for example  but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince offer  s ineptness at comedy .  br    br   keep the underground comedy movie underground . . . bury it

738 ===> it  s actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond  as i  m sure he wouldn  t be able to keep up in the nowadays spying  business  where fast cars have been replaced with hi  tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment .  cypher  is a pretty inventive sci  fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright  claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible . you know the trend in these types of movies nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot  the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again . the events in  cypher  supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world  where the major companies don  t really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other  s thunder . company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity  only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor  the sunways corporation . sunways  on the other hand  constantly tries to unmask the digisoft  rats and recruit them again as double  spies . in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan a seemingly colorless thirty  something employee who  s been selected by sebastian rooks  the ber  spy  to diddle the secret policies of both companies . trust me  it  s actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali  the dude from  tube   carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters . the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem  seconds   starring rock hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style . even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that    s film  with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless . there  s also plenty of great action and suspense  most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing  techniques during boring conventions . the middle section of the film drags a little  mainly because you already realize that it  s all just building up towards multiple misleading plot  twists  and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not  so  distant future . jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side . regular director  s choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c . dunn .  cypher  is well made and adrenalin rushing sci  fi entertainment  highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time .

739 ===> imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one   minute movie . now  imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity . now imagine something   times worse .  br    br   got that   br    br   ok  now go see the underground comedy movie . that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever . ucm is the single worst movie i  ve ever seen . there were a few cheap laughs . . . very few . but it was lame . even if the intent of the movie was to be lame  it was too lame to be funny .  br    br   the only reason i  m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it . he wasted his money . vince offer hasn  t written or directed anything else and it  s not surprise why .  

=======================================================================================================

740 ===> this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art  not an entertainment business . lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post  war germany utterly captivating . you get absorbed into the dream and you  re let go only at the end credits . the plot necessarily comes second  but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised . just wonderful .  

=======================================================================================================

741 ===> this film had a lot of promise  and the plot was relatively interesting  however the actors  director and editors seriously let this film down .  br    br   i feel bad for the writers  it could have been good . the acting is wooden  very few of the characters are believable .  br    br   who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film . there are lots of quick  flashy  edits in almost every scene  which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying .  br    br   i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no  it left me feeling like i  d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money .  

=======================================================================================================

742 ===> canadian director vincenzo natali took the art  house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube  which is my personal favourite sf film of the   s . it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube  shot entirely on one set  and took this idea in fascinating directions .  br    br   i  ve been eagerly awaiting natali  s follow  up  and although its taken five years for him to mount another project  i  m delighted to say it was worth the wait . cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man  s place in the world  and how through a completely logical chain of events  finds himself in a situation beyond his control .  br    br   i don  t want to reveal too much about the plot  because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down . it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it  s head . cypher is such a film .  br    br   morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet  is hired by the company digicorp . they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars . to his bewilderment  they are unbelievably boring . covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese .  br    br   while morgan is waiting for one seminar  he runs into rita foster  an impeccably cast lucy liu   the definition of an ice maiden . she gives him the brush  off  but there is something to her he finds irresistible . that  s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in .  br    br   when rita turns up at another one of morgan  s seminars  she tells him his life is not what it appears . and i  m not saying anything more about the plot . to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us  as well as the tortuous path that  s so much fun to follow .  br    br   as with cube  natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people  taking them out of the familiar  and basically seeing what will happen when they  re thrust into the unknown . and cypher follows similar patterns . but it  s not a carbon copy of cube . it has it  s own inspiration .  br    br   cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories . one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge . when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle  it  s as much of a shock to us as it is to him .  br    br   one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is . where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns  cypher is also on a low budget  but natali economises it as much as he can  allowing him to broaden the horizon  and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity .  br    br   natali  s direction is exceptional  with a deft hand on the reins . there are some amazing camera angles from above  such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast  robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside . all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture  which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film  noir .  br    br   the acting is uniformly excellent throughout . jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity . his performance is excellent because it  s so modulated . he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes . from a clinical  spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity .  br    br   david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube . he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black . his scene is one of the best because it  s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia . he is a supposed expert in identifying double  agents  and it  s a fantastic piece of writing  brilliantly acted by hewlett . all he has to do is look at morgan  and we  re drawn into his complex mind game .  br    br   but it  s lucy liu who  s the scene stealer here . too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect . but in cypher  she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove . rita is an aloof  guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish . i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control  and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone .  br    br   things come to a very gratifying end  that doesn  t conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did . but morgan deserves his happy ending . after he  s been put through the ringer like this  i cheered for him in the final scene . it  s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy   minutes .  br    br   cypher succeeds on all counts . engaging  shocking  always entertaining  it  s everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn  t . and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix .  br    br   a fine follow  up from natali . and now i  m a committed fan of the man . superb stuff

743 ===> hawked as the most offensive movie ever  guaranteed to offend everyone  guess what  it worked  i  m offended that we shelled out money to rent this . two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true . curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us  it was by far the worst movie i  ve seen since hollow man . i generally avoid the crappy ones  but got sucked into this one . we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it  and his movie picking privileges have been revoked . there is nothing remotely funny about this movie . . . even the  adventures of dickman  scene was sophomoric at best . . color me ped . thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason . . . no . . it just sucked . never watch this  for any reason whatsoever . not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny . that  s saying alot . please for the love of all that is holy  if you cherish your sanity  never view this movie . it  s many things  stupid  pointless  and worthless to name a few . but the main thing it was aiming for offensively funny  it failed miserably . crash and burn . . . .

744 ===> in a near future  the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb morgan sullivan  jeremy northam  is hired by digicorp  a huge corporation  to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors  sunways . along his training  morgan is brainwashed  assumes a new identity of jack thursby and travels to boring lectures . in one of them  he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious rita foster  lucy liu   who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be . morgan acknowledges a new reality  where he does not know who can be trusted .  br    br   the unknown  cypher  was a great surprise for me . this movie has not been released in brazil  but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex  with many plot points  and with great screenplay  direction and performances . in the very last twist  i recalled arnold schwarzenegger  s  total recall  . this movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once  and i really did not like the last scene  when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea . in only know the director vicenzo natali from the fantastic  cube   and this second work i see is also stunning . my vote is eight .  br    br   title  brazil   not available  

=======================================================================================================

745 ===> this movie shows a row of sketches  which partly pass over into one another . i realized the passing over late in the movie  at first it only irritated me .  br    br   many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact  using absurdity and obscenity . the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails .  br    br   my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie  my god  it hurts in my head every time i call it  movie    a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great . but it failed . at least the director made something out of nothing . but it isn  t something good .  br    br   many movies didn  t turn out as funny as they were planned  but this one tops them all . it  s the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making . no . to correct myself  it  s even worse than that . a movie with gags so bad  that they aren  t funny at all . it  s not even fun to watch the lead  actor  writer and director  all three the same guy by the way  perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies . the movie is too bad for that .  

=======================================================================================================

746 ===> jeremy northam  s characterization of the stuttering  mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu  s presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch . his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit  done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face  neck and lips . no matter the brainwashing  love has a way of persevering . love also cannot be  brainwashed in  with either of his two fake wives . in gradual stages  he begins to dispense with his glasses  to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses . the music is fantastic  hypnotic  sexy and appropriately driving at times . the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi  film noir  in the tradition of many classic thrillers . i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu  s portrayal  whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states  the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith  some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part . she is just no match for northam  s talents  but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author .

747 ===> i bought this at tower records after seeing the info  mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central . i was actually really looking forward to watching this . my god where did i go wrong  now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies  hell i own over      dvd  s  with that said  the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen . i tried to give it a chance  but not only was it not funny . it had no point  did not offend what  so  ever and was all around stupid . god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny  this is going right to the bottom of the bin . . .

748 ===>   having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city  jim blandings  cary grant  finds a property in the country for his wife and children . he  s hoping to find the simple life . but  building a house proves to be anything but simple . as the headaches and the bills start piling up  so do the laughs . will mr . blanding  s ever get his dream house   br    br    what makes this movie so special is the three main actors  grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas . any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own  so when you combine their talents  almost every scene is special . grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role . he is so good at playing the put upon husband . loy is a always a joy to watch . the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect . and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years . douglas also appeared in the old dark house  a particular favorite of mine .  br    br    the movie is definitely a product of its time . i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two  story  three bedroom  four bathroom house on        income a year . throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live  in maid and it becomes almost fanciful .  br    br    however  for anyone who has bought or built a house  many of the situations and predicaments the blanding  s find themselves in are easily relatable to today . and that  s where the comedy comes in . how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected   the biggest complaint i have about mr . blandings is the whole  wife in love with best friend  subplot . it  s really not necessary to the plot and feels out  of  place and very uncomfortable as presented .  

=======================================================================================================

749 ===> this movie doesn  t even deserve a one . this was an utter waste of time . it was a waste of film and money . it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting . my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone . there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language . but not only that  there is no plot line  the actors are terrible  the accents are horrible  the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie   br    br   the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt  who got only a fifteen second part  by the way  . i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times  adding only a new sentence .  br    br   a film similar to this is eraser head  possibly the most disturbing movie in existence . there is no plot line  and is not funny . although it isn  t trying to be funny . do not watch either movie .  

=======================================================================================================

750 ===> i wasn  t sure at first if i was watching a documentary  propaganda film or dramatic presentation . i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three .  br    br   admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable . but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on . we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment .  br    br   where this movie came together for me was closer to the end . the scenes had a realism  at least as i perceived it  that i haven  t encountered often before . you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants . this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarce .  br    br   the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in     as the war waged with japan . also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years .  

=======================================================================================================

751 ===> i  m into bad movies but this has nothing going for it . despite what the morons above have said  it is not funny . i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director  writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again  to love movies and comedy is to despise this film . i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was . if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here . zero  if you need to compare underground movies  see  kentucky fried movie  or early john waters . the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire . the rule for comedy is this . . . if it  s funny you can say or do anything but if it  s not funny you are not satirical  you are not edgy  you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny . zero   

=======================================================================================================

752 ===> this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle . stallone is gabe walker . cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists . renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie . stallone needed this role to get back on track . snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow  ice  cold and bad weather than finnish man . action is good  music in the film is spectacular . the bad guy is john litghow  other stars micheal rooker  the portrait of serialkiller   janine turner  strong medicine  . the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie . overall good movie     br    br   remember extreme lit special collectors edition  with good extras . comig soon in finland straight to video .

753 ===> imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one   minute movie . now  imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity . now imagine something   times worse .  br    br   got that   br    br   ok  now go see the underground comedy movie . that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever . ucm is the single worst movie i  ve ever seen . there were a few cheap laughs . . . very few . but it was lame . even if the intent of the movie was to be lame  it was too lame to be funny .  br    br   the only reason i  m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it . he wasted his money . vince offer hasn  t written or directed anything else and it  s no surprise why .  

=======================================================================================================

754 ===> this movie is really nerve racking cliffhangin movie  stallone was good as always  michael rooker put on a surprising performance and john lithgow play a excellent villain  the music is fantastic especially the theme  the movie is action packed and never dull  if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger  you won  t be disappointed   

=======================================================================================================

755 ===> fred olen ray is a lousy director  even as far as b movie directors go  but  haunting fear  is probably one of his better films . yes  it does butcher the great poe story  premature burial  and yes  it is badly paced and uneven throughout  but it is also pretty entertaining . scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty  fragile housewife whose worthless husband  jay richardson  is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster  played by robert quarry  . delia sheppard  a veteran of many early   s soft  core movies  actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress . you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic  robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes . the ending didn  t make much sense

757 ===> hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward .  br    br   it is something like   minutes long but would be better in ten . there  s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops  and habits in a church tower like quasimodo  only he is much less sympathetic  .  br    br   there  s a strange love story involved which doesn  t have anything to do with anything . she happens to look like his mother  yes so what  we know he misses his mother  that  s what the first ten minutes were about . they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o . k . short film . now it  s a portrait of a character who doesn  t change . he is a guy that stuff happens to . the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job .  br    br   there  s this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character . he paints his face  dresses in women  s clothing and wears a dead badger on his head . a badger  you  ve got to see the ending  he returns to his home with the badger on his head  and it is shot like a tacky horror film  to kill his dad  s new wife  which he had sex with in the beginning  . and somehow they thought this wouldn  t be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background . i  ve got to admit though  i  m kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose . it feels like this mackenzie director  guy  whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school . you are so smart  thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories  you really dug  what a wallraff  okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book  but anyway . .  br    br   photowise it is boring . a lot of talking heads . plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene  you know cold and warm etc . . why  maybe  hallam foe  is both a feature and a test film for color blind people . or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn  t be enough to tell us that he feels lonely  so they increased blue so that we really get it .  br    br   i  m not even gonna comment on the clich indie  oh  how  how  how  cute drawings they have made in the presentation . and all the  cute  sex stuff going on . this whole film is an independent clich . but i do recommend it . i laughed more than a few times . though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine .  

=======================================================================================================

758 ===> the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo . but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far  fetched notion .  br    br   the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill  suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws . the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before .  br    br   the biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation . the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end .  br    br   good movies are not made every year and people don  t get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then . apart from the filthy language  parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes  the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years .  

=======================================================================================================

759 ===> i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee . but then  in poland in      i watched it in a complete form . and so what  the plot is incredibly unwise   men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong  straight and fundamentally severe ladies . the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichs follow  sex  drive  constant masculine desire for sex  feminists who are shown like complete idiots  you may agree with them or not  but idiots certainly they are not   and so on . the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad  he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like  i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven  t done anything to her   . this was intended to be a comedy  instead  it turned out to be a vapid farce  full of predictable jokes and below  the  waist innuendos . do not waste your time on it  this is just bad .  

=======================================================================================================

760 ===> was this based on a comic  book  a video  game  a drawing by a  year  old   br    br   there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all not the characters  not the dialog  not the plot  not the action . nothing . we have high  tech international terrorists  criminals who bicker like pre  school kids  stallone  s man  of  steel  type resilience towards ice  cold weather  dialog so dumb that it  s sometimes almost hilarious  and so on . even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb   tango  tango   . a film that entertains through some suspense  good action  sequences  and a nice snowy mountainous setting . oh  yes and the unintentional humour .  br    br   the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go  lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a  swell  time . then comes a sweat  inducing failed  rescue part  which should make anyone with fear  of  heights problems want to pull their hair out . and then we have some more bad dialog  and after that some more great action . this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell .  br    br   stallone  s melodramatic exchange with turner  when they meet after a long time  is so soapy  so clichd  so fake  and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self  respecting viewer . soon after this display of awful dialog  writing  we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane . the entire action is one big absurdity  but it  s mindless fun at its best . although the rest of the action is exciting and fun  the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film . after the landing  our master  criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker . they send stallone to fetch the first case of money  but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it they take most of his clothes off  so he can freeze  and they won  t give him the equipment he needs  so he can fall off  . do these gangsters want their money fetched or not    very silly . apparently they don  t trust stallone  but surely they know that they can always black  mail him by using rooker as a hostage . nevertheless  our gangsters make stallone  s climb difficult  if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are  lest there be any doubts . and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are  they overact  brag  and snicker in a truly evil manner . everyone convinced  good . you  d better be . otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children  just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal  clear to everyone .  br    br   the old guy who flies the chopper . . . how the hell did he fall for the trap  firstly  he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals  and secondly  he must have heard stallone  s and rooker  s voices on the walkie  talkies . a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place  with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines .  get off my back   lithgow  i haven  t even started climbing on your back .  or  lithgow to stallone  we had a deal  but now we only have each other   and as for lithgow  s gang of murderers these guys never seem to want to kill immediately . they are very creative about it they philosophize  pretend that they are playing football with your body  and so on .  br    br   stallone co  wrote this thing . i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it . i  d hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i . q .  

=======================================================================================================

761 ===> proof why hollywood conventions are in place . stale dialogue  underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe . an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap  together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn  s bonnie and clyde       and george roy hill  s butch cassidy and the sundance kid        truly innovative filmmakers and films  but falling well below the bar . problems with storylines being self  explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections . the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically . unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor . stills  black  white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can  t transition well or to replace scenes that just didn  t work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid       .  br    br   overly dramatic pauses between sentences  random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn  t needed for storytelling plus over  the  top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late      s  i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post  production . the playing of music in most two shots and close  ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score . no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots  doors  footsteps and dialogue  a style used in the late    s through the mid     s by new directors  but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial  particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads . in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no  likeable  characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story . neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the  hero   a necessity for any story to work for me . we know from penn  s and hill  s movies who the  heroes  are . even though they are criminals  we like them and want to see them get away . i could care less who was on the screen in this film . i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non  historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger  s life from june     to july      his death  .  br    br   to be fair  there are some moments of good solid storytelling  which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits . john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn  t seem to try to  copy  other filmmakers . dillinger       isn  t a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial  big budget  debut  but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy .  br    br

762 ===> i  m far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi   which is an almost inexistent small role . and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad  even though i feared the worst .  br    br   when gabe  stallone  fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a     feet high mountain top  he can  t possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger . for almost a year he doesn  t set a food in the reserve  but than he returns . soon after he  s back  they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm . at least  that  s what the rangers believe . in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed . the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them . . .  br    br   this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever  but in its genre it  s an enjoyable one . i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers . i know him best from the tv  series   rd rock from the sun   but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well . overall the acting is ok  it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one  liners  but it also offered a very nice decor . this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment . i loved the snowy mountains and valleys  the mountain rivers and the forests . . . perhaps that  s why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action  adventure movie of this kind . i give it a  .     . if you don  t expect too much  this is an enjoyable movie .  

=======================================================================================================

763 ===> first off  i must admit that both films i  ve seen by this director i saw without titles and so may have missed the points . my czech isn  t bad but  having sat through two of his films  i wish i hadn  t even tried to learn . samotari is too cool . way too cool . it  s about ten different story lines that weave in and out together . that  s not so deeply unusual in a town the size of prague  tiny  really .  the main characters are between   and   . they  ve got jobs and only one studies . the best character is the young balkan girl . her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day . that  s about it . the only great character . everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own . how can i sympathise with such obvious incompetence  perhaps there are interesting bits with japanese tourists but do i need another stereotype in film  if you like alright music  see this film . if you want to laugh at others  stupidity  see this film . if you like irony and dry humor  see an original jarmusch not an imitation . and under no circumstances see ondricek  s film  septej  whisper .  that is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes .  

=======================================================================================================

764 ===> sly  s best out and out action film . it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters  solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured . stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes . this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the    s  a definite genre classic . as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories . plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form . action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film . the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner  michael rooker and john lithgow .

765 ===>   i love new york  is another entry by vh    mtv networks  showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill  obnoxious  woman . it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest  ebonics speaking  craziest contestant  and her mother  and give them a show on this network . many will argue   this is a show  . true  it  s not as bad as it  s previous show   flavor of love   but it  s just as bad .  br    br   it reminds me of a skit from the    s show  in living color  where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on  the love connection  dating show and he picked  robin givens  for a date . mike talked of how the date was okay  but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in . this show reminds me of that .  br    br   the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more   i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her  and her mother  to give you a name that is so ghetto  you  ll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv .  but these are professional reality actors  so why bother .  br    br   it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this . the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions    minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network   well  you can  t hate them for trying to make a buck .  maybe the wonder is  who would want to be with this woman past an hour  or wonder if she and her mother  s next show would be on the wwf  any way you slice it  it  s a train wreck you  ve seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil .  br    br   no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck  or any different from any of the others . appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an  end  to reality shows  this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end  immediately .

766 ===> eric valette is obviously a talented film  maker  and so are the two guys who wrote the script . therefore malfique is a great flick  made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination . well  i  m a bit exaggerating  but nevertheless i  m sincere . so  if you like dark  gory movies  go and see this one . it  s really worth it .

767 ===> this is the most saccharine romance i ever sat through . the perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief  housedress  and ostrich  trimmed high  heeled mules to watch in the afternoon  lying on the couch eating bonbons . in fact  bonbons play a prominent role in the movie .  br    br   the only reason i was able to watch to the end  is that i finally was able to gaze at keanu reeves  dreamy face in almost every scene . in most of his films  he moves too fast to get a good look . the only rapid action in this show is giancarlo giannini waving his hands with latin emotionality  more italian than mexican  really .  br    br   the dialog is as stiff as wood . unfortunately  no bodices are ripped  the hero is disgracefully perfect  mannered and mild . the aristocratic warm  blooded old  world family cliche is as old as the hills . what does it matter if they are irish or italian or mexican  this is a fairy story .  br    br   i knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie i hoped for . the glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in women  s day magazine . i didn  t see his name listed  but the art director surely was thomas kinkade  who paints the million dollar canvases of irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias . this film was literally seen through rose  colored glasses . if you like dreamy pink and blue sky  this film is for you   the bonbons looked really good  too

768 ===> now  i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft  and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school  maybe as a separate subject   but how did they think something that sounds like  ftagn yog sototh  could possibly lead to any good   br    br   the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may  if read right  get them out . as prisons go  the cell was totally unrealistic  so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things . it also moves rather slowly  which may bore people . but other than that  this is top notch horror feeling  mixing sartre  s  hell is other people  with a lovecraft  barker type of story  and doing rather successfully .  br    br   bottom line take the time to watch this . that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else . this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it . lessons to be learned yog is bad  almost as bad as french women .

769 ===> i always wrote this series off as being a complete stink  fest because jim belushi was involved in it  and heavily . but then one day a tragic happenstance occurred . after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow . now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote  or even to the tv to turn the channel . but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state   nuts to that   i said . so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me . what fate had in store was an episode of this show  an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad  general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with  and once again i was completely right  this show is a total crud  pie  belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn . the women are physically attractive but too stepford  is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer . there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell .  br    br   except . .  br    br   except for the wonderful comic sty lings of larry joe campbell  america  s greatest comic character actor . this guy plays belushi  s brother  in  law  andy  and he is gold . how good is he really  well  aside from being funny  his job is to make belushi look good . that  s like trying to make butt warts look good . but campbell pulls it off with style . someone should invent a nobel prize in comic buffoonery so he can win it every year . without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking courtney thorne  smith smacking belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage .  stars for larry joe campbell designated comedic bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he  s in

770 ===> this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film  the plot is somewhat lacking  but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference . this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please . as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining and with major stars like cary grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas . . . how could you go wrong   br    br   comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued  and is very difficult to imitate . a good example of this is seen in the     knockoff of this film the money pit  with tom hanks and shelley long . despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars  the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments . achieving true comedic dialog is an art .

771 ===> you need to watch this show once to have seen them all  the formula is exactly the same in each episode . jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife  at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her  she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully . in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i  ll take a stab at one now .  br    br   episode  valentines pay   br    br   jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared  he then explains to her he lost it at the casino . she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is . then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball  hence explaining the missing wages  . she realizes  her  mistake and the usual  oh jim  you  re so lovely  . . . the end  br    br   another very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant  when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk .  br    br   imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we  re so many now in terms of human beings with tvs  these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you  d get an audience .  br    br    two and a half men  on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious .

772 ===> in a penitentiary  four prisoners occupy a cell carrre  grald laroche   who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife the drag lassalle  philippe laudenbach  and his protge  the retarded pquerette  dimitri rataud   who ate his six months sister and the intellectual marcus  clovis cornillac   who killed his wife . one night  carrre finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell . they realize that the book was written by danvers  geoffrey carey  in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic . they decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison  when they find the truth about danvers  fate .  malfique  is an original  intriguing and claustrophobic french low  budget horror movie . the story is practically in the same location  does not have any clichs and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene . i am a great fan of french cinema  usually romances  dramas and police stories  but i noted that recently i have seen some good french horror movies  such as  un jeu d  enfants    belphegor  and  dead end  . my vote is seven .  br    br   title  brazil    sinais do mal    signs of the evil    

=======================================================================================================

773 ===> this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw  the beginning is somewhat good  but the end  i still don  t even get it  magical power     years later  goddess  dancing what the f is that about    the acting is somewhat not so bad . . but some place i could do better for sure   

=======================================================================================================

774 ===> french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene . malfique preceded the revival just slightly  but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made  malfique was obviously shot on a low budget  but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film  and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner . the plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic . the central character is a man named carrre  sent to prison for fraud . he is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane lassalle  body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy . after a short while in the cell together  they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal . after translating part of it  they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls .  br    br   black magic is a very interesting topic  and i  m actually quite surprised that there aren  t more films based on it as there  s so much scope for things to do with it . it  s fair to say that malfique makes the best of it  s assets as despite it  s restraints  the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout . director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic  and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell  it  s very easy to get behind them  it  s often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people  and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner  and this helps to ensure that malfique actually does manage to be quite frightening  the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done . anyone worried that the film won  t deliver by the end won  t be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying  overall  malfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade  highly recommended viewing   

=======================================================================================================

775 ===> this is probably one of the worst movies ever made . bad acting  bad special effects  bad plot  bad everything . in the last   minutes a cat suited  cyborg is introduced which muddles everything . malcom macdowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on hollywood blvd to pay the bill . i just don  t know how you can go from clockwork orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning . i could have done better special effects in my bathtub . there  s no continuity . the editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad . acting . do they have to smoke to be bad .  the gun either shoots blue flames or bullets  make up your mind . the bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing . whay is it called     seadly wake . it has nothing to do with the movie  

=======================================================================================================

776 ===> i didn  t feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless .  br    br   it is original  although reminded me a little of two other french films  vidocq and city of lost children  mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters .  br    br   set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off  this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster .  br    br   always interesting  with the perennial  black arts  well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable   br    br   scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing .  

=======================================================================================================

777 ===> if mr cranky had rated this  i  d be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here . but as he hasn  t  i  ll have to give it a go myself .  br    br   the only thing giving this movie a  instead of a  is that malcolm mcdowall  s acting is excellent . however not even he can save this film from disaster . the director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity  reminiscent of bad     s movies . even worse  both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was .  br    br   it  s not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the proxate corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container  slave ship to nigeria . this ship  s computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via usb   or something . the company should have been called the prostate corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name .  br    br   i honestly can  t find one scene that i could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie . i only watched it to the end as i had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me  malcolm mcdowall in particular . i won  t hold this against him as he  s a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie .  br    br   so  unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you  re male and you  re doctor isn  t doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you  re really community minded  buy a copy to support malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster .  

=======================================================================================================

778 ===> well  magic works in mysterious ways . this movie about  prisoners  trying to escape with the help of spells  written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense . even if it had something of a theater  play  almost everything happens in the cell  it never got boring and it was acted very well . in the tradition of  cube  you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal  you developed some sympathy with some of them  only to change your mind by the twists the story takes . some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air . altogether intense and entertaining and as i didn  t expect anything  a friend rented it   it was a positive surprise   

=======================================================================================================

779 ===> a terrible movie containing a bevy of d  list canadian actors who seem so self  conscious about the fact they are on  camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable .  br    br   this film is badly written  badly edited  and badly directed . it is disjointed  incomprehensible and bizarre  but not in a good way . mcdowell does a great job with what he is given  but is the only one in this film to do so  he really has a bad story and script to work with . it  s not even camp enough to be funny .  br    br   i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner  and even the sub  characters like eisen  with his nasal  whiny voice  confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africa .  br    br   didn  t the director see that the  creature  looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit  the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleske  s orange wisps of  magic      for lack of a better word   is obviously the result of bad actors  with no choreographer  overlaid with completely derivative special effects . was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film  not the good kind    br    br   learn from the mistakes of others . . . don  t even waste your time with this one  you  ll regret it like i did . i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid .  

=======================================================================================================

780 ===> i wasn  t born until  years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid    s and the rest is history . . . . . . i was hooked . the premise was pretty simple two hardened nemesis agents  richard barrett and craig stirling  william gaunt and stuart damon  are partnered up with an expert  if not young  doctor and biologist  sharron macready  to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china . whilst making their escape  their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio  thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come . . .  br    br   the series lasted for   hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived  one season run that has set it up for cult status .  br    br   monty berman  the producer  was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets  particularly in episodes such as  happening   a studio deputising for the australian outback  and the  snow  sets of  operation deep freeze  and  the beginning  but if you can get past this  and focus on the characters and the story lines  the show was really a lot of fun . it had a great mix of adventure  and plenty of deadpan humour  mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt  .  br    br   the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic  you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the     reunion documentary where the three reunite after over   years to reminisce about the show  and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig    . they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine . i have to say  i was always a richard barrett fan  i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge  he was certainly a man you didn  t cross  and those eyes . . . . . . . . the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv . i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since . however  craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too .  br    br   the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with  including donald sutherland  jeremy brett  peter wyngarde  burt kwouk  anton rodgers  kate o  mara  jenny linden  paul eddington and colin blakely .  br    br   notable episodes for me were   auto kill    the interrogation    the fanatics    the mission  and  the gilded cage  but i am sure every one has their personal favourites .  br    br   if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time  or to re watch it after many years  remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy  the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don  t think i will ever tire of it .  br    br   enjoy   

=======================================================================================================

781 ===> i find it heart  warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom  american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low  budget exploitation horror film like this . perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers  messiah of evil has potential  but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can  t muster the film  making prowess to pull it off .  br    br   the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back . it doesn  t take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity  and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of    s exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror .  br    br   the surreal non  sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the  blood moon   a scruffy and half  mad alcoholic  played by the great elisha cook jr . in perhaps the best scene of the movie  who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley  eaten by dogs  a little later  the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father  s paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded  murderous  squirrel  eating albino .  br    br   part of the movie  s charm is precisely this brand of bargain  basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way . whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator  with messiah of evil the boundaries between the  intentional   the  unintentional  and the  didn  t really expect it to come out this way but it  s good enough  wrap scene  blur hopelessly .  br    br   take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug  addled  feverish  stream  of  consciousness way  one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father  and the other narrated by her father  s voice as she reads his diary .  br    br   while we  re still talking about a  living dead  picture  messiah of evil is different and only loosely one  at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be . the origin of the living dead here is a    year old curse  bestowed upon the town by a mysterious  dark stranger  who came from the woods one day . in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass  consumption criticism in a flesh  eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years  you can hear the mst  k line already  man is dead  only his capitalist food tins remain   and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater .  br    br   i generally think that the surreal works in careful  well measured doses  how is the absurd to work if it  s not hidden within the perfectly normal  hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand . when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her  you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience  amused and satisfied with his own hijinks .  br    br   the general film  making level is also pretty low  after the half  way mark  the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either . add to that the choppy editing  average acting and hyuck  s general inability to capture true atmosphere  the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused  and i  d file messiah under  missed opportunity  but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate  even though it  s not particularly gory  trashy or sleazy .

782 ===> monty berman and dennis spooner followed up  the baron  with this  a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted  the six million dollar man  . it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster  and i enjoy watching it still . stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on  screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett  while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready . the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne . by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson  terry nation and brian clemens  while spooner  s own  the interrogation  compared favourably with  the prisoner  . i regret that there was never a second series the concept had so much life left in it . would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron  s affections  what if tremayne had learned of the champions  powers  did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw  we never found out  alas .

783 ===> what about dahmer  s childhood   the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body  what about  infinity land    the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another  suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger . what about the relationship between his parents  and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father  his feelings of neglect when his brother was born  what about his fascination with insects and animals  how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home  what about focusing more on his cannibalism  and what about his parent  s divorce  these are all things that should have been included in the film . instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down  snapshot  from a night or two in his life  and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks  to events that weren  t even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer .  br    br   why didn  t the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people  he could have made this point many times  particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them  which actually took place in a health club  not a night club  . instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind .  br    br   whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into   minutes  or however long   but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet   known as rodney in this film  . my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet  s character  to try and make us fear for or empathise with him  but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer  so why couldn  t he have spend those forty five minutes on something else  if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough  but it wasn  t . the scene in which he kills steven hicks  his first victim  is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing  and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life . unfortunately the film doesn  t explain that it was his first killing  or that he didn  t kill again for nine years . we assume  because his hair style is different  and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback  but to when  and why   br    br   what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career   one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations . .  br    br   some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal  but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth  it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed . why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued   br    br   finally  a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an   certificate  not a   . we needed to see his perversion in more depth  to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us . that doesn  t mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone  s head for instance  but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed  and what his modus operandi was when actually killing . anyone watching this film who doesn  t know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people . he actually killed seventeen men .  br    br   aside from the facts and lack of depth  the film isn  t all bad . there is some nice cinematography  and good performances from the two main characters . i  d like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge  more energy  and a better reason for making the film in the first place .

784 ===> the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly  s  i  ll take you there  is not overt  but clearly has ties to his work  shelly has acted in two of hartley  s films  . not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative  but the hyper  stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light . though this film is not ironic on the whole  thank god   the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss . with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies   i  ll see you there  is a great indie  film that doesn  t stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion .  br    br   the film begins with bill  s life falling to pieces . not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home  but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat . all washed up  bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy  played by the director adrienne shelly  brings him all kinds of surprises a self  help book and a  date  for her traumatized brother .  br    br   the unwilling bill tries to refuse  but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice . no doubt bernice  s initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to  rebound  with her . however  her pseudo  hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date . and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him  forcing herself upon him . to what end  we are not aware . . . except for maybe the fact that she is psycho .  and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy    br    br   aware that bill desperately wants to see rose  bernice offers her car  but on the condition that he take her somewhere first . on the way  she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun  a pinkerton detective  no less  . an imbroglio of angst  resentment  redemption  passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose . . . of course  with a few stops along the way .

785 ===> oh my . how can they make movies of such beauty  but that are so terribly bad . i mean  even uwe boll doesn  t make crap like this . there is not even a hint of a decent story  multi  layered characters  or attraction . it  s just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a  movie  . i suppose only children up to  years of age could enjoy it  given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent  that anyone older would be annoyed by it . but then again  it  s far too scary for anyone under  years of age  that there  s probably no one that should watch this movie at all .  br    br   take my advice and stay far  far away from this movie . your little daughter can make a better storyline  and though she probably isn  t able to draw pictures this pretty  her tales are much more worth listening to . and please  in the name of whoever you believe in  do not expose your children to this piece of  . i  ll give it  out of    and that  s exclusively for the graphics  because the story and character development are so awful they  d deserve a negative rating .  br    br   and if you decide to watch it anyways . . . remember that i warned you .

786 ===> i too have gone thru very painful personal loss  twice  and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well  life out of balance  nothing makes sense  well meaning relatives  etc . . .  br    br   it was nice to see ally again . she is one of my all time favorite movie actors .  br    br   i laughed and cried as the story unfolded . great story and cast . well done

787 ===> way to go ace  you just made a chilling  grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft  mellow  drama . obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds horror  or documentary right  this was neither . it wasn  t close to any detailed facts   in fact it barely had any substance at all  it wasn  t really morbid or scary or didn  t even try to be very disturbing .  as if you would  ve had to try    what the hell was this writer  director thinking   here  s one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot  poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent  s house . i think jacobson was actually trying to present  or invent   the soft side  of j . dahmer .

788 ===>   i  ll take you there  tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date . unlike most romantic comedies  this little indie is mostly tongue  in  cheek situational comedy featuring rogers and sheedy with little emphasis on romance . a sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving  stays fresh  and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers .  

=======================================================================================================

789 ===> this movie had so much potential . anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it  s ridiculous . too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer  s homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption . where was the character development  the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception . where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals  instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer  but fail to address the major point in dahmer  s development . also  the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details  how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this his cannibalism and his desire for flesh  etc . i could go on  but to sum up  too many lagging points in the film  focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore  the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is  dahmer .

790 ===> at the end of the movie i still don  t know whether i liked it or not . so was the case with most of the reviewers . but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a  for the amount of efforts put in .  br    br   long ago i read a quote there are  kind of writers   . those who think and write . and  . those write and make the readers think . while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience .  br    br   i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devils advocate and fight club . . . .  br    br   it is definitely a classic something which no one understands but appreciates . . . .  br    br   what i don  t understand why stathom  jake green  had a blackout  thats how it all began   all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one .  br    br   well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about i  ll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not then answer this first . . . . when you come across a puzzle labeled as  no one has ever solved  would you like to try   br    br   i would

791 ===> dahmer  a young confused man . dahmer  a confusing movie . granted  i had a few beers while watching the movie  but that doesn  t explain why i got so bored by this flick .  br    br   its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying  and there  s no real storyline with a beginning and an end  the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie . the inbetween stuff  which would be the movie  is just boring images and a waste of time .  br    br   we never see actual murders  everything is just a bunch of insinuations . sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer  s dreaming the entire thing  but you know he isn  t  since it  s  br    br   based on a true story and this actually happened  at least most of it . but what happened  it  s not easy to tell .  br    br   i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie . i  br    br   didn  t like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended .  br    br

792 ===> if you are a fan of altman  s large ensemble casts  as evidenced in major films like m . a . s . h .  nashville  gosford park  and lesser seen films like a wedding  then you will no doubt be entertained by health . centered around a health convention where two women are running for president  health contains many of altman  s latter   s regulars like paul dooley  who helped write the film   carol burnett  and henry gibson  while also including top star altman newcomers like lauren bacall  james garner  and glenda jackson . like a lot of altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film  but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like nashville or a wedding  rather it has a more centered feel  perhaps like m . a . s . h . or gosford park . the whole thing is an obvious satire on the health movement  filled with over  top  outlandish  contradictive characters  with guest stars like dick cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing . underlining the whole election process is altman  s characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having . this would be one of altman  s last films like this for a while   

=======================================================================================================

793 ===> this was a truly bad film . the character  cole  played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped  the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil  it didn  t . after about   minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance  this would have added some sincerity .  br    br      badly acted    unsympathetic characters    razor thin plot line  br    br   yuck   br    br

794 ===> it  s all very simple . jake goes to prison  and spends five years with the con and the chess masters . they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure  and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks . they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom from his innermost fears  from what he believes to be himself . for that  they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear  all the pride  all the hope  to be reborn as true master of his will .  br    br   it  s a clever movie about the journey of illumination  about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves .       no doubt .

795 ===> this is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a canadian . we grow good wine . our writers and poets are among the world  s best . the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world . but we make bloody awful movies  this one isn  t especially bad . it  s especially typical and typically bad  shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction  high school level acting and  gee whiz . . . lets see what this button on the camera does    photography . if michael moriarity was so intent on doing a jack nicholson impersonation  couldn  t he at least have done a good jack nicholson impersonation  and if the movie was shot in vancouver  truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building  part of the  plot   why in god  s name do we let that endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as seattle    not only am i mad about this film  i  m embarassed and more than a little ashamed . the australians turn out some splendid stuff . we produce pretentious second rate piffle . gawd       

=======================================================================================================

796 ===> having read the reviews for this film  i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good . however  this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time . the majority of reviews that i had read  said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow . and whilst some parts do leave you confused  the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you  ve missed so much . it  s not like  lock  stock . . .  or  snatch   in the sense that it isn  t that funny  in fact  it  s pretty dark   and it is a lot more intelligent  in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints  and  in one of the best scenes of the film  jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself  . the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned  is that it is full of memorable characters  specifically statham  who gives a fantastic performance as the lead  and ray liotta  who spends most of the film in speedos  but gives a great performance none the less . if you  ve got time  and have time afterwards to think about the film  and even watch it again  you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film . i think it  s fantastic  and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game .  

=======================================================================================================

797 ===> skullduggery is a strange  strange film based on the novel  ye shall know them  by vercors . to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind  since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity  and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance . but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well  meaning tone  skullduggery simply isn  t a very good film . for me  the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can  t make its mind up how best to convey its message . the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci  fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics . the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great  too jarring  to overlook . they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you  re watching a muddled  disorganised movie .  br    br   an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple  burt reynolds  . one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame  susan clark  . after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape  like creatures . these primitive  long  lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man . there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the  missing link  in the evolution of apes into humans . or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual  or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics  the archaeologists call the tribe  the tropi  and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery . but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen  paul hubschmid  declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers . he questions whether the tropi are truly  human  and takes his argument to the courts  where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued .  br    br   this was a very early film in reynolds  career  and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he  s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously . not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role  asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick . his character and the film are not relevant to each other . clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist  and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox  alexander knox and wilfrid hyde  white . a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make  up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance . rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids  the stuck  on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical . and that  s just not the right idea . we  re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures  but that  s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing . skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant  philosophical and stimulating . the honourable intentions are there for all to see  but the end result doesn  t do them justice . a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless .  

=======================================================================================================

798 ===> i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away . it is a real masterpiece of art and i don  t understand why most of the people think it  s garbage . the main idea of the movie  take your ego away and then you will have true power  this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way .  the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look   do you remember this from the movie  because our true enemy is in us  it is our ego . . . that voice that always tells us that we are important  that gives us our pride  that tells us not to give  but only to take  that creates our aggression  that wants to be in control  that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts . gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance . a superb movie

799 ===> over several years of looking for half  decent films to rent for my kids  i  ve developed a sixth  sense for spotting the really cheesy  direct  to  video efforts that are really painful to sit through  for anyone over the age of eight  . i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me  what did she say that for   and  why did he do that   and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes . and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply  bringing realism  to a film  please run them through with a dull butter knife .  prehysteria   was head and shoulders above this . arrgh .  

=======================================================================================================

800 ===> first of all  when people hear  guy ritchie   they immediately think of snatch . yes  snatch was a good movie  but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch . they don  t expect him to explore new frontiers . this movie revolver is different than snatch it  s much darker and is very complex . the reason i gave a rating of   is because i  ve had to watch revolver  times to understand everything . so this movie toys with your head . it  s very cleverly written .  br    br   this movie is different than snatch . it was done wonderfully  the cinematography is beautiful  and you can recognize guy ritchie  s personal touch  style of directing  in it .  br    br   what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers .  

=======================================================================================================

801 ===> while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing  i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery . perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made  as it is now      an official five years ago   after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings  and science fiction feats like star wars  as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer  s the odyssey .  br    br   my beef  basically  is that i couldn  t relate   i am just about the same age of the children  a young adult   and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle  aged man if that is the character available . but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence . i didn  t find myself saying  ack  i would have done the same thing   . it did not open the doors to my imagination . even without comparing it to high  budget films or other tv movies  standing alone  certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking  seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish  teenager  bitter  after  divorce image changing into the we  re  a  big  happy  family  let  s  never  separate  again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run . even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes . there was the ever  present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious  accompanied by mr . perfect image of combining athletics  good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude  and lastly the smart  aleck little brother we find to be so common these days . while i know the personalities pushed the story along  i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable   and believable  as far as character    movie .  br    br   i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design   that made it worth finishing to the end for me . don  t get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself  and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many  but i think that with a little more depth to the script  and a little more  i cannot believe i am saying this  realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical .  

=======================================================================================================

802 ===> glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made .  br    br   the film makes you care about each member of this fox family  from the blind cub to the strongest  their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic . set against an inhospitable countryside  the audience  s hearts warm to the family members .  br    br   the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms .  br    br   man remains one of the biggest predators  but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living  not just surviving beyond human endeavours .  

=======================================================================================================

803 ===> a very ordinary made  for  tv product   tyson  attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect  fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing  and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting . a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans .  

=======================================================================================================

804 ===> i saw this movie when i was little  it was called  glacier fox  . i was totally traumatized by it  it follows a cute little fox family around . the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little foxes . i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in hysterics . i won  t tell you what happened  but let  s just say it doesn  t end well for all of the foxes . i was used to disney type nature films where the animals don  t really die . oh man . this movie made me cry for hours . it was a good movie . . . i think  i was really little and truth be told  all i remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die . rent it if you can  but don  t show your kids   

=======================================================================================================

805 ===> second  tier american leading man guy madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this spaghetti western  which  having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine  though featuring a nice enough score  . the plot offers some mild interest the title  incidentally  refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun  runners on a ranch  the property of the family of their pursuer  cavalry agent madison . the latter  s younger siblings are determined that the injured party  now in their charge  lead them to the gang boss responsible ultimately  the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise  and both  ironically  become involved with one of madison  s sisters  another is raped during the raid  . euro  cult starlet rosalba neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess  and madison  s ex  flame .  

=======================================================================================================

806 ===> this film made john glover a star . alan raimy is one of the most compelling character that i have ever seen on film . and i mean that sport .  

=======================================================================================================

807 ===> a dreary and pointless bit of fluff  bloody fluff  but fluff  . badly scripted  with inane and wooden dialogue . you do not care if the characters  indeed  even if the actors themselves  live or die . little grace or charm  little action  little point to the whole thing . perhaps some of the set and setting will interest   those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived . the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting  and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept .

808 ===> life  s going not to badly for harry mitchell  he  s an ex  air force major  plus nifty little pension i imagine   who  s raking in the cash for a patent he  s developed  fusing titanium and steel via explosive process  creating super metal fit for nasa   and his wife of twenty  odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick . he  s got a nice little pad in la . i like to see visions of the   s consumer dream  and you get a good slice here  what with the restored silver jag  a series  e  type roadster  for him  and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her  as well as i  m sure other trinkets and boys toys  . there  s always got to be more though hasn  t there  so harry let  s himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans  you  re only as old as the woman you  re feeling  . as in many films noir  one mistake  in an otherwise blotch  less life  leads to a downwards arc for harry .  br    br   three blackmailers leech onto him . these are where the value are for me  great character actors playing very believable roles . bobby shy  played by clarence williams iii  is a black ex  con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double  crossers . he  s reminiscent of pluto  the vicious black ex  con psychopath from carl franklin  s well  regarded neo  noir  one false move        . there  s a similar character motivation i believe . both men have had enough of the man  and well pretty much everyone  in extremis . robert trebor plays leo franks  a fat lily  livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at    for half an hour  and    for a whole hour  did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount   . he  s in over his head  and it  s great to watch trebor acting when leo starts to feel the heat  believable breakdown . john glover wins as alan raimy  who is the brains of the plot  an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui . he  s a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie  including what i believe is a pretty well  implied rape  pay attention to his rap sheet readout  it  s easily missed  and read between the lines for the motel scene with  slim   .  br    br   in common with one false move  though not exclusively  i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence .  br    br   so far so good but i think there  s a real problem with the film . harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his  tit in the wringer  . my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy scheider . roy scheider protagonists never lose  they  re self  sure and smooth  but not in an annoying way . i feel i  m being asked to believe that his character is in peril  the movie relies on this for dramatic tension however i didn  t believe it . for me it  s like being asked to believe that sandra bullock  s character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama  or stephen seagal  s character is going to get taken down by the baddies  did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value  . roy scheider doesn  t convince as an adulterer either  you don  t feel any annoyance with him at all  his character is teflon  coated .  br    br   it also felt like a movie that took some cuts . at    minutes it still feels underdeveloped harry  s wife  ann margaret  is pretty much a cardboard cutout  an extension of harry  her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention . the effect that the affair has on harry  s marriage isn  t properly communicated . this could be a frankenheimer problem  he  s not known for character development . i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the irs .  br    br   there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film  but i feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of harry could have been done better  no disrespect to the great roy scheider  . the film felt short  even with the long running time  and i think could have taken some more fleshing out .  br    br   but you really can  t forget the sleaze  like the deliciously pervy scene of harry taking photos of doreen in the nudie parlour .

809 ===> when i saw this movie i heard all the hype  and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent . i was wrong . i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community  if they are not african americans themselves  . i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won . sometimes this is true  not as much nowadays  because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture . the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was  is because people see a movie about the  semi  spoiler  hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece .  br    br   denzel washington is an outstanding actor  but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever . i was bored with him in the movie  and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good . the audience is supposed to leave believing this man  rubin carter  is a saint . people left the movies worshipping this man  this hero  and they went out and bought his book  making this hero of a man rich .  br    br   spoilers this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit . of course the crimes he did commit  stealing mostly  was only to survive  nothing more . people felt sorry for him  even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society . everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint  except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife  but why wouldn  t it  after all  it is his point of view . i do not like movies  especially hollywood interpretations  that are based on  true  stories because they usually distort the  true  parts into something else  something not so true . this was his point of view and a hollywood construction  yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably . well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions  and he was a very violent man . not only that  there is still a possibility that he did murder those people . if you do not believe me  search for him on the internet  and read the articles some people have of him . the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily  was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it . besides that  there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie . the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their  nice and perfect  persona looked difficult to keep up .  br    br   this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully . denzel  s acting is stale  and the supporting cast  s mickey mouse attitudes are annoying . the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring .

810 ===> this slick and gritty film consistently delivers . it  s one of frankenheimer  s best and most underrated films and it  s easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date  and if you are scratching your head thinking  but i loved get shorty  you need to be punched in the face  . in my opinion  no one captures the  feel  for leonard  s characters better then john glover in   pick  up . the relocation of the story from detroit  novel  to hollywood  film  elevates the story  s sleaze factor to amazing heights . be a man  have a few beers and watch this movie . for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are swag  rum punch  cat chaser  city primeval  and   pick  up . my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate . i also have a real special place in my cold  movie heart for dead bang and black sunday .  

=======================================================================================================

811 ===> probably the worst film i  ve ever seen  the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep . the only good actor was colm meaney . i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end  no emotion  no charisma . . . nothing   

=======================================================================================================

812 ===> spoilers   br    br   from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the      news  i wanted to see it . i don  t remember who it was  or which local omaha newscast carried the review  but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church  going nebraskan . they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann  margret when she  s swimming in the pool . glover  s character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth  using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out . i was hooked . there was one problem  though . i was only   years old at the time  and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable . let  s just say  it was worth the wait   br    br   if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine  this movie is it . to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement . the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman . roy scheider  who is as effective as ever  plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains . john glover  s character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time . he  s sleazy  funny at times  and always on the brink of doing something crazy . then there  s robert trebor  s  nice name  by the way   character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme . he is a whimpering  sweating  coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models . then  you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy  a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason . who could forget the wake  up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear   br    br   after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he  s up against  scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation  that is until glover goes after his wife  the conflict is played out brutally  with virtually the entire cast getting shot  raped  or blown up .  br    br   i don  t know why i love this movie so much . it really should creep me out  but it doesn  t . maybe it  s because these characters are all interesting  and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try . it  s scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glover  s running around out in l . a . looking for trouble . just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle .  hey sport  have a nice day    br    br   this film has plenty of shootouts  cool cars  great dialog  like the line in my opening statement   and decent acting . plenty of cameos by real life porno stars . look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glover  s place .  br    br   another thing i must add how hot are the women in this film    wow  travolta did right by marrying kelly preston . yum  we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian . and ann  margret . what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty .  br    br    of   stars .  br    br   so sayeth the hound .  br    br   added feb         rip roy scheider   

=======================================================================================================

813 ===> like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film  especially the  film makers were then attacked  aspect that the case seems to emphasize  what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob .  br    br   then  to watch the film and discover  oh  what they mean by  the film makers were attacked  was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said  someone should beat those two kids up .  the picture on the cover   the chase  as it were  total fabrication . which i guess ties in with the theme of the film  lying and manipulation to satisfy vain  stupid children with more money and time then sense .  br    br   i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film . it  s like michael moore  s  roger  me   but if  roger  me  was moore mocking the people of flint . it  s completely misdirected and totally inane . wow  can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food  what jerks  and it  s not so much   look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah   since it wasn  t just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors  it was that  as many people in the film say  the prices were absurdly low  someone mentions that they should  ve known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck . that  s not proving anything except that people who are poor  will go to a store that has low prices  bravo fellas  way to stick it to the people on the bottom .  br    br   way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people . you should be very proud . how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then  say   haha  no such house exists  your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media   .  br    br   morgan  please like me  spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it  s no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him .  br    br   avoid like the plague .  

=======================================================================================================

814 ===> having only seen two of his pictures previously  i  ve come to terms with altman . before  though  i always labeled his style of film  making  boring .  you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius .  br    br    health  is fairly underrated  and very questionably out of print . in fact  i don  t think it  s ever even been issued to vhs . why is that  when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily  this one is left behind for no good reason  honestly  i had no real problems with this film . it was  for the most part  consistently amusing and funny . almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason  be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances . there is real skill here .  br    br   and paul dooley  s stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating .  br    br   if you can  try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem . it  s not perfect  but it  s much better than most of the sludge out there getting dvd releases . hell  i  d be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thing .  br    br   it  s often on the fox movie channel  though  so look out for it .  

=======================================================================================================

815 ===> i have this film out of the library right now and i haven  t finished watching it . it is so bad i am in disbelief . audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then  although she  d pretty much finished with it in  robin and marian .  this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film . it  s really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide .  br    br   there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies . little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest  palest shadow .  br    br   who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in  breakfast at tiffany  s  twenty years earlier  the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious   you sure don  t have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine  musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you .  br    br    reverting to type  means going back up as well as going back down  i guess . in this case  audrey hepburn  s chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star . here she has even lost her talent as a star . if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period  like ann  margret  had played the role  there would have been some life in it  even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid  level situations .  br    br   hepburn was a great person  of course  greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being  and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors . after this dreadful performance  she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called  love among thieves .  in  they all laughed  it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her    s . even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn . turner took acting seriously even when she was bad . hepburn doesn  t take it seriously at all  couldn  t be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky . her last really good work was in  two for the road   perhaps her most perfect  if possibly not her best in many ways .  br    br   and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening . john ritter is horrible  there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten  who was truly pretty . otherwise  critic david thomson  s oft  used phrase  losing his  her talent  never has made more sense .  br    br   ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then  and so we have  films with gazarra and hepburn   who could ask for anything less  sandra dee  s last  pitiful film  lost   from  years later  a low  budget nothing  had more to it than this . at least ms . dee spoke in her own voice by      audrey hepburn  s accent just sounded silly she  d go on to do the pbs  gardens of the world with audrey hepburn  and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about  what i like most is when flowers go back to nature   as in naturalized daffodils  but in an actual fictional movie  she just sounds ridiculous .  br    br   to think that  breakfast at tiffany  s  was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world   she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in  my fair lady   matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in  last year at marienbad .  and then this  and her final brief role as the angel  hap  in the spielberg film  always  was just more of the lady stuff   corny  witless and stifling .  br    br   i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church  a beautiful service which included a boys  choir singing the shaker hymn  simple gifts .  the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn  s singing  moon river  on the fire escape in  breakfast at tiffany  s   and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation .  br    br   a great lady who was once a fine actress  as in  the nun  s story   and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the    s and    s who became a truly bad one   that  s not all that common . and perhaps it is only a great human being who  in making such things as film performances trivial  nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly   which all of her late film work contained in abundance . most of the talk about hepburn  s miscasting is about  my fair lady .  but the one that should have had the original actress in it was  wait until dark   which had starred lee remick on broadway . never as celebrated as hepburn  she was a better actress in many ways  hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid   although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part . after that  all of her acting went downhill .

816 ===> the sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the    s . its sad that its over  its was the best show on hbo if not on tv  not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think  it was brilliant . the cast was excellent . tony  james gandolphini  is a great actor and played his character excellent  as well as the others . each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long . the last episode was good  i  m not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony didn  t die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense . tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel . . . long live the sopranos and tony soprano . . . . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

817 ===> i don  t know why  but i thought i  ve seen this movie before . maybe it was the name  maybe it was the way poster looked  i don  t know . anyway  it was quite promising in the beginning . and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments . maybe its because i  m not a huge fan of the horrors  and i don  t watch them a lot  but this one actually looked fresh sometimes . but the rest of it is not so good . laughable at times . the movie is slow paced  sometimes you will get so bored you  d forget what was the story about . characters are not great either . all of them . the butcher is ok  seems creepy and crazy enough . although i didn  t get what were those weird looking things on his chest  that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out  of  the  blue   and why he was collecting those in jars at home  the main lead is plain . his character is really hard to believe in  and very undeveloped . but i guess thats scenarists fault . like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend  side cast is bad too . but the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl . my god  when will women in horror movies have any brains  its ridiculous . the girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera  tries going to police  that fails  and then she thinks of the best idea ever . why don  t we just go and take it  i know where the maniac lives  yup  thats swell  and then look for the camera in the bathroom  why not  and then walk in the room  see a bag that was not there before  and just have a look inside . maybe camera is there  not there . but loads of interesting stuff . shiny . mmmm . to realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain . then of course the never ending  falling while running away  trick  that really made it look bad . then  to put the final nail into the character  in the end of the movie  she walks into the wagon full with dead bodies hanging feet up  screams  noooo  like she just ripped her gucci bag  and walks further into the wagon . . . jeez . come on . no one else thinks its just  well  stupid  just awful . if her character wasn  t so bad  maybe the movie would get another star or two from me . and i would even forgive mmt characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer  that dude in the train who the conductor killed   butcher vests that can protect from bullets  weird and cheap looking monsters in the end  i didn  t read clive barkers novel  so i have no idea where those monsters came from   the fact that no one cared that hundreds  judging on the skeletons in the dungeon  disappeared in the city  and main character that didn  t bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out  he barely noticed it i guess  . oh  and the predictable ending . damn  i knew the ending half way in  its just disappointing . the only reason i  m still giving some credit to the makers  is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i  ve watched past few months . visual style is nice  some shots were really nice and good cgi that made the killings look really brutal .  although blood didn  t look real at all  i guess some people will enjoy it  some  like me  will watch it if there is nothing else to watch  some will absolutely hate it .  

=======================================================================================================

818 ===> as the godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite  this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man  s point of view . if you  ve never watched this show  you  re in for an extended treat . yes  there is violence and nudity  but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast tony soprano  the thinking man  s gangster  with the reality of the life he has been born to and  quite frankly  would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up . tony soprano can discuss sun tzu with his therapist  then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage  and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew  take a break  sit down and watch tv while eating peanut butter out of the jar  and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a sunday afternoon of viewing nfl football . even carmella  his wife  when given a chance for a way out  finds that she really prefers life with tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own . if you followed the whole thing  you know how it ends . if you didn  t  trust me you  ve never seen a tv show end like this .  

=======================================================================================================

819 ===> it was no sense and it was so awful . . . i think hollywood have a lot of film like that . . . you don  t have do watch it . people cutter or eater what should i say . . . it made me sick  oh my god  film is about people that we don  t know but feed themselves with humans  they have teeths bla bla bla . . . isn  t that familiar  i can bet on it you saw it in a another movie . the cast was so great but i think scenario was really awful . and i should say that bradley cooper was totally awesome . . . he  s so talented . . . actually i said awful but i think it because of horrible scenes . . . let me explain it . did you ever eat tongue  but in the film one person did it  it was really awful . . . anyway i think film would so good without that awful human eater or cutter scenes . . .  

=======================================================================================================

820 ===> the sopranos  now preparing to end  is the very peak of adult television and drama . when the sopranos hits the mark  it really hits the mark . using great writing and great actors  most of them being extras from goodfellas  the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way . heading up the cast is james gandolfini  who for all intensive purposes is tony soprano  and edie falco  who certainly holds her own . the series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary  usually violence and foul language  . tony sirico  michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting . seasonal extras are also worth note including names like steve buscemi  great    joe pantoliano  great    david proval  good   robert patrick  robert loggia and frank vincent .  br    br   the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv . symbolism and simple story lines  dreams and shoot  outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package . watch it . . .  

=======================================================================================================

821 ===> where to start . the film started out pretty well  but after the   min mark i caught myself watching the clock . the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in . it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by .  br    br   the actors gave an average performance in this movie however  i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the film .  br    br   as the film dragged on  and take my word for it  it dragged on  it just got more and more far fetched .  br    br    spoiler alert  spoiler alert  spoiler alert  just when i thought the film could not get any worse  towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up  just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all . it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end . the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was . once the lead role disposes of vinny jones  he becomes the new killer .  br    br   in closing  this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made . i gave it  star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie    

=======================================================================================================

822 ===> i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes . but if you liked princess bride and forest gump  you would like this movie . you can  t compare the quality of the filming to those of course  but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose . killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite . just my opinion . i  m sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french . so this film isn  t for a world audience . and while i am not a trained film critic  i know what i like . i couldn  t stop laughing through the whole movie . my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie .  

=======================================================================================================

823 ===> i would just like it to be known  that i do not often rate movies below a  . i was originally very excited to see this movie . its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie . so  the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand  i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film .  br    br   the storyline seemed intriguing enough  some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway . there  s a photographer obsessed with the missing people . where are they going  what  s happening to them  one day  the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken  and becomes obsessed with the butcher  following him around  yada yada . the film had a way of sucking you in  even though the plot was highly predictable .  oh no  it  s dark  look out behind you  i say  quite bored with the cheap thrills .  br    br   the plot  even though predictable  was intriguing . . . that is  until the end .  this was good until the end . . . . then it just got silly   says jack  skellington  freke on the message boards . and i fully agree . and here come the spoilers . . .  br    br   see  i was hoping it was some mad killer  some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism . no . it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries . woo . how original . how unrealistic . how dull .  br    br       . come on lionsgate . you  ve had amazing films  but this one sunk .  

=======================================================================================================

824 ===> take a pinch of goodfellas  mix it with the godfather  add some roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy  and you have the sopranos  about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey . it  s almost as entertaining as pro wrestling . i am not the biggest fan of this show  but i do admire james gandolfini  s very complicated tony soprano  a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience . i also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel  voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior  silver  haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous  tough  as  nails carmela soprano . the violence is sudden and graphic  the body count steadily climbs each season  but it is often the small moments that matter most here . watch paulie and tony  s nephew christopher  michael imperioli late of law  order  as they get lost in the pine barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck  both convinced they  ve had it .  

=======================================================================================================

825 ===> i often feel like scrooge  slamming movies that others are raving about  or  i write the review to balance unwarranted raves . i found this movie almost unwatchable  and  unusual for me  was fast  forwarding not only through dull  clichd dialog but even dull  clichd musical numbers . whatever originality exists in this film   unusual domestic setting for a musical  lots of fantasy  some animation   is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought  provoking plot development . individually  june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people  but can  t carry a movie as a team . neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal . they  re both bland . i like billy gray  but his character is pretty one  note . the best part of the film  to me  are june haver  s beautiful costumes and great body .

826 ===> i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it . i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released . in all   episodes so far  the best one is definitely episode    denial  anger  acceptance . this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos . his name was brendan filone . he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver . brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang . in the end  he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath  and that  s my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos . brendan filone is   for me . and my   most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua  who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti . tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him . my   most favorite character is sean gismonte  who was killed right after shooting christopher . and finally  my   most favorite character is chucky signore  one of uncle junior  s henchmen . he was killed on a boat by tony . all the awesome characters are dead . that  s the only bad thing about the sopranos . all the cool guys always get killed . you know what would be great to change about the sopranos  they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris  tony  uncle junior  silvio  and paulie  because they need to get their revenge . brendan filone shall strike back

827 ===> this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling . so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer . this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope . the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds  someone is snorting heroin . if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin  then this would be a pretty good movie . every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere  someone inhaled the white powder . it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie . it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer . the lesbian stuff didn  t bother me . i was looking for a movie about art . i found a movie about drug use .

828 ===> the  gangster  genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody . in retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichs that have been utilized in it  s genre  thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it . the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it  s content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance  humor and unvarnished violence . the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew  however  tony is of two persona  s one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent . with out any inhibitions or contradictions i still adamantly believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory . all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series  but i won  t . if ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital  ambiguous  unrelenting  epic  uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you .

829 ===> woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court . okay  that sounds all right there . it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story . but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film . this movie became redundant  retarded  and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by . woody harrelson played one of my favorite t . v . characters  woody from cheers  and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie . but after seeing his  acting performance  i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend . his acting was as dull and poor as the movie . another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez . i have liked movies with perez before  but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn  t have that many speaking lines  do the right thing  . but now in white men can  t jump she was made a central character with many lines  thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice . so after seeing this film  term used loosely  and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that i  m a white man and i  m getting ready to jump . . . off a twenty story apartment building .

830 ===> wow . i loved the whole series  and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly . perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons     while remaining better than anything else on television . but  and particularly  b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons .  br    br    b started with such a sombre mood and janice  s always keen insight into the family angst  that doom  filled line about knowing tony  s penchant for sitting and staring . anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know tony . melfi  s discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath  s self  deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series  say  with tony  s panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with phil  s  wave bye  bye  line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode  not to get into chase  s dark humour  .  br    br   i could go on and on  but i  ll just add that i thought the final show  starting with the opening strains of vanilla fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow   you keep me hangin  on   to the terminal moments where tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like aj  s suv or phil  s head were  utterly  utterly perfect . the best tv ever .  br    br   pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the  jack  off fantasies  aj derides  and then into which he promptly subsides  . a tip of the pork pie to mr . chase .

831 ===> i really can  t understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than  star . . . how can you like such a retarded film  where all the animal abuse scenes are real  i don  t even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments . . . jesus . . . what kind of   human   would torture them like that for no reason  or just for money  i tell you  that director is either mentally retarded  or he  s just a monster with a   heart   of stone . or both . he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive .  br    br   it contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock  especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive  fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water  a dog is beaten  birds are thrown into the water . . .  br    br   this movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made  along with another one  called   cannibal holocaust   or something like that . i  ll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster . no one should waste their time watching it  especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there  in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged .  br    br   fortunately  only a few people liked this  which is natural  since it  s the worst film ever   so it wasn  t successful . i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised  and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films . i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give  there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel   humans   will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others .  br    br   this  however  is probably my only   negative   review . i usually don  t comment on a movie if i dislike it  but this time i just couldn  t shut up . i had to speak the truth  because animal abuse must stop

832 ===> greetings from this portuguese guy    br    br   i believe the sopranos are one of the best production ever  it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way  that it  s hard to see the difference . it has the same quality as godfather  james gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove  i would love the sopranos would never finish at all . it  s perfect  it should be a subject in school   i saw sopranos when i was a kid  but i was too young to stay waked until the episode ends  so now i bought the all episodes in dvd format and i am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and i am getting addicted  like i did with prison break . in my opinion prison break and the sopranos are the best  ever series made for television . the argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect . congratulations for such a work .  br    br   sorry about my english . thanks for reading .

833 ===> i generally don  t give worry much about violence in films  or a vast amount of philosophy  symbolism or psychology . all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us . there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature  a good setting of characters  a good direction . this film could be voted for as a good film . however  it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting .  br    br   first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film . not movie violence  i am talking about real violence . this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women . not that we all don  t have some real twists with women .  respectively men  . but the conclusion of the film ruins it all .  br    br   spoiler our  heroine  finally dies   by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me  now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch  and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon  nature growing over her  in particular her sex . . of course it is the director who  kills  the women heroine . women have to die  especially if men are attracted by their sexuality . that seems to be the final conclusion . end spoiler  br    br   well  well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself . but to use big pictures  artsy directions cruelty to living creatures  just to say men can be frightened of women  and men are cruel to women . thats just not enough . i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the  philosophical  eastern and artistic  and whatever approach . but to me this film is just totally marred .  

=======================================================================================================

834 ===> the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history .  br    br   its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence  sublime writing or first rate performances .  br    br   across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality . centering around the life of one tony soprano  a man who lives in two families . one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group  of which he is the boss of both . played by james gandolfini  of true romance and the mexican fame  tony is a fascinating  scary but also likable guy . full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man . contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tony .  br    br   the cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever .  br    br   the true genius of this tale however  is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series . twenty minute long dream sequences  powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence . yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love  honour and respect for family . the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous .  br    br   with tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as america  s most original and compelling drama . forget family redifined . this is television redifined .

835 ===> i  m not sure what diane silver was thinking when she was making this movie  but it obviously had nothing to do with richard wright  s novel  which the movie is based on .  br    br   we read the novel this past summer for ap english    and just watched the film . during periodic note  taking and checking of the clock  i contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning . of course  the sky was completely clear  and i was forced to watch the rest of the movie . . . and then write a   paragraph essay on it .  br    br   wright  s novel discussed very real themes  of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it . silver  s movie turned a murderer into a victim  which is not what wright wanted  see  how bigger was born      .  br    br   i  m going to make this short and sweet if you want to leave your consciousness  in raphael lambert  s words  unsullied  skip the movie and read the book . the     adaptation is not thought  provoking material .  br    br   . . . sigh now i have to write the essay .

836 ===> i didn  t at all think of it this way  but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title  midnight cowboy  was a gay porno . at that point  all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that  seinfeld  episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramer  s all sick and with a nosebleed .  br    br   the movie was great  and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies i can  t even remember because they  re all crap .  br    br   the plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler  a male prostitute  basically   thinking it  ll be easy pickings  only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling him  charging him for their sexual encounter .  br    br   then he meets enrico salvatore rizzo  called  ratso  by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time . you think of him as a scoundrel  but a lovable one  like han solo or lando calrissian  and surprisingly he and joe become friends  and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such . rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad  pitiable man who  s very sick  and very depressed and self  conscious  hates being called  ratso  and wants to go to florida  where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved  and he  ll learn to be a cook and be famous there .  br    br   it  s heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida  along with many hilarious moments  like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party  and getting caught by the woman who says  gee  well  you know  it  s free . you don  t have to steal it .  and he says  well if it  s free then i ain  t stealin  it   and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi  and screams  hey  i  m walkin  here  i  m walkin  here     and the acting is so believable  you  d never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight  and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman . it  s not the first time they  ve worked together in lead roles  but the chemistry is so thick and intense .  br    br   then there  s the sad part that i believe is quite an overstatement to call it  depressing  . ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie  can barely walk  barely eat  coughs a lot  is sick  and reaches a head  point on the bus on its way to florida . he  s hurting badly  and only miles away from miami  he finally dies on the bus . the bus driver reassures everyone that nothing  s wrong  and continues on . sad  but not in the kind of way that  d make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you  ve just lost your dog of   years .  br    br   all in all  great movie . and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of  everybody  s talking   played all throughout the movie at appropriate times . an odd move  but a great one  as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly . go see it  it  s great  go buy it  

=======================================================================================================

837 ===> i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit . the script and dialogue is laughable . the acting was awful  where did they get them from  music was ok i have to say . luckily i didn  t buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of .  br    br   i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger  martin sheen  started to tell his story . i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex  s finger off and told him to practise for   years to reach his league . but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter . i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better  never did .  

=======================================================================================================

838 ===> i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in     . after actually seeing it  however  i  m not surprised anymore . it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style  cinematography  and use of flashback to help develop joe buck  s character .  br    br   the most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe buck  s character in such a short movie . i think voight captured the naivete and the viciousness  when  provoked . the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him . i think when he looks in the mirror he  s trying to see if it  s really him that has done  or is about to do  something terrible .  br    br   i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role . otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate . anyway  this considered an all  time great for a reason .

839 ===> a documentarist  like any filmmaker  must convey a compelling story . will pascoe fails utterly in this effort  cobbling together uninspired snippets of chomsky  s wisdom from a visit to mcmaster university in hamilton . the footage is shot amateurishly and in video . pascoe  s only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen         activism    truth .   br    br   lame .  br    br   compare this with documentaries like  the corporation  or  the fog of war  which create a narrative drawing material from interviews  stock footage  and filmed footage . in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently .  br    br   the only saving graces of the film are chomsky  s nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma  and the fact that the running time is only   minutes .  br    br   one of the more interesting passages was chomsky  s recounting of his experience with national public radio . he describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views  while npr  s liberal dogma strait  jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages . yet another media outlet to be skeptical of .  br    br   this documentary is for noam chomsky completists only .

840 ===> acidic  unremitting  and beautiful  john schlesinger  s masterpiece is no less effective today than   years ago  when american life was even more disorienting . the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history  because so many upheavals were taking place in the late     s final dissolution of the great american west  the intensification of war in vietnam  and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety .  br    br    midnight cowboy  is widely known as the only academy award  winning film to garner an  x  rating  but there is much more behind its fame it also exceeds the norm as a work of art . while this film  from the novel by james leo herlihy  has much to say about the erosion of american life  it transcends    s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras . the two main characters  in fact  are standard antiheroes  men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world .  br    br   the initial focus of  midnight cowboy  is on    year  old joe buck  a physically imposing texas native played by jon voight . in the opening scenes  we follow joe  s bus trip to new york city  where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents  the ability to pleasure women  and earn his fortune as a hustler . we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably nave in the sex trade . garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as  one hell of a stud   the young texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with enrico  ratso  rizzo  dustin hoffman   a sickly con man and petty thief from the bronx . ratso  who is short  thin  and with a limp  proves of little monetary help to joe . they quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months  joe and ratso shiver in a condemned manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names . it is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them  the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds .  br    br   throughout the film  joe hearkens back to earlier years in texas  including life with his grandmother sally  ruth white   who served as guardian his harried relationship with  crazy  annie  jennifer salt   a notorious local girl and a traumatic event in which joe and annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair . very much of its time   midnight cowboy  strings together a wild array of flashbacks  dream sequences  and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds . for every moment of understanding we gain from joe and ratso  more questions about their lives are generated . both men are no doubt in tatters they have no clear sense of direction until ratso falls into the throes of illness and joe finally senses a purpose for being alive . this revelation pushes  midnight cowboy  to its conclusion  a rather hopeful one in a very grim story .  br    br   while joe and ratso badly need some luck  the direction of john schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of waldo salt  s screenplay in allowing voight and hoffman to thrive . their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast  which features sylvia miles  brenda vaccaro  and members of the andy warhol clique  offers itself as an essential part of the storyline . the flashback sequences involving voight  ruth white  and jennifer salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost .  br    br   any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film  thanks to the excellent cinematography of adam holender   the boy who could fly    smoke   and editing by hugh robertson   shaft   . the visuals of  midnight cowboy  work with its soundtrack  assembled by john barry  as a cohesive unit  sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades . the lead song everybody  s talking is sung by nilsson  which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase . the memorable harmonica theme is played by jean  toots  thielemans .  br    br    midnight cowboy  has been released in a two  disc collector  s edition by mgm  ua  which contains expanded features and commentary . also available is a     dvd release  used for this review   which offers dual widescreen and standard format with  .  dolby digital sound enhancement three  language subtitles and closed captioning french  dubbing   a theatrical re  release trailer  not the  original  as advertised   and an eight  page production booklet . both dvd editions contain a   th anniversary restored version of the film  showing its original brilliance . well  deserving of its three oscars  best picture  schlesinger  waldo salt  and additional nominations  voight  hoffman  sylvia miles  hugh robertson    midnight cowboy  will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics .  br    br     out of   

=======================================================================================================

841 ===> what more can i say  the acting was  almost without exception  amateurish . the directing and continuity were pitiful . the sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious . one of the features on the dvd was labeled  gag reel  but that could have been a description of a viewer  s reaction to most of the movie .  br    br   one of the most amusing things was in the director  s comments on the dvd . he said  with a straight face  that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast  and that he had succeeded . with delusions like that it  s easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did .  br    br   perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster . the darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit  per the  making of  feature on the dvd  and rather looked it . the mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store . the cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game .  

=======================================================================================================

842 ===> midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in      drawing an x rating . by today  s standards  it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating . jon voight  who has been better  is competent in his role as joe buck  an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city . he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo  who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes . the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic . as ratso  dustin hoffman simply shines . hoffman has often been brilliant  but never more so than in this portrayal . he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison . losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences . director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production  but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer . worth seeing for hoffman  s performance alone .  

=======================================================================================================

843 ===> let me start by saying that i  d read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect . still  i was surprised by just how bad it was .  br    br   i am a big werewolf fan  and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one . most of them have sub  par effects  poor acting  and weak storylines  at best rehashed from earlier films  . so far  with the possible exception of some of the later  howling  series films  this is the worst of the lot .  br    br   first  the story . it  s been quoted several times in reviews on this site  so i won  t go into specifics . however  it is very obvious that the writer  s  had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters . as so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves  above  such fare  they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos . that  s fine  but a non  horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them . the plot feels like a parody of werewolf films  and the events depicted just ring so false that i felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted . tv news footage  for example  never pans away from the reporter to close  up on someone in the crowd behind them . give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign . and that  s just the tip of the iceberg .  br    br   as for effects  i have never seen a less believable werewolf . i  d have been happier with lon chaney jr . in crepe hair . the beast they used look a great deal like . . . well  like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics . and  i know that many people have already criticized the cg  but my god it was awful . one scene features a woman changing  and starts with a completely cg version of the actress  nude but for some reason without nipples . my first thought was   hey  why is one of the characters from  reboot  turning into a silly looking werewolf    br    br   anyway  i like to look for positives in any film  and there were a few . the cinematography was passable  the film was shot all  digital  which is interesting  and some of the performances were not terrible . it was also interesting seeing tippi hedron as the world  s most well made  up homeless woman  and kane hodder as the title bad guy . also  the yellow power ranger got all growed up and . . . well  damn . and if you  re looking for skin  there  s some pretty tasty examples . this ends the male  pig segment of the review .  br    br   overall  if you want a good werewolf film  try  an american werewolf in london   the original  the howling    dog soldiers   or even  the wolfen   though that one  s got more wolf than were  . if you  re a lycanthrope completest  then take a gander . otherwise  give this one a miss .

844 ===> sandra bernhard is quite a character  and certainly one of the funniest women on earth . she began as a stand  up comedienne in the     s  but her big break came in     when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorsese  s underrated masterpiece   the king of comedy  . her film career never quite took off  though . she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures  such as  dallas doll        or  dinner rush         but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself .  br    br    without you i  m nothing  is undoubtedly her best effort . it  s an adaptation of her smash  hit off  broadway show which made her a superstar  and madonna  s best friend for about four years . in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes  sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross  talks about her childhood  andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach  prince  or sylvester . director john boskovich got sandra to do a    minute tour  de  force performance that  s both sexy and uniquely funny . if you are a bernhard fan  you can  t miss out this film it  s a tribute as well to her  weird  beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne . and it has influenced filmmakers in their work   hedwig and the angry inch   for instance  would look a lot different if  without you i  m nothing  didn  t exist .

845 ===> i thought i was going to watch a scary movie . . and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie . in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding . todays computer games have ten times better animations . low budget  is a fitting comment . i would recommend wolf       with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie . it has good special effects as they should be  human transforming to werewolf  . unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie . this movie is a joke .

846 ===> just kidding .  br    br   seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city  jon voight is young optimist cowboy  almost forest gump  like  joe buck from texas . it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its street  thugs . given his pure heart  he takes pity on one of these thugs  ratso rizzo  dustin hoffman  and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive .  br    br   while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama  it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion . it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie  vibe of the late     s with its mandatory dizzying warhol  party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra  urban new york city . the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between  thereby emphasizing his out  of  place position . we feel for his struggle to fit in  but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo .  br    br   midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart . i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its pure  hearted and out  of  place lead character and  to an extent  the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour  a contrast between country  cowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans . very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend .  br    br    .

847 ===> hi  i  m a friend of werewolf movies  and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like  hmm  simple and nice name to it at least . althou . . . i wonder why i haven  t heard of it before .   br    br   first of all  the movie starts with tits . lots of tits . tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to . who cares about a werewolf effect  just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots   br    br   so  about the mysterious darkwolf character  a little spoilers ahead  but who really cares . . .  he  s your average everyday biker . not even super  tough looking  but like the old wise woman says in the movie  he is far more powerful and dangerous than you  ve ever faced before .  just by describing her a tattooed biker  type of a guy . pretty original . i even had look twice when they first used the  red glowing eyes  special effect  i mean my god  that  lets  plant  red  dots  on  eyes  with  computer  effect has been used since the seventies . it looks plain ugly here  and don  t get me started with the werewolf  d  cgi . as said before  like an bad and old video game .  br    br   and finally  as i do like werewolf films  like i said . they prettymuch always build a werewolf  legend of their own . darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well  about some silly legends of hybrid  werewolves and the ancient bloodline . but . it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement  the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched  starts random  slashing . which just doesn  t make any sense  why even bother telling us the rules of killing  when they aren  t even gonna play by them . . . aplus the wolf  point  of  view shots are made with a sony handycam or something  filming mostly the floor and walls . just add growling noises and you  ve got a super werewolf effect . the gore is partially ok . but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand  just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims  it just doesn  t do the trick for me . . .  br    br   truly  who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight  to  video horrortitles  they aren  t even funny  kind of bad movies  just sad .

848 ===> after racism  rural exodus  also known as migration from the country side  is another socio  political issue of the     s . westside story had dealt with racism by a love feast in an artistic view . now  midnight cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view . it has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away .  br    br   director john schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts  dreams  fantasies  fears and evaluations of two new york city scums . while the handsome joe buck  voight  dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy  the poor ratso rizzo  hoffman  dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny florida . accordingly  joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality and ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into florida . besides ratso helps joe to find his way to do whatever he can . they begin sharing everything in life . they share food  they share medicine  they share an uninhabited home  they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny . regrettably as the story progresses  joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun and moreover ratso cannot see florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there .  br    br   the might is always right  and the feeble has no right in the daylight . thence   midnight  gives the factual sight .  br    br   despite the tragedy  there is no melodrama in midnight cowboy . every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate . thanks to this  midnight cowboy is a provocative view of a socio  political issue  the rural exodus .  

=======================================================================================================

849 ===> well  no  not really . its not really a good movie  but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be . i really didn  t feel ripped off of my rental money  and sometimes thats all you can ask for . the plot is ok  nothing brilliant or new  the acting is pretty bad  but the cast is pretty . the directing is passable  but the effects are horrible  especially the werewolf effects  which in a werewolf movie  is a pretty big problem . there was a fairly decent amount of nudity  which to me is a pretty good thing  but it wasn  t all that hot . all in all  its a fairly average direct to video movie  not the worst film i  ve ever seen and if you  re bored a genre fan  check it out sometime . i  d even watch it again .  br    br   bonus fact for horror geeks  kane hodder  jason vorhees in a few of them  plays the werewolf .  

=======================================================================================================

850 ===>   midnight cowboy  was rated x with the original release back in     . there are some scenes where you can understand that  just a little . the movie about joe buck  jon voight  coming from texas to new york city to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing . dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler  making money by the act of love . it does not work out as he planned . after a guy named rico  ratso  rizzo  dustin hoffman  first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends . they live in an empty and very filthy apartment . then ratso gets sick and joe has to try to make some money .  br    br   the movie was probably rated x for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things . the editing in this movie is great . we see dream sequences from joe and ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way . dustin hoffman  jon voight and the supporting actors give great performances . especially hoffman delivers some fine famous lines . the score is done by john barry and sounds great . all this makes this a great movie that won the best picture oscar for a good reason .

851 ===> recap full moon . a creature  a huge werewolf  is on the hunt . not for flesh  not for blood  not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though   but for a mate . he is on the hunt for a girl . not any girl though . the girl . the girl that is pure  and also a werewolf  although she doesn  t know it yet  . three  well check that  two cops  after the first scene  and an old bag lady is all that can stop it  or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf . this particular powerful werewolf  darkwolf  is closing in on the girl . if he gets her  mankind is doomed . now the cops has to find the girl  convince her not only that there is someone  a werewolf nonetheless  that wants to rape her  and perhaps kill her  but that she is a werewolf herself . and then they got to stop him . . .  br    br   comments this is one for the boys  the teenage boys . a lot of scenes with semi  nude girls more or less important for the plot . mostly less . well i guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is  expectedly  thin . and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking . one usually turns to two main themes . nudity . check . and then special effects . hmm . . . well there are some things that you might call effects . they  re not very special though . in fact  to be blunt  they are very bad . the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds . they couldn  t afford clothes for some of the girls    and the effects are cheap . some of the transformations between werewolf and human form  obviously done by computer  are really bad . you might overlook such things . but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too  and you never get to see any killings . just some mutilated corpses afterwards . and there is surprisingly little blood about  in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood .  br    br   i  m not sure what to say about actors and characters . most of the times they do well  but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters  or actors  just looses it . a few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above . like the poor effects  or the poor budget    . that could explain why there is precious little shooting  even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight  and not moving  . but hey  when you  re in real danger  there nothing that will save your life like a good one  liner . . .  br    br   unfortunately that can  t explain moments when the cop  steve  the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem  the werewolf that is  runs away  when the only things he can be sure of  is that the werewolf is coming for the girl  who is just beside him now  and that he cannot let it have her . but sure  it let the makers stretch the ending a little more . . .  br    br   but i wouldn  t mind seeing none of the lead actors  actresses get another try in another movie .  br    br   well . to give a small conclusion not a movie that i recommend .  br    br

852 ===> i sat down to watch  midnight cowboy  thinking it would be another overrated    s     s movie . some of my favorite films come from the    s  in the same vein as  midnight cowboy    taxi driver    mean streets    panic in needle park   etc .  but there are many  many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking  unfortunately a vast majority of them don  t hold up as well today . i sort of feel this way about  easy rider .   although it  too  is one of my favorites .   br    br   so  i didn  t expect much from  midnight cowboy  but got a lot back . it  s a touching story  well  made and well  told with some of the best performances of all time . dustin hoffman  as enrico  ratso  rizzo  gives one of his best  it  s a bit funny at times  he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks  maybe because of the lenny   simpsons  connection   but hoffman is entirely convincing . half of the film  s budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in hollywood . opposite him is the second  billed jon voight as joe buck  the  cowboy  who travels north to the big apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute . soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named  ratso   who offers to become joe  s  manager  for a certain percentage of profits .  br    br   the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long . some films can tend to drag  especially some of the films that were made in the    s because  as it  s been said in  easy riders  raging bulls   the directors were the stars of the movies in the     s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material  going on too long examining characters  scenes  etc . that aren  t important . just about the only scene i felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party  it makes the film seem extremely outdated  similar to the drug odysseys in  easy rider   and really harms its flow because it  s not needed .  br    br   other than that   midnight cowboy  is an almost flawless motion picture . i was pleasantly surprised . it does have its flaws  flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been  for instance  and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy  such as the gay movie theater sequence  but if you can handle its content  midnight cowboy  is a truly great motion picture  an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late    s  early    s . it  s a depressing movie  yes  and by today  s standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of  life is horrible  etc .  . . . but i still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long  long time .  br    br   highly recommended . one of the best films of the    s .  it was technically released in late     but i  d still categorize it as a     s film . it also won the best picture oscar  being the first  and only  x  rated motion picture to do so . it was later re  rated r on appeal .   br    br    .

853 ===> darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie  samaire armstrong  who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary  tippi hedren  is killed by a werewolf  you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america  there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley  ryan olosio  who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself  that a so  called  dark prince  werewolf  kane hodder  wants to mate with her  create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world  or something like that . understandably josie has a hard time believing it  that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes . it  s up to werewolf cop steve to save josie  the day  the world . . .  br    br   co  executive produced  directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn  t really do anything for me . the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show  then there  s a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it  s pretty much down hill all the way i  m afraid . for a start it  s slow going  it  s dull  it  s predictable  it  s populated with highly annoying character  s who come out with lots of bad dialogue  do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don  t  i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead . the script is dumb  doesn  t explain itself  why has josie never turned into a werewolf before  is she really the only one  why can  t this  dark prince  find another female werewolf  there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half  way through but you get the idea anyway  as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least .  br    br   director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original  doesn  t really improve the film as a spectacle . now let  s talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special  the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi  it  s among the worst looking cgi i  ve ever seen  seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics . it  s easily the worst werewolf transformation i  ve ever seen  an american werewolf in london       was made over   years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light  years ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf  who says special effects have improved over the years  the animatronic puppet effects aren  t much better either although at least there  s something psychical on screen . the gore isn  t up to much after a gory opening kill there  s some blood splatter  plenty of dead bodies but not much else . thre  s a fair amount of female nudity if that  s your thing but don  t get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it  is it really worth it   br    br   technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever  it  s reasonably well made  it at least seems to have production values . the acting is what you  d expect really .  br    br   darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves  clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations  i didn  t think it was as bad as some but it  s like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said  done they  re both horrible still . . .

854 ===> virile  but naive  big joe buck leaves his home in big spring  texas  and hustles off to the big apple in search of women and big bucks . in nyc  jb meets up with frustration  and with  ratso  rizzo  a scruffy but cordial con artist . somehow  this mismatched pair manage to survive each other which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty  sometimes brutal  urban america  en route to a poignant ending .  br    br   both funny and depressing  our  midnight cowboy  rides head  on into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change  and thus confirms to     viewers that they  themselves  have been swept away from the      s age of innocence  and dropped  dorothy and toto like  into the      s age of aquarius .  br    br   the film  s direction is masterful the casting is perfect the acting is top notch the script is crisp and cogent the cinematography is engaging and the music enhances all of the above . deservedly  it won the best picture oscar of      and i would vote it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade .  

=======================================================================================================

855 ===> this move was on tv last night . i guess as a time filler  because it sucked bad  the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way .  not bad tits and ass though  . but the story is too ridiculous for words . the  wolf   if that is what you can call it  is hardly shown fully save his teeth . when it is fully in view  you can clearly see they had some interns working on the cgi  because the wolf runs like he  s running in a treadmill  and the cgi fur looks like it  s been waxed  all shiny    br    br   the movie is full of gore and blood  and you can easily spot who is going to get killed  slashed  eaten next . even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed  they didn  t do a good job at it .  br    br   don  t even get me started on the actors . . . very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every  seconds . but then again  if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks  then hey  where do i sign up   br    br   overall boring and laughable horror .  

=======================================================================================================

856 ===> i typically don  t like reality shows  particularly the ones that are profiting off of  american idol   s success . but this one i can live with .  br    br   comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts  and if they like them  those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience . then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do  survivor  style competitions using comedic tactics . then one will be determined as  last comic standing .  i do like stand up comedy  so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests . there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through . it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden  ralphie may  and josh blue .  br    br   my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama . at first they lived together in a house like  big brother   but now they  ve done away with that  thank god .  br    br   and there are a lot of comedians i felt  were only chosen not because they  re funny  but because of race  ethnicity  attitude  sex  etc . when other comics clearly should  ve beaten them out . but overall  it  s a well  made reality show  which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron .  

=======================================================================================================

857 ===> hip . erotic . wickedly sexy . . . whatever . it  s  the terminator  with werewolves .  br    br   no  seriously . the cop saves the girl  waitress   from the big monster and refers to himself as her  protector  . the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese . . . there  s a massacre in a police precinct . . . the bad guy is muscular with red eyes . . . and it even contains dialogue along the lines of  you said it yourself  he won  t ever stop . never .  the dire script comes from a first  time screenwriter who  thank god  hasn  t sold anything since this  and it  s all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedman .  br    br   the movie opens in a strip bar  always a good sign   and a mean  looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason  pursued by three cops . one of them is black  and  shock horror   he  s the one who gets killed in the first five minutes . the film goes downhill for the next hour or so  then picks up a little with some decent action sequences  before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending .  br    br   for the most part  the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who  s willing to settle for less . if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio  along with some of the supporting cast  shows signs of talent . darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder   famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the  friday the   th  movies . he  s decent enough  especially considering he isn  t used to speaking roles .  br    br   it  s become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams  who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former  power rangers  actresses . and it  s unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene . . . anyway  the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good  and the design of the wolf isn  t bad at all . but the cgi is bad . just plain bad . i mean seriously  if you can  t reach some level of realism  why bother  just throw a little extra money into the make  up  aside from the terrible script  this movie does have it  s moments  many of which are unintentionally funny . it  s good for a laugh if you don  t have anything better to do  but just don  t spend any money on it . please .  

=======================================================================================================

858 ===> this is a wonderful film . . . first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and women  s baser motivations diverge  vive la difference    br    br   you can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses . human beings are a bit rubbish really  but we have big hearts and we try our best  despite temptation . it  s not our fault when sometimes temptation can  t be resisted  that  s just who we are .  br    br   there is a consistent stylishness from start to finish crisp photography and sharp composition  very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content  well suited music and laugh out loud scripting .  br    br   watch out for the very young  lone wise voice  . . . brilliant wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition .  

=======================================================================================================

859 ===> we saw this on the shelf at the local video store  saw  coppola  in the credits and got excited . that was the one and only time this movie raised any interest . i could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably  or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably . in general  the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish . the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful  especially in the scenes shot in the little bar the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable . very disappointing .  

=======================================================================================================

860 ===> this is a very funny movie  i have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not . however  i do think men all over the world can identify with  frank  and his thoughts to some extent  these thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie i  m sure   br    br   all cast members perform well  and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in england or the us . but for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand swedish  you are in for a treat   br    br   highly recommended .  

=======================================================================================================

861 ===> jack black is an annoying character . this is an annoying indie movie for   year olds . do i have to write eight more lines  ana de la reguera is dang fine to look at  as a mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of jack black . this movie is a pg   version of an indie film . i really like a movie that has the courage to explore mexican culture . this movie explores mexican culture  deeply . i just choke on its cultural rudenessjack black is just so rude . a white person like jack black is not my most valuable emissary into mexican culture  as it were . mexican wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy  such as myself could seek . i suspect mexico is more culturally opaque than jack black has presented here .  br    br   i think imdb changed my review . has anyone else had his review changed as well  just a question .

862 ===> in brooklyn a century ago  the rivalry between chuck connors and steve brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to brodie  s famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridge . this is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a bugs bunny spoof   bowery bugs  from     .  br    br   this generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some chinese tenement dwellers   a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes  giving the film a great deal of historical interest  in my view .  

=======================================================================================================

863 ===> i mean  really . . . either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie . it  s stupid  ridiculous and just not funny at all .  br    br   since i saw the preview i knew it wasn  t going to be a great movie  i just didn  t think it was gonna be that bad . . .  br    br   what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie  when the actors didn  t have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny  . now we find ourselves with movies like this one  borat  little men  scary movie  where i could not find the funny parts    br    br   just skip this piece of garbage  br    br   p . s .  sorry for my english

864 ===> a favourite of mine  this movie tells of two feuding new york  characters   steve brodie  raft  and  chuck  connors  beery   who both strive to be the  main guy  in the bowery in the late nineteenth century .  br    br   brodie            and connors             were real people  though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics  based on a play  . brodie  s legendary  did he do it   it  s still a cause of argument    jump from the brooklyn bridge        for which he became famous  is shown here as happening around the same time as the spanish  american war       . director walsh clearly had a great affection for the period  so beautifully recreated here  and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer trixie odbray  a young pert kelton  . raft is at his slickest as brodie  and beery shows again what a clever actor he was  as tough  big hearted  and at times quite touching connors . pretty fay wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing .  br    br   full of life and energy   the bowery  moves at a fast pace  unlike many early  talkies   . it is not an easy movie to find  but is well worth looking out for .

865 ===>   a mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something   br    br   i went to see this movie because it was about non  wwf wrestling and so i thought it might be funny . it wasn  t . it is excruciating to watch . embarrassing . any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered .  br    br   i admit i don  t like jack black anyway . after this i have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed . the only thing i can come up with where he was o . k . was as a necessary foil to the john cusack character in  high fidelity  . jack black is one of those awful relentless flat  out ham  it  up knockabout guys  like the little fat one in abbot  costello or jerry lewis  who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny .  br    br   it is not even slapstick . it  s just irritating . it  s not even stoopid  it  s just stupid .  br    br   i heard good things about napoleon dynamite too  but if this is anything to go by i wont be rushing out to find it on dvd .

867 ===> there is a reason why this made for british tv movie only appeared at the     toronto film festival . it is dull  plodding and lacking in suspense .  br    br   peter otooles diffident performance and the appearance of playwright harold pinter are the only elements of interest .  br    br   note  some british film fans will enjoy seeing philip jackson  best known for his portrayal of inspector japp in the poirot television series  in one of his earliest roles . . . .  

=======================================================================================================

868 ===> personally  i absolutely love this movie and novel  i read the book first and decided to see the movie  . first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind . the acting is also great and i love the cast . judd crandall  plays fred gwynne  fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you . there are also a few corny lines thrown in there  idk if they were meant to be corny   but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh . the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie . not only will you love it but you  ll want to see it again and again  i recommend this     to any horror fan

869 ===> if it wasn  t for the bad dialogues and script . i mean  the direction was really in touch with it  s subject . the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life . but in the end  the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together . i would highly suggest not to watch this . unless you  re a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everything he is playing in . even if the result lately are rather poor . this is  after s  m  ne  a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles .  

=======================================================================================================

870 ===> so often with stephen king adaptations  you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books . this really captures the heart of the book . maybe because they don  t use large chunks of text straight from the book  but it  s a bit more of an improv of the events in the story . a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage . dale midkiff and denise  tasha yar  crosby really act like his parents . there  s a scene where louis is cuddling gage  and they are very natural together . fred gwynne is wonderful . he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody  and is wise and warm just like jud should be .   out of     

=======================================================================================================

871 ===> saw this movie in an early preview  and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was . from the very beginning  the audience was groaning over pacino  s awful southern accent . poor al looked really  really haggard  and i can  t decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist  or perhaps he just didn  t get any sleep before coming to the set . much worse than pacino  s close ups  however  is the wretched excuse for a plot . early in the film we are given indications that pacino  s character is gay  and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended . later  however  we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger  both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles  lust after this elderly  half dead looking  effeminate man with the ridiculous accent . the worst part overall was the main plot thread  which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never  ever care about in the slightest . because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment  because of the possibility of re  shoots and editing  but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters .  

=======================================================================================================

872 ===> minor spoiler  br    br   underrated little stephen king shocker . it  s not perfect  by any stretch of the imagination   even if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better  there  d still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with . the old micmac burial ground  rachel  s terminally ill sister  and the jacob  marley  an victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent  and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed . but few horror movies really are perfect  and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock . pet sematary  may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory  with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda . it  s politically incorrect  it  s tasteless  it  s gratuitous   and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way safer  horror movies never can . add to that one of fred gwynne  s best performances and mary lambert  s witty direction  and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie   even with the hokey ending . highly recommended for genre fans .  .  out of   .  

=======================================================================================================

873 ===> much as we all love al pacino  it was painful to see him in this movie . a publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accent .  br    br   the plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels  and then retreats  .  br    br   kim basinger is there  not doing much . her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing . hard to believe they meant a lot to each other . there  s no energy there .  br    br   tea leone  on the other hand  lit up the screen . she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie  but not enough to save al from embarrassment .  

=======================================================================================================

874 ===> making a book into a movie by following the story page  by  page is never a good idea . when people read the book  they automatically start making their own  mental movie  of who the characters look like  the places they exist in  how the situations progress . and everybody  s mind  s  eye opus is different  which is why when the  real  movie finally comes out  you  re always going to have a ticked  off segment of the movie  going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn  t measure up .  br    br   all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is  and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see .  br    br   there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king . when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories  the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying  carrie   salem  s lot  the dead zone   or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd  awful mess  kubrick  s version of the shining the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers  .  br    br   although it  s not even close to being the perfect king adaptation  pet sematary has so many moments of just skin  and  bone  deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book  that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings . for that  we have music video  turned  film director mary lambert to thank   she also directed siesta  not exactly a horror movie  but another freaky  as  hell must  see you should put on your list   working from a screenplay by the  man  ster  himself  and probably one of his better ones .  br    br   since the majority of you know the story  i won  t put you to sleep with too many of the details . dr . louis creed  dale midkiff  has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country . well  almost perfect  except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front  and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back . since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son . . . well  even if you haven  t read the book  do the frickin  math . it is a king story  after all  so no mystery where this is headed .  br    br   it  s not so much the destination that counts here  but the spooky stops along the way . certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery  scream  inducing life here rachel creed  s  star trek  s denise crosby  horrific memory of her terminally ill  crippled sister louis  s encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow  brad greenquist   both before and after his death the trip into the  other  cemetery beyond the pet cemetery . and that third act . . . if it doesn  t give you a few nightmares  maybe you should check your pulse .  br    br   good performances by all here  especially the late fred gwynne as the well  intentioned neighbor  jud crandall  who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up  sometimes  dead is better .   br    br   about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louis  s son  gage  miko hughes  . knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this  lambert and crew still did the best they could  and unfortunately  hughes at the time was just too damn cute to  sell  his intended role as an evil  demon  possessed zombie . this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up  though the scenes where he  s featured are still masterfully staged   especially gwynne  s death scene .   br    br   other than that  everything else is still about as good as it gets . carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i  m concerned but sematary is right up there in the top five .  br    br   still  will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story  not bloody likely . . . for now .  

=======================================================================================================

875 ===> the movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call  girl  the other an upper  class political party . the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino  as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening .  br    br   if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama  the performance of al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man  as  the godfather   as here as a little servant  see also  donnie brasco   .  br    br   actually  the big young lion has become a tired old one . this passing of ages is very moving  because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too .  br    br   but his slowness is only a make  up because he can get back his energy in church scene .  br    br   maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on al  s talent

876 ===>   pet sematary  is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title . the story follows the creeds  an all american  middle  class family  who move into a house out in the country . the family consists of louis and rachel  and their two young children  ellie and their toddler son  gage . the house couldn  t be better  and the family meets a strange but friendly old man  jud  who lives across the road . he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies  filled with a huge amount of animal graves . and just beyond there  lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power . when the family cat  church  is killed  louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery  and strangely enough  soon after  church returns to life . but there  s something evil about him now  he isn  t the same cat he used to be . and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage  louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son . . . unfortunately  he gets more than he bargained for .  br    br   having read stephen king  s novel  i can say that the book is much better than the film . not to say the movie is bad  because it isn  t  the book is just a little bit better . the real strength in this film lies in it  s story  which is both bizarre but extremely original  something that king  s stories are typically known for . the script is very well adapted from the story  and while it minorly differs in some aspects  it  s a pretty good page  to  screen transformation . there are a few plot holes here and there  nothing major though . besides that  this movie is actually pretty scary  and it succeeds in it  s intention to do so . there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film  and i  d have to say that the flashback sequence of rachel  s sister zelda is the number one . honestly  that is one of the most disgusting  disturbing things i  ve ever seen in a horror film  it  s not gory and bloody  it  s just flat out sickening . one thing  s for sure  that image won  t leave your head anytime soon .  br    br   the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there . this film is actually on the gory side  there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there  including the shocker of an ending . i really liked the way they ended the film  it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive  but it worked better that way with all things considered .  br    br   overall   pet sematary  is a good horror movie that i  d recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general . the story is the film  s greatest asset and it  s a creepy one too . one of the better stephen king adaptations i  d say .     .
